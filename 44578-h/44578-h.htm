<hr class="r5" />
<p class="indent">At the end of a theatrical season it is customary
for the manager to step forward, and, in as few words as
may be, to say how very much obliged he feels for all
past favours, and how very ready he is to incur fresh obligations.</p>

<p class="indent">With a degree of candour which few managers would
display, we cheerfully confess that we have been fairly
inundated with <i>orders</i> during our six months' campaign;
but so liberal are we, notwithstanding, that we place
many of the very first authors of the day on our free
list, and invite them to write for our establishment just
as much paper as they think proper.</p>

<p class="indent">We have produced a great variety of novelties,
some of which we humbly hope may become stock pieces, and
all of which we may venture to say have been must successful;
and, although we are not subject to the control
of a licenser, we have eschewed everything political,
personal, or ill-natured, with perhaps as much care as
we could possibly have shown, even had we been under
the watchful eye of the Lord Chamberlain himself.</p>

<p class="indent">We shall open our Second Volume, ladies and
gentlemen, on the first day of July, One thousand eight hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
and thirty-seven, when we shall have the pleasure
of submitting a great variety of entirely new pieces for
your judgment and approval. The company will be
numerous, first-rate, and complete. The scenery will
continue to be supplied by the creative pencil of Mr.
George Cruikshank; the whole of the extensive and
beautiful machinery will be, as heretofore, under the
immediate superintendence of Mr. Samuel Bentley, of
Dorset-street, Fleet-street; and Mr. Richard Bentley, of
New Burlington-street, has kindly consented to preside
over the Treasury department, where he has already
conducted himself with uncommon ability.</p>

<p class="indent">The stage management will again be confided,
ladies and gentlemen, to the humble individual with the short
name, who has now the honour to address you, and who
hopes, for very many years to come, to appear before you
in the same capacity. Permit him to add in sober
seriousness, that it has been the constant and unremitting
endeavour of himself and the proprietor to render
this undertaking worthy of your patronage. That they
have not altogether failed in their attempt, its splendid
success sufficiently demonstrates; that they have no intention
of relaxing in their efforts, its future Volumes
we trust will abundantly testify.</p>

<h2>PROLOGUE.</h2>

<span class="i10">For us, and our Miscellany,</span>

<p class="indent">"Doctor," said a young gentleman to Dean Swift, "I intend
to set up for a wit."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then," said the Doctor, "I advise you to sit down again."</p>

<p class="indent">The anecdote is unratified by a name, for the young
gentleman continues to the present day to be anonymous, as he will,
in all probability, continue to future time; and as for Dean
Swift, his name, being merely that of a wit by profession,
goes for nothing. We apprehend that the tale is not much
better than what is to be read in the pages of Joe Miller.</p>

<p class="indent">But, supposing it true,&mdash;and the joke is quite bad
enough to be authentic,&mdash;we must put in our plea that it is not to apply
to us. The fact is absolutely undeniable that we originally advertised
ourselves or rather our work as, the "Wits' Miscellany,"&mdash;thereby
indicating, beyond all doubt, that we of the Miscellany
were <span class="smcap">Wits</span>. It is our firm hope that the public,
which is in general a most tender-hearted individual, will not give us a
rebuff similar to that which the unnamed young gentleman experienced
at the hands, or the tongue, of the implacable Dean of St. Patrick.</p>

<p class="indent">It has been frequently remarked,&mdash;and indeed we have
more than fifty times experienced the fact ourselves,&mdash;that of all the
stupid dinner-parties, by far the stupidest is that at which the
cleverest men in all the world do congregate. A single lion is a
pleasant show: he wags his tail in proper order; his teeth are
displayed in due course; his hide is systematically admired,
and his mane fitly appreciated. If he roars, good!&mdash;if he
aggravates his voice to the note of a sucking-dove, better! All
look on in the appropriate mood of delight, as Theseus and
Hippolita, enraptured at the dramatic performance of Snug the
Joiner. But when there comes a menagerie of lions, the case is
altered. Too much familiarity, as the lawyers say in their peculiar
jargon, begets contempt. We recollect, many years ago,
when some ingenious artist in Paris proposed to make Brussels
lace or blonde by machinery at the rate of a <i>sou</i> per ell, to have
congratulated a lady of our acquaintance on this important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
saving in the main expenditure of the fair sex. "You will
have," said we, "a cap which now costs four hundred francs for
less than fifty. Think of that!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Think of that!" said the countess, casting upon us
the darkest expression of indignation that her glowing eyes [and
what eyes they were!&mdash;but no matter] could let loose,&mdash;"think
of that, indeed! Do you think that I should ever wear such
rags as are to be bought for fifty francs?"</p>

<p class="indent">There was no arguing the matter: it was useless to say
that the fifty-franc article, if the plan had succeeded, (which, however,
it did not,) would have been precisely and in every thread
the same as that set down at five hundred. The crowd of fine
things generated by cheapness, in general, was quite enough to
dim the finery of any portion of them in particular.</p>

<p class="indent">We are much afraid that we run somewhat loose of our
original design in these rambling remarks. But it is always easy
to come back to the starting-post. Abandoning metaphor and
figure of all kinds, we were endeavouring to express our conviction,
drawn from experience, that a company of professed
wits might be justly suspected to be a dull concern. Every
man is on the alert to guard against surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">This is, we admit at once, and in anticipation of the
reader's already expressed opinion, a very poor imitation of the opening
song of the Beggar's Opera.</p>

<p class="indent">If this melancholy fact of the stupidity of congregated
wits be admitted to be true, the question comes irresistibly, thrown
in our faces in the very language of the street, "Who are <i>you</i>?
Have not you advertised yourselves as wits, and can you escape
from the soft-headed impeachment?" We reply nothing; we
stand mute. It will be our time this day twelvemonths to offer
to the pensive public a satisfactory replication to that somewhat
personal interrogatory. Yet&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Having in our minds, and the interior <i>sensoria</i> of
our consciences, some portion of modesty yet lingering behind&mdash;how
small that portion may be is best known to those who have campaigned
for a few years upon the press, and thence learned the
diffident mildness which naturally adheres to the pursuit of enlightening
the public mind, and advancing the march of general
intellect;&mdash;possessed, we say, of that quantity of retiring bashfulness,
it is undeniable that, like one of the Passions in Collins's
Ode,&mdash;we forget which, but we fear it is Fear,&mdash;we, after showing
forth in the best public instructors as the Wits' Miscellany,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i34">Back recoiled,</span>
<span class="i10">Scared at the sound ourselves had made.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">To this resolution we were also led by the fact, that
such a title would altogether exclude from our pages contributions of
great merit&mdash;which, although exhibiting comic faculty, would
also deal with the shadows of human life, and sound the deep
wells of the heart.</p>

<p class="indent">We agreed that the work should not be called "The Wits'"
any longer. We massacred the title as ruthlessly as ever were massacred
its namesakes in Holland: and, agreeing to an <i>emendatio</i>,
we now sail under the title of our worthy publisher, which
happens to be the same as that of him who is by all <i>viri
clarissimi</i> adopted as <i>criticorum longè doctissimus</i>, <span class="smcap">Ricardus
Bentleius</span>; or, to drop Latin lore&mdash;Richard Bentley.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Here then, ladies and gentlemen, we introduce to your
special and particular notice</p>
<p class="f120"><b>BENTLEY'S MISCELLANY.</b></p>

<p class="indent space-above1">What may be in the Miscellany it is your business
to find out. Here lie the goods, warehoused, bonded, ticketed, and labelled,
at your service. You have only, with the Genius in the Arabian
Nights' Entertainments, to cry, "Fish, fish, do your duty;"
and if they are under-cooked or over-cooked, if the seasoning is
too high or the fire too low, if they be burnt on one side and
raw on the other,&mdash;why, gentle readers, it is your business to
complain. All we have to say here, is, that we have made our
haul in the best fishing-grounds, and, if we were ambitious of
pun-making, we might add, that we had well baited our <i>hooks</i>&mdash;caught
some choice <i>souls</i>&mdash;flung our lines into right <i>places</i>&mdash;and
so forth, as might easily he expanded by the students of Mr.
Commissioner Dubois's art of punning made easy.</p>

<p class="indent">What we propose is simply this:&mdash;We do not envy
the fame or glory of other monthly publications. Let them all have their
room. We do not desire to jostle them in their course to
fame or profit, even if it was in our power to do so. One may
revel in the unmastered fun and the soul-touching feeling of
Wilson, the humour of Hamilton, the dry jocularity and the ornamented
poetry of Moir, the pathos of Warren, the tender sentiment of
Caroline Bowles, the eloquence of Croly, and the
Tory brilliancy of half a hundred contributors zealous in the
cause of Conservatism. Another may shake our sides with the
drolleries of Gilbert Gurney and his fellows, poured forth from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the inexhaustible reservoir of the wit of our contributor Theodore
Hook,&mdash;captivate or agitate us by the Hibernian Tales of
Mrs. Hall,&mdash;or rouse the gentlest emotions by the fascinating prose
or delicious verse of our fairest of <i>collaborateuses</i> Miss Landon.
In a third we must admire the polyglot facetiæ of our
own Father Prout, and the delicate appreciation of the classical
and elegant which pervades the writings of the Greek-thoughted
Chapman; while its rough drollery, its bold bearing, its
mirth, its learning, its courage, and its caricatures, (when,
confined to the harmless and the mirth-provoking, they abstain
from invading the sanctuary of private life,) are all deserving
of the highest applause, though we should be somewhat
sorry to stand in the way of receiving the consequences
which they occasionally entail. Elsewhere, what can be better
than Marryat, Peter Simple, Jacob Faithful, Midshipman Easy,
or whatever other title pleases his ear; A Smollett of the sea
revived, equal to the Doctor in wit, and somewhat purged of his
grossness. In short, to all our periodical contemporaries we
wish every happiness and success; and for those among their
contributors whose writings tend to amuse or instruct,&mdash;and
many among them there are to whom such praise may be justly
applied,&mdash;we feel the highest honour and respect. We wish
that we could catch them all, to illuminate our pages, without
any desire whatever that their rays should be withdrawn from
those in which they are at present shining.</p>

<p class="indent">Our path is single and distinct. In the first place,
we have nothing to do with politics. We are so far Conservatives as to
wish that all things which are good and honourable for our native
country should be preserved with jealous hand. We are
so far Reformers as to desire that every weed which defaces our
conservatory should be unsparingly plucked up and cast away.
But is it a matter of absolute necessity that people's political opinions
should be perpetually obtruded upon public notice? Is there
not something more in the world to be talked about than Whig
and Tory? We do not quarrel with those who find or make it
their vocation to show us annually, or quarterly, or hebdomadally,
or diurnally, how we are incontestably saved or ruined;
they have chosen their line of walk, and a pleasant one no
doubt it is; but, for our softer feet may it not be permitted
to pick out a smoother and a greener promenade,&mdash;a path of
springy turf and odorous sward, in which no rough pebble will
lacerate the ancle, no briery thorn penetrate the wandering sole?</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Truce, however, to prefacing. We well know
that speechmaking never yet won an election, because something more
tangible than speechifying is requisite. So it is with books;
and, indeed, so is it with every thing else in the world. We
must be judged by our works. We have only one petition to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
make, which is put in with all due humility,&mdash;it is this&mdash;that
we are not to be pre-judged by this our first attempt. Nothing
is more probable than that many of our readers, and they fair-going
people too, will think this number a matter not at all to
be commended; and we, with perfect modesty, suggest, on the
other side, the propriety of their suspending their opinion as
to our demerits until they see the next. And then&mdash;&mdash;And
then! Well!&mdash;what then? Why, we do not know: and, as
it is generally ruled, that, when a man cannot speak, he is bound
to sing, we knock ourselves down for a song.</p>

<h2>GEORGE COLMAN.</h2>

<p class="indent">That a life of this eminent and much regretted man
will be written by some competent author, there can be little doubt.
That he himself extended his "<i>Random Records</i>" no further
than two volumes, containing the history and anecdotes of the
early part of his career, is greatly to be lamented. What is
here collected is merely worthy of being called "Recollections,"
and does not assume to itself the character of a piece of biography.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Colman was the grandson of Francis Colman, Esq.
British Resident at the Court of Tuscany at Pisa, who married a sister
of the Countess of Bath. George Colman the elder, father of
him of whom we write, was born about the year 1733, at Florence,
and was placed at an early age at Westminster School,
where he very soon distinguished himself by the rapidity of his
attainments. In 1748 he went to Christchurch College, Oxford,
where he took his Master's degree; and shortly became the
friend and associate of Churchill, Bonnell Thornton, Lloyd,
and the other principal wits and writers of the day.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Bath was greatly struck by his merit and
accomplishments, and induced him to adopt the law as his profession.
He accordingly entered at Lincoln's Inn, and was eventually called
to the bar. It appears&mdash;as it happened afterwards to his son&mdash;that
the drier pursuits of his vocation were neglected or abandoned
in favour of literature and the drama. His first poetical
performance was a copy of verses addressed to his cousin, Lord
Pulteney. But it was not till 1760 that he produced any dramatic
work: in that year he brought out "Polly Honeycombe,"
which met with considerable success.</p>

<p class="indent">It is remarkable that, previous to that season, no new
comedy had been produced at either theatre for nine years; and equally
remarkable that the year 1761 should have brought before the
public "The Jealous Wife," by Colman, "The way to Keep
Him," by Murphy, and "The Married Libertine," by Macklin.</p>

<p class="indent">In the following year Lord Bath died, and left Mr. Colman
a very comfortable annuity, but less in value than he had anticipated.
In 1767, General Pulteney, Lord Bath's successor, died,
and left him a second annuity, which secured him in independence
for life. And here it may be proper to notice a subject
which George Colman the younger has touched before in his
"Random Records," in which he corrects a hasty and incautious
error of the late Margravine of Anspach, committed by her, in
her "Memoirs." Speaking of George Colman the elder, she says,</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"He was a natural son of Lord Bath, Sir James
Pulteney; and his father, perceiving in the son a passion for plays, asked
him fairly if he never intended to turn his thoughts to politics,
as it was his desire to see him a minister, which, with his natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
endowments, and the expense and pains he had bestowed on his
education, he had reason to imagine, with his interest, he might
become. His <i>father</i> desired to know if he would give up the
Muses for diplomacy, and plays for politics; as, in that case,
he meant to give him his whole fortune. Colman thanked Lord
Bath for his kind communication, but candidly said, that he
preferred Thalia and Melpomene to ambition of any kind, for
the height of his wishes was to become, at some future time, the
manager of a theatre. Lord Bath left him fifteen hundred
pounds a-year, instead of all his immense wealth."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Colman, after exposing the strange mistake of calling
<i>the</i> Sir William Pulteney, James, goes on to state, that, being
the son of his wife's sister, Lord Bath, on the death of Francis
Colman (his brother-in-law), which occurred when the elder
George was but one year old, took him entirely under his protection,
and placed him progressively at Westminster, Oxford,
and Lincoln's Inn. In corroboration of the else unquestioned
truth of this statement, he refers to the posthumous pamphlets
of his highly-gifted parent, and justly takes credit for
saving him from imputed illegitimacy, by explaining that his
grandmother was exempt from the conjugal frailty of Venus,
and his grandfather from the fate of Vulcan.</p>

<p class="indent">George Colman the elder suffered severely from the effects
of a paralytic affection, which, in the year 1790, produced mental
derangement; and, after living in seclusion for four years, he
died on the 14th of April 1794, having been during his life a
joint proprietor of Covent Garden Theatre, and sole proprietor
of the little theatre in the Haymarket.</p>

<p class="indent">George Colman the younger became, at Westminster,
the schoolfellow and associate of the present Archbishop of York,
the Marquess of Anglesea, the late Earl of Buckinghamshire,
Doctor Robert Willis, Mr. Reynolds, his brother dramatist, the
present Earl Somers, and many other persons, who have since,
like himself, become distinguished members of society.</p>

<p class="indent">The account which Mr. Colman gives of his introduction
by his father to Johnson, Goldsmith, and Foote, when a child, is so
highly graphic, and so strongly characteristic of the man, that
we give an abridgement of it here:</p>

<p class="indent">"On the day of my introduction," says Colman, "Dr.
Johnson was asked to dinner at my father's house in Soho-square, and
the erudite savage came a full hour before his time. My father,
having dressed himself hastily, took me with him into the drawing-room.</p>

<p class="indent">"On our entrance, we found Johnson sitting in a <i>fauteuil</i>
of rose-coloured satin. He was dressed in a rusty suit of brown,
cloth <i>dittos</i>, with black worsted stockings; his old yellow wig
was of formidable dimensions; and the learned head which sustained
it rolled about in a seemingly paralytic motion; but, in
the performance of its orbit, it inclined chiefly to one shoulder.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"He deigned not to rise on our entrance; and we stood
before him while he and my father talked. There was soon a pause in
the colloquy; and my father, making his advantage of it, took
me by the hand, and said,&mdash;'Dr. Johnson, this is a little
Colman.' The doctor bestowed a slight ungracious glance upon
me, and, continuing the rotary motion of his head, renewed the
previous conversation. Again there was a pause;&mdash;again the
anxious father, who had failed in his first effort, seized the
opportunity for pushing his progeny, with&mdash;'This is my son,
Dr. Johnson.' The great man's contempt for me was now roused
to wrath; and, knitting his brows, he exclaimed in a voice of
thunder, 'I <i>see</i> him, sir!' He then fell back in his rose-coloured
satin <i>fauteuil</i>, as if giving himself up to meditation;
implying that he would not be further plagued, either with an
old fool or a young one.</p>

<p class="indent">"After this rude rebuff from the doctor, I had the
additional felicity to be placed next to him at dinner: he was silent
over his meal; but I observed that he was, as Shylock says of
Lancelot Gobbo, 'a huge feeder;' and during the display of
his voracity, (which was worthy of <i>Bolt</i> Court,) the perspiration
fell in copious drops from his visage upon the table-cloth."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oliver Goldsmith, several years before my luckless
presentation to Johnson, proved how 'doctors differ.' I was only
five years old when Goldsmith took me on his knee, while he
was drinking coffee, one evening, with my father, and began to
play with me; which amiable act I returned with the ingratitude
of a peevish brat, by giving him a very smart slap in the
face; it must have been a tingler, for it left the marks of my
little spiteful paw upon his cheek. This infantile outrage was
followed by summary justice; and I was locked up by my
indignant father in an adjoining room, to undergo solitary imprisonment
in the dark. Here I began to howl and scream
most abominably; which was no bad step towards liberation,
since those who were not inclined to pity me might be likely to
set me free, for the purpose of abating a nuisance.</p>

<p class="indent">"At length a generous friend appeared to extricate me
from jeopardy, and that generous friend was no other than the man
I had so wantonly molested by assault and battery; it was the
tender-hearted doctor himself, with a lighted candle in his hand,
and a smile upon his countenance, which was still partially red
from the effects of my petulance. I sulked and sobbed, and he
fondled and soothed; till I began to brighten. Goldsmith,
who, in regard to children, was like the village preacher he has
so beautifully described,&mdash;for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">'Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distressed,'&mdash;</span>
</div></div>

<p>seized the propitious moment of returning good-humour; so he
put down the candle, and began to conjure. He placed three
hats, which happened to be in the room, upon the carpet, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
shilling under each: the shillings he told me, were England,
France, and Spain. 'Hey, presto, cockolorum!' cried the
doctor,&mdash;and, lo! on uncovering the shillings which had been
dispersed, each beneath a separate hat, they were all found congregated
under one. I was no politician at five years old, and,
therefore, might not have wondered at the sudden revolution
which brought England, France, and Spain all under one
crown; but, as I was also no conjuror, it amazed me beyond
measure. Astonishment might have amounted to awe for one
who appeared to me gifted with the power of performing
miracles, if the good-nature of the man had not obviated my
dread of the magician; but, from that time, whenever the
doctor came to visit my father,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">'I pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile;</span>
</div></div>

<p>a game at romps constantly ensued, and we were always cordial
friends, and merry play-fellows.</p>

<p class="indent">"Foote's earliest notices of me were far from flattering;
but, though they had none of Goldsmith's tenderness, they had none
of Johnson's ferocity; and when he accosted me with his usual
salutation of 'Blow your nose, child!' there was a whimsical
manner, and a broad grin upon his features, which always made me laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">"His own nose was generally begrimed with snuff; and,
if he had never been more facetious than upon the subject of my
<i>emunctories</i>, which, by the bye, did not went cleansing, I need
not tell the reader, that he would not have been distinguished as
a wit;&mdash;he afterwards condescended to pass better jokes upon me.</p>

<p class="indent">"The paradoxical celebrity which he maintained upon the
stage was very singular; his satirical sketches were scarcely dramas,
and he could not be called a good legitimate performer. Yet
there is no Shakspeare or Roscius upon record who, like Foote,
supported a theatre for a series of years by his own acting, in
his own writings, and, for ten years of the time, upon a <i>wooden leg</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">The reader, if he have not seen these passages before,
will, we are sure, sympathise with us in our regrets that the work from
which we extract them, carries us only in its two volumes to the
year 1785,&mdash;a period at which Colman's fame and reputation
had yet to be made.</p>

<p class="indent">His first decidedly successful drama was "Inkle and
Yarico:" this at once established his character as an author. "Ways
and Means," "The Mountaineers," and "The Iron Chest" followed;
and in 1798 he published those admirable poems known
as "My Night-gown and Slippers." His greatest literary triumphs
were, however, yet to come. "The Heir at Law" was
his first regular comedy; and we doubt very much whether he
ever excelled it, or, indeed, if it has been excelled by more than
a very few plays in the English language. We know that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
theatrical world, and we believe the author himself, gave a decided
preference to "John Bull;" but we admit that as we are
unfashionable enough to prefer Sheridan's "Rivals" to his
"School for Scandal," so are we prepared unhesitatingly to declare
our opinion that "The Heir at Law" is Colman's <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Poor Gentleman" is an excellent play; and "Who
wants a Guinea?" although not so decidedly successful as its
predecessors, teems with that rich humour and quaintness of
thought which so strongly characterise the writing of its author.
His farces of "The Review," "Love laughs at Locksmiths,"
"We fly by Night," and several others, are all admirable
in their way. These were given to the town as the reductions
of Arthur Griffinhoofe, a <i>nom de guerre</i>, however, which proved
quite inefficient in making the public mistake the source whence
their amusement was derived.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1819, Mr. Colman finally retired from the
proprietorship and management of the Haymarket Theatre. Upon the escape
and flight from England of Captain Davis, the lieutenant of the
Yeoman Guard, his Majesty George the Fourth appointed Mr.
Colman to succeed him; and on the death of Mr. Larpent he
also received the appointment of Examiner of Plays. The former
office he relinquished in favour of Sir John Gete, some
three or four years since; and in the latter he has, as our readers
know, been succeeded by Mr. Charles Kemble.</p>

<p class="indent">It would be unjust and unfair to the memory of Mr.
Colman were we to let slip this opportunity of saying a few words upon
the subject of his conduct in the execution of the duties of this
situation; because it has been made the object of attack even
by men of the highest talent and reputation, as well as the low
ribald abuse of their literary inferiors,&mdash;which, however, considering
the source whence it came, is not worth noticing.</p>

<p class="indent">It has been alleged that Mr. Colman was unnecessarily
rigid in his exclusion of oaths and profane sayings from the dramatic
works submitted to his inspection; and the gist of the arguments
against him touching this rigour went to show that he ought
not to expunge such expressions as examiner, because he had
used such expressions himself as an author. This reasoning
is absurd, the conclusion inconsequential. When Mr. Colman
wrote plays, he was not bound by oath to regulate their language
by any fixed standard; and, as all other dramatists of
the day had done, in a dialogue or depicting a character
he used in some&mdash;perhaps all his dramas&mdash;occasional
expletives. But Mr. Colman's plays then had to be submitted
to an examiner, who, conscientiously, did his duty; and, from
the high moral character of the late licenser, there can be little
lesson for doubting that <i>he</i>, like his successor, drew his pen
across any expression which he might have considered objectionable;
but no one ever complained of this, because Mr. Larpent had
never written a play, or used an oath in its dialogues.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">When Mr. Colman assumed the legal and necessary power
of correction, he had but one course to pursue: he was sworn to
perform a certain duty assigned to him to the best of his judgment,
and to correct any expressions which he might consider
injurious to the state or to morality. What had <i>he</i> to do, as
licenser, with what he had himself done as author? The <i>tu
quoque</i> principle in this use is even more than usually absurd;
it is as if a schoolmaster were to be prevented from flogging a
boy for breaking windows, because, when he was a boy, he had
broken windows himself.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">As we have already stated that it is not our
intention to make these few pages a piece of biography, we shall leave to
some better qualified person to give the more minute details of Mr.
Colman's life. The following lines, written by himself, now
many years since, and when he himself was under fifty, give as
good an epitome of his career up to that period as fifty pages of
matter-of-fact; and from that time until the occurrence of the sad
event to which the last stanza, so pathetically&mdash;as it
<i>now</i> reads&mdash;refers, he lived on in happiness and comfort.</p>

<p class="indent">It is a curious coincidence&mdash;although considering the
proximity of their ages there may be nothing really strange in it&mdash;that
Mr. Colman and his intimate friend Bannister should have quitted
this mortal world so nearly at the same time. The circumstance,
however, gives us an opportunity of bringing their names
together in a manner honourable to both. We derive the anecdote
from the "Random Records;" and we think it will be at
this juncture favourably received by those who admire dramatic
authors and actors, and who rejoice to see traits of private
worth the concomitants of public excellence.</p>

<p class="indent">After recounting the circumstances of his first
acquaintance with Bannister, Mr. Colman says,</p>

<p class="indent">"In the year of my return from Aberdeen, 1784, unconscious
of fear through ignorance of danger, I rushed into early publicity
as an avowed dramatist. My father's illness in 1789 obliged
me to undertake the management of his theatre; which, having
purchased at his demise, I continued to manage as my own. During
such progression, up to the year 1796 inclusive, I scribbled
many dramas for the Haymarket, and one for Drury-lane; in
almost all of which the younger Bannister (being engaged at
both theatres) performed a prominent character; so that, for most
of the thirteen years I have enumerated, he was of the greatest
importance to my theatrical prosperity in my double capacity
of author and manager; while I was of some service to him by
supplying him with new characters. These reciprocal interests
made us, of course, such close colleagues, that our almost daily
consultations promoted amity, while they forwarded business.</p>

<p class="indent">"From this last-mentioned period, (1796,) we were led
by our speculations, one after the other, into different tracks. He had
arrived at that height of London popularity when his visits to
various provincial theatres in the summer were productive of
much more money than my scale of expense in the Haymarket
could afford to give him. As he wintered it, however, in
Drury-lane, I profited for two years more by his acting in the
pieces which I produced there. I then began to write for the
rival house in Covent Garden, and this parted us as author and
actor: but separating, as we did, through accident, and with the
kindest sentiments for each other, it was not likely that we should
forget or neglect further to cultivate our mutual regard: that
regard is now so mellowed by time that it will never cease till
Time himself,&mdash;who, in ripening our friendship, has been all the
while whetting his scythe for the friends,&mdash;shall have mowed
down the men, and gathered in his harvest.</p>

<p class="indent">"One trait of Bannister, in our worldly dealings with
each other, will nearly bring me to the close of this chapter.</p>

<p class="indent">"In the year 1807, after having slaved at some dramatic
composition,&mdash;I forget what,&mdash;I had resolved to pass one entire
week in luxurious sloth.</p>

<p class="indent">"At this crisis,&mdash;just as I was beginning the first morning's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
sacrifice upon the altar of my darling goddess, Indolence,&mdash;enter
Jack Bannister, with a huge manuscript under his left arm!&mdash;This,
he told me, consisted of loose materials for an entertainment,
with which he meant to "skirr the country," under the
title of <span class="smcap">Bannister's Budget</span>;
but, unless I reduced the chaos into some order for him,
and that <i>instantly</i>,&mdash;he should lose his
tide, and with it his emoluments for the season. In such a case
there was no balancing between two alternatives, so I deserted
my darling goddess to drudge through the week for my old companion.</p>

<p class="indent">"To concoct the crudities he had brought me, by polishing,
expunging, adding,&mdash;in short, almost re-writing them,&mdash;was, it
must be confessed, labouring under the "horrors of digestion;"
but the toil was completed at the week's end, and away went
Jack Bannister into the country with his <span class="smcap">Budget</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">"Several months afterwards he returned to town; and I
inquired, of course, what success?&mdash;So great, he answered, that
in consequence of the gain which had accrued to him through
my means, and which he was certain would still accrue, (as he
now considered the Budget to be an annual income for some
years to come,) he must insist upon cancelling a bond which
I had given him, for money he had lent to me. I was astounded;
for I had never dreamt of fee or reward.</p>

<p class="indent">"To prove that he was in earnest, I extract a paragraph
from a latter which he wrote to me from Shrewsbury.</p>

<p class="blockquot">&emsp;"'For fear of accidents, I think it necessary to inform
you that Fladgate, your attorney, is in possession of your bond to
me of £700; as I consider it <i>fully discharged</i>, it is but proper
you should have this acknowledgment under my hand.&emsp;&emsp;J.B.'</p>

<p class="indent">"Should my unostentatious friend think me indelicate in
publishing this anecdote, I can only say, that it naturally appertains
to the sketch I have given of our co-operations in life; and that
the insertion of it here seems almost indispensable, in order to
elucidate my previous statement of our having blended so much
<i>sentiment</i> with so much <i>traffic</i>. I feel, too, that it would
be downright injustice to him if I suppressed it; and would betoken
in myself the pride of those narrow-minded persons who
are ashamed of acknowledging how greatly they have profited
by the liberal spirit of others.</p>

<p class="indent">"The bond above mentioned was given, be it observed, on
a private account; not for money due to an actor for his professional
assistance. Gilliland, in his 'Dramatic Mirror,' says that
my admission of partners 'enabled the proprietors to completely
liquidate all the demands which had for some time past involved
the house in temporary embarrassments.' This is a gross mistake;
the Haymarket Theatre was <i>never</i> embarrassed (on the
contrary, it was a prosperous speculation) while under my direction.
My own difficulties during part of this time are another
matter: I may touch <i>slightly</i> on this hereafter; but shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
not bore my readers by dwelling long on matters which (however
they may have annoyed <i>me</i>) cannot entertain or interest <i>them</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">"I regret following up one instance of Mr. Gilliland's
inaccuracy immediately with another; but he asserts, in his 'Dramatic
Mirror,' that J. Bannister, 'in the season 1778, made his appearance
for the benefit of his father, <i>on the boards of Old Drury</i>.'
In contradiction to the foregoing statement a document
now lies before me,&mdash;I transcribe it verbatim:</p>

<p class="indent">"'First appearance, <i>at the Haymarket</i>, for my
father's benefit, 1778, in The Apprentice. First appearance at Drury-lane,
1779, in Zaphna, in Mahomet. Took leave of the stage at
Drury-lane, Thursday, June 1st, 1815. Garrick instructed me
in the four first parts I played,&mdash;the Apprentice; Zaphna
(Mahomet); Dorilas (Merope); and Achmet (Barbarossa).&mdash;Jack
Bannister, to his dear friend George Colman. June 30th, 1828.'"</p>

<p class="indent">These memoranda, under the circumstances, are curious and
affecting.&mdash;Death <i>has</i> gathered in his harvest, and both the
men <i>are</i> gone.</p>

<p class="indent">Of Mr. Colman's delightful manners and conversational
powers no words can give any adequate idea: with all the advantages
of extensive reading, a general knowledge of mankind, and an
inexhaustible fund of wit and humour, he blended a joyousness
of expression, a kindness of feeling, and a warmth of manner,
which rendered him the much-sought companion of every
circle of society in which he chose to mix. Of his literary
talents all the world can judge; but it is only those who have
known him in private life who can appreciate the qualities which
we despair of being able justly to describe.</p>

<h2>HANDY ANDY.</h2>

<p class="indent">Andy Rooney was a fellow who had the most singularly
ingenious knack of doing every thing the wrong way; disappointment
awaited on all affairs in which he bore a part, and destruction
was at his fingers' ends: so the nick-name the neighbours
stuck upon him was Handy Andy, and the jeering jingle pleased them.</p>

<p class="indent">Andy's entrance into this world was quite in character
with his after achievements, for he was nearly the death of his mother.
She survived, however, to have herself clawed almost to death
while her darling babby was in arms, for he would not take his
nourishment from the parent fount unless he had one of his little
red fists twisted into his mother's hair, which he dragged till he
made her roar; while he diverted the pain by scratching her till
the blood came, with the other. Nevertheless she swore he was
"the loveliest and sweetest craythur the sun ever shined upon;"
and when he was able to run about and wield a little stick, and
smash every thing breakable belonging to her, she only praised
his precocious powers, and used to ask, "Did ever any one see
a darlin' of his age handle a stick so bowld as he did?"</p>

<p class="indent">Andy grew up in mischief and the admiration of his
mammy; but, to do him justice, he never meant harm in the course of his
life, and was most anxious to offer his services on all occasions
to any one who would accept them; but they were only those
who had not already proved Andy's peculiar powers.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a farmer hard by in this happy state of
ignorance, named Owen Doyle, or, as he was familiarly called, <i>Owny
na Coppal</i>, or, "Owen of the Horses," because he bred many of
these animals, and sold them at the neighbouring fairs; and
Andy one day offered his services to Owny when he was in want
of some one to drive up a horse to his house from a distant
"bottom," as low grounds by a river side are always called in
Ireland.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, he's wild, Andy, and you'd never be able to ketch
him," said Owny.&mdash;"Throth, an' I'll engage I'll ketch him if
you'll let me go. I never seen the horse I couldn't ketch, sir,"
said Andy.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, you little spridhogue, if he took to runnin' over
the long bottom, it 'ud be more than a day's work for you to folly
him."&mdash;"Oh, but he won't run."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why won't he run?"&mdash;"Bekase I won't make him run."</p>

<p class="indent">"How can you help it?"&mdash;"I'll soother him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, you're a willin' brat, any how; and so go, and God
speed you!" said Owny.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">"Just gi' me a wisp o' hay an' a han'ful iv oats," said Andy,
"if I should have to coax him."&mdash;"Sartinly," said Owny, who
entered the stable and came forth with the articles required by
Andy, and a halter for the horse also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Now, take care," said Owny, "that you're able to ride
that horse if you get on him."&mdash;"Oh, never fear, sir. I can ride
owld Lanty Gubbin's mule betther nor any o' the other boys
on the common, and he couldn't throw me th' other day, though
he kicked the shoes av him."</p>

<p class="indent">"After that you may ride any thing," said Owny: and
indeed it was true; for Lanty's mule, which fed on the common,
being ridden slily by all the young vagabonds in the neighbourhood,
had become such an adept in the art of getting rid of his
troublesome customers, that it might be well considered a feat
to stick on him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, take grate care of him, Andy, my boy," said the
farmer.&mdash;"Don't be afeard sir," said Andy, who started on his
errand in that peculiar pace which is elegantly called a "sweep's
trot;" and as the river lay between Owny Doyle's and the bottom,
and was too deep for Andy to ford at that season, he went
round by Dinny Dowling's mill, where a small wooden bridge
crossed the stream.</p>

<p class="indent">Here he thought he might as well secure the assistance
of Paudeen, the miller's son, to help him in catching the horse;
an he looked about the place until he found him, and, telling
him the errand on which he was going, said, "If you like to
come wid me, we can both have a ride." This was temptation
sufficient for Paudeen, and the boys proceeded together to the
bottom, and they were not long in securing the horse. When
they had got the halter over his head, "Now," said Andy,
"give me a lift on him;" and accordingly by Paudeen's catching
Andy's left foot in both his hands clasped together in the
fashion of a stirrup, he hoisted his friend on the horse's back;
and, as soon as he was secure there, Master Paudeen, by the aid
of Andy's hand contrived to scramble up after him; upon which
Andy applied his heels into the horse's side with many vigorous
kicks, and crying "Hurrup!" at the same time, endeavoured to
stimulate Owny's steed into something of a pace as he turned
his head towards the mill.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sure aren't you going to crass the river?" said
Paudeen.&mdash;"No, I'm going to lave you at home."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I'd rather go up to Owny's, and it's the shortest
way acrass the river."&mdash;"Yes but I don't like&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it afeard you are?" said Paudeen.&mdash;"Not I,
indeed," said Andy; though it was really the fact, for the width of the
stream startled him; "but Owny towld me to take grate care
o' the baste and I'm loath to wet his feet."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go 'long wid you, you fool! what harm would it do him?
Sure he's neither sugar nor salt that he'd melt."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, I won't, any how," said Andy, who by this time
had got the horse into a good high trot, that shook every word of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
argument out of Paudeen's body; besides, it was as much as
the boys could do to keep their seats on Owny's Bucephalus,
who was not long in reaching the miller's bridge. Here voice
and rein were employed to pull him in, that he might cross the
narrow wooden structure at a quiet pace. But whether his
double load had given him the idea of double exertion, or that
the pair of legs on each side sticking into his flanks (and perhaps
the horse was ticklish) made him go the faster, we know not:
but the horse charged the bridge as if an Enniskilliner were on
his back, and an enemy before him; and in two minutes his
hoofs cluttered like thunder on the bridge, that did not bend
beneath him. No, it did <i>not</i> bend, but it broke: proving the
falsehood of the boast, "I may break, but I won't bend:" for,
after all, the really strong may bend, and be as strong as ever:
it is the unsound, that has only the seeming of strength, that
breaks at last when it resists too long.</p>

<p class="indent">Surprising was the spin the young equestrians took over
the ears of the horse, enough to make all the artists of Astley's
envious; and plump they went into the river, where each formed
his own ring, and executed some comical "scenes in the circle,"
which were suddenly changed to evolutions on the "flying cord"
that Dinny Dowling threw the performers, which became suddenly
converted into a "tight rope" as he dragged the <i>voltigeurs</i>
out of the water; and, for fear their blood might be chilled by
the accident, he gave them both an enormous thrashing with the
<i>dry</i> end of the rope, just to restore circulation; and his
exertions, had they been witnessed, would have charmed the
Humane Society.</p>

<p class="indent">As for the horse, his legs stuck through the bridge, as
though he had been put in a <i>chiroplast</i>, and he went playing away on
the water with considerable execution, as if he were accompanying
himself in the song which he was squealing at the top of his
voice. Half the saws, hatchets, ropes, and poles in the parish
were put in requisition immediately; and the horse's first lesson
in <i>chiroplastic</i> exercise was performed with no other loss than
some skin and a good deal of hair. Of course Andy did not
venture on taking Owny's horse home; so the miller sent him to
his owner with an account of the accident. Andy for years
kept out of Owny na Coppal's way; and at any time that his
presence was troublesome, the inconvenienced party had only to
say, "Isn't that Owny na Coppal coming this way?" and Andy
fled for his life,</p>

<p class="indent">When Andy grew up to what in country parlance is
called "a brave lump of a boy," his mother thought he was old enough
to do something for himself; so she took him one day along
with her to the squire's, and waited outside the door, loitering up
and down the yard behind the house, among a crowd of beggars
and great lazy dogs that were thrusting their herds into every
iron pot that stood outside the kitchen door, until chance might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
give her "a sight o' the squire afore he wint out or afore he
wint in;" and, after spending her entire day in this idle way, at
last the squire made his appearance, and Judy presented her
son, who kept scraping his foot, and pulling his forelock, that
stuck out like a piece of ragged thatch from his forehead, making
his obeisance to the squire, while his mother was sounding
his praises for being the "handiest craythur alive&mdash;and so
willin'&mdash;nothing comes wrong to him."</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose the English of all this is, you want me to
take him?" said the squire.&mdash;"Throth, an' your honour, that's just
it&mdash;if your honour would be plazed."</p>

<p class="indent">"What can he do?"&mdash;"Anything, your honour."</p>

<p class="indent">"That means <i>nothing</i>, I suppose," said the squire.&mdash;"Oh,
no, sir. Everything, I mane, that you would desire him to do."</p>

<p class="indent">To every one of these assurances on his mother's part Andy
made a bow and a scrape.</p>

<p class="indent">"Can he take care of horses?"&mdash;"The best of care, sir,"
said the mother, while the miller, who was standing behind the squire
waiting for orders, made a grimace at Andy, who was obliged
to cram his face to his hat to hide the laugh, which he could
hardly smother from being heard, as well as seen.</p>

<p class="indent">"Let him come, then, and help in the stables, and we'll see
what he can do."&mdash;"May the Lord&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"That'll do&mdash;there, now go."&mdash;"Oh, sure, but I'll pray
for you, and&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you go?"&mdash;"And may angels make your honour's bed
this blessed night, I pray!"</p>

<p class="indent">"If you don't go, your son shan't come."</p>

<p class="indent">Judy and her hopeful boy turned to the right-about in double-quick
time, and hurried down the avenue.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day Andy was duly installed into his office of
stable-helper; and, as he was a good rider, he was soon made
whipper-in to the hounds, as there was a want of such a functionary
in the establishment; and Andy's boldness in this capacity
made him soon a favourite with the squire, who was one
of those rollicking boys on the pattern of the old school, who
scorned the attentions of a regular valet, and let any one that
chance threw in his way bring him his boots, or his hot water
for shaving, or his coat, whenever it <i>was</i> brushed. One morning,
Andy, who was very often the attendant on such occasions,
came to his room with hot water. He tapped at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">"Who's that?" said the squire, who was but just risen, and
did not know but it might be one of the women servants.&mdash;"It's me, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh&mdash;Andy! Come in."&mdash;"Here's the hot wather, sir,"
said Andy, bearing an enormous tin can.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, what the d&mdash;l brings that tin can here? You might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
as well bring the stable-bucket."&mdash;"I beg your pardon, sir,"
said Andy retreating. In two minutes more Andy came back,
and, tapping at the door, put in his head cautiously, and said,
"The maids in the kitchen, your honour, says there's not so
much hot wather ready."</p>

<p class="indent">"Did I not see it a moment since in your hands?"&mdash;"Yes,
sir, but that's not nigh the full o' the stable-bucket."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go along, you stupid thief! and get me some hot water
directly."&mdash;"Will the can do, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, anything, so you make haste."</p>

<p class="indent">Off posted Andy, and back he came with the can.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where'll I put it, sir?"&mdash;"Throw this out," said the
squire, handing Andy a jug containing some cold water, meaning
the jug to be replenished with the hot.</p>

<p class="indent">Andy took the jug, and, the window of the room being open,
he very deliberately threw the jug out. The squire stared with
wonder, and at last said,</p>

<p class="indent">"What did you do that for?"&mdash;"Sure you <i>towld</i>
me to throw it out, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go out of this, you thick-headed villain!" said the
squire, throwing his boots at Andy's head, along with some very neat
curses. Andy retreated, and thought himself a very ill-used person.</p>

<p class="indent">Though Andy's regular business was "whipper-in," yet
he was liable to be called on for the performance of various other
duties: he sometimes attended at table when the number of
guests required that all the subs should be put in requisition,
or rode on some distant errand for "the mistress," or drove
out the nurse and children on the jaunting-car; and many were
the mistakes, delays, or accidents arising from Handy Andy's
interference in such matters; but, as they were never serious,
and generally laughable, they never cost him the loss of his
place or the squire's favour, who rather enjoyed Andy's blunders.</p>

<p class="indent">The first time Andy was admitted into the mysteries
of the dining-room, great was his wonder. The butler took him in to
give him some previous instructions, and Andy was so lost in
admiration at the sight of the assembled glass and plate, that
he stood with his mouth and eyes wide open, and scarcely heard
a word that was said to him. After the head-man had been
dinning his instructions into him for some time, he said he
might go until his attendance was required. But Andy moved
not; he stood with his eyes fixed by a sort of fascination on
some object that seemed to rivet them with the same unaccountable
influence that the snake exercises over its victim.</p>

<p class="indent">"What are you looking at?" said the butler.&mdash;"Them
things, sir," said Andy, pointing to some silver forks.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it the forks?" said the butler.&mdash;"Oh no, sir!
I know what forks is very well; but I never seen them things afore."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"What things do you mean?"&mdash;"These things, sir,"
said Andy, taking up one of the silver forks, and turning it round
and round in his hand in utter astonishment, while the butler
grinned at his ignorance, and enjoyed his own superior knowledge.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well!" said Andy, after a long pause, "the divil be from
me if ever I seen a silver spoon split that way before."</p>

<p class="indent">The butler laughed a horse-laugh, and made a standing
joke of Andy's split spoon; but time and experience made Andy
less impressed with wonder at the show of plate and glass, and
the split spoons became familiar as 'household words' to him;
yet still there were things in the duties of table attendance beyond
Andy's comprehension,&mdash;he used to hand cold plates for
fish, and hot plates for jelly, &amp;c. But 'one day,' as Zanga says,&mdash;'one
day' he was thrown off his centre in a remarkable degree
by a bottle of soda water.</p>

<p class="indent">It was when that combustible was first introduced into
Ireland as a dinner beverage that the occurrence took place, and
Andy had the luck to be the person to whom a gentlemen applied
for some soda-water.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sir?" said Andy.&mdash;"Soda-water," said the guest,
in that subdued tone in which people are apt to name their wants at a
dinner-table.</p>

<p class="indent">Andy went to the butler. "Mr. Morgan, there's a
gintleman&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Let me alone, will you?" said Mr. Morgan.</p>

<p class="indent">Andy man&oelig;uvred round him a little longer, and again
essayed to be heard.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Morgan!"&mdash;"Don't you see I'm as busy as I can be!
Can't you do it yourself?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I dunna what he wants."&mdash;"Well, go and ax him," said
Mr. Morgan.</p>

<p class="indent">Andy went off as he was bidden, and came behind the thirsty
gentleman's chair, with "I beg your pardon sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well!" said the gentleman.</p>

<p class="indent">"I beg your pardon, sir; but what's this you ax'd me
for?"&mdash;"Soda-water."</p>

<p class="indent">"What, sir?"&mdash;"Soda-water; but, perhaps, you have not
any."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, there's plenty in the house, sir! Would you like it
hot, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">The gentleman laughed, and, supposing the new fashion was
not understood in the present company, said "Never mind."</p>

<p class="indent">But Andy was too anxious to please, to be so satisfied, and
again applied to Mr. Morgan.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sir!" said he.&mdash;"Bad luck to you! can't you let me alone?"</p>

<p class="indent">"There's a gintleman wants some soap and wather."</p>

<p class="indent">"Some what?"&mdash;"Soap and wather, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Divil sweep you!&mdash;Soda-wather you mane. You'll get it
under the sideboard."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Is it in the can, sir?"&mdash;"The curse o' Crum'll on
you&mdash;in the bottles."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is this it, sir?" said Andy, producing a bottle of ale.&mdash;"No,
bad cess to you!&mdash;the little bottles."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it the little bottles with no bottoms, sir?"&mdash;"I
wish <i>you</i> wor in the bottom o' the say!" said Mr. Morgan, who was fuming
and puffing, and rubbing down his face with his napkin, as
he was hurrying to all quarters of the room, or, as Andy said,
in praising his activity, that he was "like bad luck,&mdash;everywhere."</p>

<p class="indent">"There they are!" said Morgan, at last.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! them bottles that won't stand," said Andy; "sure,
them's what I said, with no bottoms to them. How'll I open
it&mdash;it's tied down?"&mdash;"Cut the cord, you fool!"</p>

<p class="indent">Andy did as he was desired; and he happened at the
time to hold the bottle of soda-water on a level with the candles that
shed light over the festive board from a large silver branch, and
the moment he made the incision, bang went the bottle of soda,
knocking out two of the lights with the projected cork, which,
performing its parabola the length of the room, struck the squire
himself in the eye at the foot of the table, while the hostess at
the head had a cold-bath down her back. Andy, when he saw
the soda-water jumping out of the bottle, held it from him at
arm's length; every fizz it made, exclaiming, "Ow!&mdash;ow!&mdash;ow!"
and, at last, when the bottle was empty, he roared out,
"Oh, Lord!&mdash;it's all gone!"</p>

<p class="indent">Great was the commotion;&mdash;few could resist laughter
except the ladies, who all looked at their gowns, not liking the mixture
of satin and soda-water. The extinguished candles were relighted,&mdash;the
squire got his eye open again,&mdash;and, the next time
he perceived the butler sufficiently near to speak to him, he said,
in a low and hurried tone of deep anger, while he knit his brow,
"Send that fellow out of the room!" but, within the same instant,
resumed the former smile, that beamed on all around as if
nothing had happened.</p>

<p class="indent">Andy was expelled the <i>salle à manger</i> in disgrace,
and for days kept out of his master's and mistress's way: in the mean
time the butler made a good story of the thing in the servants'
hall; and, when he held up Andy's ignorance to ridicule, by
telling how he asked for "soap and water," Andy was given
the name of "Suds," and was called by no other, for months after.</p>

<p class="indent">But, though Andy's function in the interior were suspended,
his services in out-of-door affairs were occasionally put in requisition.
But here his evil genius still haunted him, and he put
his foot in a piece of business his master sent him upon one day,
which was so simple as to defy almost the chance of Andy
making any mistake about it; but Andy was very ingenious in
his own particular line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Ride into the town, and see if there's a letter for me,"
said the squire, one day, to our hero.&mdash;"Yis, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"You know where to go?"&mdash;"To the town, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"But do you know where to go in the town?"&mdash;"No, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"And why don't you ask, you stupid thief?"&mdash;"Sure, I'd
find out, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Didn't I often tell you to ask what you're to do, when you
don't know?"&mdash;"Yis, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"And why don't you?"&mdash;"I don't like to be throublesome, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Confound you!" said the squire; though he could not help
laughing at Andy's excuse for remaining in ignorance.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," continued he, "go to the post-office. You know the
post-office, I suppose?"&mdash;"Yis, sir; where they sell gunpowdher."</p>

<p class="indent">"You're right for once," said the squire; for his Majesty's
postmaster was the person who had the privilege of dealing
in the aforesaid combustible. "Go then to the post-office,
and ask for a letter for me. Remember,&mdash;not gunpowder, but
a letter."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yis, sir," said Andy, who got astride of his hack, and
trotted away to the post-office. On arriving at the shop of the postmaster,
(for that person carried on a brisk trade in groceries,
gimlets, broad-cloth, and linen-drapery,) Andy presented himself
at the counter, and said,</p>

<p class="indent">"I want a letther, sir, if you plase."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who do you want it for?" said the postmaster, in a
tone which Andy considered an aggression upon the sacredness of
private life: so Andy thought the coolest contempt he could
throw upon the prying impertinence of the postmaster was to repeat
his question.</p>

<p class="indent">"I want a letther, sir, if you plase."</p>

<p class="indent">"And who do you want it for?" repeated the postmaster.</p>

<p class="indent">"What's that to you?" said Andy.</p>

<p class="indent">The postmaster, laughing at his simplicity, told him he could
not tell what letter to give him unless he told him the direction.</p>

<p class="indent">"The directions I got was to get a letther here,&mdash;that's the
directions."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who gave you those directions?"&mdash;"The masther."</p>

<p class="indent">"And who's your master?"&mdash;"What consarn is that o' yours?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, you stupid rascal! if you don't tell me his name,
how can I give you a letter?"&mdash;"You could give it if you
liked; but you're fond of axin' impidint questions, bekase you
think I'm simple."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go along out o' this. Your master must be as great a
goose as yourself to send such a messenger."&mdash;"Bad luck to
your impidince!" said Andy; "is it Squire Egan you dar to
say goose to?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Squire Egan's your master, then?"&mdash;"Yis; have you
anything to say agin it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Only that I never saw you before."&mdash;"Faith, then you'll
never see me agin if I have my own consint."</p>

<p class="indent">"I won't give you any letter for the squire, unless I know
you're his servant. Is there any one in the town knows
you?"&mdash;"Plenty," said Andy; "it's not every one is as ignorant
as you."</p>

<p class="indent">Just at this moment a person entered the house to get a
letter, to whom Andy was known; and he vouched to the postmaster
that the account he gave of himself was true.&mdash;"You may give
him the squire's letter. Have you one for me?"&mdash;"Yes, sir,"
said the postmaster, producing one: "fourpence."</p>

<p class="indent">The new-comer paid the fourpence postage, and left the
shop with his letter.</p>

<p class="indent">"Here's a letter for the squire," said the postmaster.
"You've to pay me elevenpence postage."</p>

<p class="indent">"What 'ud I pay elevenpence for?"&mdash;"For postage."</p>

<p class="indent">"To the divil wid you! Didn't I see you give Mr. Delany
a letther for fourpence this minit, and a bigger letther than
this; and now you want me to pay elevenpence for this scrap of
a thing. Do you think I'm a fool?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No; but I'm sure of it," said the postmaster.&mdash;"Well,
you're welkim to think what you plase; but don't be delayin'
me now; here's fourpence for you, and gi' me the letther."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go along, you stupid thief!" said the postmaster, taking up
the letter, and going to serve a customer with a mousetrap.</p>

<p class="indent">While this person and many others were served, Andy
lounged up and down the shop, every now and then putting in his
head in the middle of the customers, and saying, "Will you gi'
me the letther?"</p>

<p class="indent">He waited for above half an hour, in defiance of the
anathemas of the postmaster, and at last left, when he found it impossible
to get the common justice for his master which he thought
he deserved as well as another man; for, under this impression,
Andy determined to give no more than the fourpence.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire in the mean time was getting impatient for his
return, and, when Andy made his appearance, asked if there was a
letter for him.&mdash;"There is, sir," said Andy.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then give it to me."&mdash;"I haven't it, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean?"&mdash;"He wouldn't give it to me, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who wouldn't give it to you?"&mdash;"That owld chate beyant
in the town,&mdash;wanting to charge double for it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Maybe it's a double letter. Why the devil didn't you pay
what he asked, sir?"&mdash;"Arrah, sir, why would I let you be
chated. It's not a double letther at all: not above half the
size o' one Mr. Delany got before my face for fourpence."</p>

<p class="indent">"You'll provoke me to break your neck some day, you
vagabond! Ride back for your life, you omadhaun! and pay whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
he asks, and get me the letter."&mdash;"Why, sir, I tell you he
was sellin' them before my face for fourpence a-piece."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go back, you scoundrel! or I'll horsewhip you; and if you're
longer than an hour, I'll have you ducked in the horse-pond!"</p>

<p class="indent">Andy vanished, and made a second visit to the post-office.
When he arrived, two other persons were getting letters, and the
postmaster was selecting the epistles for each, from a parcel of
them that lay before him on the counter; at the same time many
shop customers were waiting to be served.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm for that letther," said Andy.&mdash;"I'll attend to
you by-and-by."</p>

<p class="indent">"The masther's in a hurry."&mdash;"Let him wait till
his hurry's over."</p>

<p class="indent">"He'll murther me if I'm not back soon."&mdash;"I'm glad to
hear it."</p>

<p class="indent">While the postmaster went on with such provoking answers
to these appeals for despatch, Andy's eye caught the heap of
letters that lay on the counter; so, while certain weighing of
soap and tobacco was going forward, he contrived to become
possessed of two letters from the heap; and, having effected
that, waited patiently enough until it was the great man's pleasure
to give him the missive directed to his master.</p>

<p class="indent">Then did Andy bestride his hack, and, in triumph at his
trick on the postmaster, rattle along the road homeward as fast as his
hack could carry him. He came into the squire's presence, his
face beaming with delight, and an air of self-satisfied superiority
in his manner, quite unaccountable to his master, until he pulled
forth his hand, which had been grubbing up his prizes from
the bottom of his pocket; and holding three letters over his head,
while he said "Look at that!" he next slapped them down
under his broad fist on the table before the squire, saying,</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">"Well! if he did make me pay elevenpence, by gor, I brought
your honour the worth o' your money, any how!"</p>

<span class="i6">Old Farmer Wall, of Manor Hall,</span>
<span class="i8">To market drove his wain:</span>
<span class="i6">Along the road it went well stowed</span>
<span class="i8">With sacks of golden grain.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">His station he took, but in vain did he look</span>
<span class="i8">For a customer all the morn;</span>
<span class="i6">Though the farmers all, save Farmer Wall,</span>
<span class="i8">They sold off all their corn.</span>

<span class="i6">Then home he went sore discontent,</span>

<span class="i8">When they met him at the door.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Next market-day, he drove away</span>
<span class="i8">To the town his loaded wain:</span>
<span class="i6">The farmers all, save Farmer Wall,</span>
<span class="i8">They sold off all their grain.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">No bidder he found, and he stood astound</span>
<span class="i8">At the close of the market-day,</span>
<span class="i6">When the market was done, and the chapmen were gone</span>
<span class="i8">Each man his several way.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">He stalked by his load along the road;</span>
<span class="i8">His face with wrath was red:</span>
<span class="i6">His arms he tossed, like a goodman crossed</span>
<span class="i8">In seeking his daily bread.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">His face was red, and fierce was his tread,</span>
<span class="i8">And with lusty voice cried he:</span>
<span class="i6">"My corn I'll sell to the devil of hell,</span>
<span class="i8">If he'll my chapman be."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">These words he spoke just under an oak</span>
<span class="i8">Seven hundred winters old;</span>
<span class="i6">And he straight was aware of a man sitting there</span>
<span class="i8">On the roots and grassy mould.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The roots rose high o'er the green-sward dry,</span>
<span class="i8">And the grass around was green,</span>

<span class="i8">Where it seemed as fire had been.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">All scorched was the spot, as gipsy-pot</span>

<span class="i6">The grass was marred, the roots were charred,</span>
<span class="i8">And the ivy stems were bare.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The stranger up-sprung: to the farmer he flung</span>
<span class="i8">A loud and friendly hail,</span>
<span class="i6">And he said, "I see well, thou hast corn to sell,</span>
<span class="i8">And I'll buy it on the nail."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The twain in a trice agreed on the price;</span>
<span class="i8">The stranger his earnest paid,</span>
<span class="i6">And with horses and wain to come for the grain</span>
<span class="i8">His own appointment made.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The farmer cracked his whip, and tracked</span>
<span class="i8">His way right merrily on:</span>
<span class="i6">He struck up a song, as he trudged along,</span>
<span class="i8">For joy that his job was done.</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">His children fair he danced in the air;</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The faggots burned, the porkling turned</span>

<span class="i8">Of a passing ghostly friar.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">He twirled at the pin, he entered in,</span>
<span class="i8">He sate down at the board;</span>
<span class="i6">The pig he blessed, when he saw it well dressed,</span>
<span class="i8">And the humming ale out-poured.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The friar laughed, the friar quaffed,</span>
<span class="i8">He chirped like a bird in May;</span>
<span class="i6">The farmer told how his corn he had sold</span>
<span class="i8">As he journeyed home that day.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The friar he quaffed, but no longer he laughed,</span>
<span class="i8">He changed from red to pale:</span>
<span class="i6">"Oh, helpless elf! 'tis the fiend himself</span>
<span class="i8">To whom thou hast made thy sale!"</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The friar he quaffed, he took a deep draught;</span>

<span class="i8">To whom thou hast sold thy grain!"</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"And sure as the day, he'll fetch thee away,</span>

<span class="i6">If thou let him pay o'er one tester more</span>
<span class="i8">Than thy settled price in gold."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The farmer gave vent to a loud lament,</span>
<span class="i8">The wife to a long outcry;</span>
<span class="i6">Their relish for pig and ale was flown;</span>
<span class="i8">The friar alone picked every bone,</span>
<span class="i6">And drained the flagon dry.</span>

<span class="i8">Appeared, and the stranger's wain</span>
<span class="i6">Come to the hour, with six-horse power,</span>
<span class="i8">To fetch the purchased grain.</span>

<h2 class="space-above1">TERENCE O'SHAUGHNESSY'S FIRST ATTEMPT<br />TO GET MARRIED.</h2>
<p class="f110">BY THE AUTHOR OF "<b>STORIES OF WATERLOO</b>."</p>

<p class="indent">Yes&mdash;here I am, Terence O'Shaughnessy, an honest major of
foot, five feet eleven and a half, and forty-one, if I only live till Michaelmas.
Kicked upon the world before the down had blackened on my chin, Fortune
and I have been wrestling from the cradle;&mdash;and yet I had little
to tempt the jade's malevolence. The youngest son of an excellent
gentleman, who, with an ill-paid rental of twelve hundred pounds, kept
his wife in Bath, and his hounds in Tipperary, my patrimony would
have scarcely purchased tools for a highwayman, when in my tenth
year my father's sister sent for me to Roundwood; for, hearing that
I was regularly going to the devil, she had determined to redeem me,
if she could.</p>

<p class="indent">My aunt Honor was the widow of a captain of dragoons, who
got his quietus in the Low Countries some years before I saw the light.
His relict had, in compliment to the memory of her departed lord,
eschewed matrimony, and, like a Christian woman, devoted her few and
evil days to cards and religion. She was a true specimen of an Irish
dowager. Her means were small, her temper short. She was stiff
as a ramrod, and proud as a field-marshal. To her, my education and
future settlement in life were entirely confided, as one brief month
deprived me of both parents. My mother died in a state of insolvency,
greatly regretted by every body in Bath to whom she was indebted;
and before her disconsolate husband had time to overlook a moiety of
the card claims transmitted for his liquidation, he broke his neck in
attempting to leap the pound-wall of Oranmore, for a bet of a rump
and dozen. Of course he was waked, and buried like a gentleman,&mdash;every
thing sold off by the creditors&mdash;my brothers sent to school&mdash;and
I left to the tender mercy and sole management of the widow of
Captain O'Finn.</p>

<p class="indent">My aunt's guardianship continued seven years, and at the
expiration of that time I was weary of her thrall, and she tired of my tutelage.
I was now at an age when some walk of life must be selected and
pursued. For any honest avocation I had, as it was universally
admitted, neither abilities nor inclination. What was to be done?
and how was I to be disposed of? A short deliberation showed that
there was but one path for me to follow, and I was handed over to
that <i>refugium peccatorum</i>, the army, and placed as a volunteer
in a regiment just raised, with a promise from the colonel that I
should be promoted to the first ensigncy that became vacant.</p>

<p class="indent">Great was our mutual joy when Mrs. O'Finn and I were
about to part company. I took an affectionate leave of all my kindred and
acquaintances, and even, in the fulness of my heart, shook hands
with the schoolmaster, though in boyhood I had devoted him to the
infernal gods for his wanton barbarity. But my tenderest parting was
reserved for my next-door neighbour, the belle among the village
beauties, and presumptive heiress to the virtues and estates of
Quartermaster MacGawly.</p>

<p class="indent">Biddy MacGawly was a year younger than myself; and, to do
her <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
justice, a picture of health and comeliness. Lord! what an eye she
had!&mdash;and her leg! nothing but the gout would prevent a man from
following it, to the very end of Oxford-street. Biddy and I were next
neighbours&mdash;our houses joined&mdash;the gardens were only separated by
a low hedge, and by standing on an inverted flower-pot one could accomplish
a kiss across it easily. There was no harm in the thing&mdash;it was
merely for the fun of trying an experiment&mdash;and when a geranium
was damaged, we left the blame upon the cats.</p>

<p class="indent">Although there was a visiting acquaintance between the
retired quartermaster and the relict of the defunct dragoon, never had any
cordiality existed between the houses. My aunt O'Finn was so lofty
in all things appertaining to her consequence, as if she had been the
widow of a common-councilman; and Roger MacGawly, having scraped
together a good round sum, by the means quartermasters have made
money since the days of Julius Cæsar, was not inclined to admit any
inferiority on his part. Mrs. O'Finn could never imagine that any
circumstances could remove the barrier in dignity which stood between
the non-commissioned officer and the captain. While arguing on the
saw, that "a living ass is better than a dead lion," Roger contended
that he was as good a man as Captain O'Finn; he, Roger, being alive
and merry in the town of Ballinamore, while the departed commander
had been laid under a "counterpane of daisies" in some counterscarp
in the Low Countries. Biddy and I laughed at the feuds of our
superiors; and on the evening of a desperate blow-up, we met at
sunset in the garden&mdash;agreed that the old people were fools&mdash;and
resolved that nothing should interrupt our friendly relations. Of
course the treaty was ratified with a kiss, for I recollect that next
morning the cats were heavily censured for capsizing a box of mignonette.</p>

<p class="indent">No wonder then, that I parted from Biddy with regret. I sat
with her till we heard the quartermaster scrape his feet at the hall-door
on his return from his club, and kissing poor Biddy tenderly, as Roger
entered by the front, I levanted by the back-door. I fancied myself
desperately in love, and was actually dreaming of my dulcinea when
my aunt's maid called me before day, to prepare for the stage-couch
that was to convey me to my regiment in Dublin.</p>

<p class="indent">In a few weeks an ensigncy dropped in, and I got it. Time
slipped insensibly away&mdash;months became years&mdash;and three passed
before I revisited Ballinamore. I heard, at stated periods, from Mrs. O'Finn.
The letters were generally a detail of bad luck or bad health. For
the last quarter she had never marked honours&mdash;or for the last week
closed an eye with rheumatism and lumbago. Still, as these <i>jérémiades</i>
covered my small allowance, they were welcome as a lover's billet.
Of course, in these despatches the neighbours were duly mentioned,
and every calamity occurring since her "last," was faithfully chronicled.
The MacGawlys held a conspicuous place in my aunt's quarterly
notices. Biddy had got a new gown&mdash;or Biddy had got a new piano&mdash;but
since the dragoons had come to town there was no bearing her.
Young Hastings was never out of the house&mdash;she hoped it would end
well&mdash;but every body knew a light dragoon could have little respect
for the daughter of a quartermaster; and Mrs. O'Finn ended her
observations by hinting that if Roger went seldomer to his club, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Biddy more frequently to mass, why probably in the end it would be
better for both of them.</p>

<p class="indent">I re-entered the well-remembered street of Ballinamore late
in the evening, after an absence of three years. My aunt was on a visit,
and she had taken that as a convenient season for having her domicile
newly painted. I halted at the inn, and after dinner strolled over the
any to visit my quondam acquaintances, the MacGawlys.</p>

<p class="indent">If I had intended a surprise, my design would have been a
failure. The quartermaster's establishment were on the <i>qui vive</i>. The
fact was, that since the removal of the dragoons, Ballinamore had been
dull as ditch-water; the arrival of a stranger in a post-chaise, of course
had created a sensation in the place, and, before the driver had
unharnessed, the return of Lieutenant O'Shaughnessy was regularly
gazetted, and the MacGawlys, in anticipation of a visit, were ready
to receive me.</p>

<p class="indent">I knocked at the door, and a servant with a beefsteak collar
opened it. Had Roger mounted a livery? Ay&mdash;faith&mdash;there it was; and
I began to recollect that my aunt O'Finn had omened badly from the
first moment a squadron of the 18th lights had entered Ballinamore.</p>

<p class="indent">I found Roger in the hall. He shook my hand, swore it was
an agreeable surprise, ushered me into the dining-room, and called for
hot water and tumblers. We sat down. Deeply did he interest himself
in all that had befallen me&mdash;deeply regret the absence of my
honoured aunt&mdash;but I must not stay at the inn, I should be his guest;
and, to my astonishment, it was announced that the gentleman in the
red collar had been already despatched to transport my luggage to the
house. Excuses were idle. Roger's domicile was to be head-quarters;
and when I remembered my old flame, Biddy, I concluded that I
might for the short time I had to stay, be in a less agreeable
establishment than the honest quartermaster's.</p>

<p class="indent">I was mortified to hear that Biddy had been indisposed. It
was a bad cold, she had not been out for a month; but she would muffle herself
and meet me in the drawing-room. This, too, was unluckily a
night of great importance in the club. The new curate was to be balloted
for; Roger had proposed him; and, <i>ergo</i>, Roger, as a true man,
was bound to be present at the ceremony. The thing was readily
arranged. We finished a second tumbler, the quartermaster betook
himself to the King's Arms, and the lieutenant, meaning myself; to the
drawing-room of my old inamorata.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a visible change in Roger's domicile. The house
was newly papered; and, leaving the livery aside, there was a greet increase
of gentility throughout the whole establishment. Instead of
bounding to the presence by three stairs at a time, as I used to do in
lang syne, I was ceremoniously paraded to the lady's chamber by him
of the beefsteak collar; and there, reclining languidly on a sofa, and
wrapped in a voluminous shawl, Biddy MacGawly held out her hand
to welcome her old confederate.</p>

<p class="indent">"My darling Biddy!"&mdash;"My dear Terence!" and the usual
preliminaries were got over. I looked at my old flame&mdash;she was greatly
changed, and three years had wrought a marvellous alteration. I left
her a sprightly girl&mdash;she was now a woman&mdash;and decidedly a very
pretty one; although the rosiness of seventeen was gone, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
delicacy that almost indicated bad health had succeeded; "but,"
thought I, "it's all owing to the cold."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a guarded propriety in Biddy's bearing, that
appeared almost unnatural. The warm advances of old friendship were
repressed; and one who had mounted a flower-pot to kiss me across a
hedge, recoiled from any exhibition of our former tenderness. Well,
it was all as it should be. Then I was a boy, and now a man. Young
women cannot be too particular, and Biddy MacGawly rose higher in
my estimation.</p>

<p class="indent">Biddy was stouter than she promised to be, when we parted,
but the eye was as dark and lustrous, and the ankle as taper as when it
last had demolished a geranium. Gradually her reserve abated; old
feelings removed a constrained formality&mdash;we laughed and talked&mdash;ay&mdash;and
kissed as we had done formerly; and when the old quartermaster's
latch-key was heard unclosing the street-door, I found
myself admitting in confidence and a whisper, that "I would marry if
I could." What reply Biddy would have returned, I cannot tell, for
Roger summoned me to the parlour; and as her cold prevented her
from venturing down, she bade me an affectionate good-night. Of
course she kissed me at parting&mdash;and it was done as ardently and
innocently as if the hawthorn hedge divided us.</p>

<p class="indent">Roger had left his companions earlier than he usually did,
in order to honour me, his guest. The new butler paraded oysters, and down
we sat <i>tête-à-tête</i>. When supper was removed, and each had
fabricated a red-hot tumbler from the tea-kettle, the quartermaster
stretched his long legs across the hearth-rug, and with great apparent
solicitude inquired into all that had befallen me since I had assumed
the shoulder-knot and taken to the trade of war.</p>

<p class="indent">"Humph!"&mdash;he observed&mdash;"two steps in three years;
not bad considering there was neither money nor interest. D&mdash;it! I often
wish that Biddy was a boy. Never was such a time to purchase on.
More regiments to be raised, and promotion will be at a discount.
Sir Hugh Haughton married a stockbroker's widow with half a plum,
and paid in the two thousand I had lent him. Zounds! if Biddy
were a boy, and that money well applied, I would have her a regiment
in a twelvemonth."</p>

<p class="indent">"Phew!" I thought to myself. "I see what the old
fellow is driving at."</p>

<p class="indent">"There never would be such another opportunity," Roger
continued. "An increased force will produce an increased difficulty in
effecting it. Men will be worth their own weight in money; and
d&mdash; me, a fellow who could raise a few, might have any thing he
asked for."</p>

<p class="indent">I remarked that, with some influence and a good round
sum, recruits might still be found.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, easy enough, and not much money either, if one knew
how to go about the thing. Get two or three smart chaps; let them watch
fairs and patterns, mind their hits when the bumpkins got drunk, and
find out when fellows were hiding from a warrant. D&mdash;me, I would
raise a hundred, while you would say Jack Robinson. Pay a friendly
magistrate; attest the scoundrels before they were sober enough to
cry off, bundle them to the regiment next morning; and if a rascal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
ran away after the commanding officer passed a receipt for him, why
all the better, for you could relist him when he came home again."</p>

<p class="indent">I listened attentively, though in all this the cloven foot
appeared. The whole was the plan of a crimp; and, if Roger was not belied,
trafficking in "food for powder," had realized more of his wealth than
slop-shoes and short measure.</p>

<p class="indent">During the developement of his project for promotion, the
quartermaster and I had found it necessary to replenish frequently, and with
the third tumbler Roger came nearer to business.</p>

<p class="indent">"Often thought it a pity, and often said so in the club, that
a fine smashing fellow like you, Terence, had not the stuff to push you on.
What the devil signifies family, and blood, and all that balderdash.
There's your aunt, worthy woman; but sky-high about a dead captain.
D&mdash;me, all folly. Were I a young man, I'd get hold of some girl
with the wherewithal, and I would double-distance half the highfliers
for a colonelcy."</p>

<p class="indent">This was pretty significant&mdash;Roger had come to the
scratch, and there was no mistaking him. We separated for the night. I dreamed,
and in fancy was blessed with a wife, and honoured with a command.
Nothing could be more entrancing than my visions; and when the
quartermaster's <i>maître d'hôtel</i> roused me in the morning, I was engaged
in a friendly argument with my beloved Biddy, as to which of
his grandfathers our heir should be called after, and whether the
lovely babe should be christened Roderick or Roger.</p>

<p class="indent">Biddy was not at breakfast; the confounded cold still confined
her to her apartment; but she hoped to meet me at dinner, and I must
endure her absence until then, as I best could. Having engaged to
return at five, I walked out to visit my former acquaintances. From
all of them I received a warm welcome, and all exhibited some surprise
at hearing that I was domesticated with the quartermaster. I
comprehended the cause immediately. My aunt and Roger had probably
a fresh quarrel; but his delicacy had prevented him from communicating
it. This certainly increased my respect for the worthy
man, and made me estimate his hospitality the more highly. Still
there was an evident reserve touching the MacGawlys; and once or
twice, when dragoons were mentioned, I fancied I could detect a significant
look pass between the persons with whom I was conversing.</p>

<p class="indent">It was late when I had finished my calls; Roger had requested
me to be regular to time, and five was fast approaching. I turned my
steps towards his dwelling-place, when, at a corner of a street, I
suddenly encountered an old schoolfellow on horseback, and great
was our mutual delight at meeting so unexpectedly. We were both
hurried, however, and consequently our greeting was a short one.
After a few general questions and replies, we were on the point of
separating, when my friend pulled up.</p>

<p class="indent">"But where are you hanging out?" said Frederick Maunsell.
"I know your aunt is absent."&mdash;"I am at old MacGawly's."</p>

<p class="indent">"The devil you are! Of course you heard all about Biddy
and young Hastings!"&mdash;"Not a syllable. Tell it to me."</p>

<p class="indent">"I have not time&mdash;it's a long story; but come to breakfast,
and I'll give you all the particulars in the morning. Adieu!" He struck
the spurs to his horse, and cantered off, singing&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh! she loved a bold dragoon,</span>
<span class="i0">With his long sword, saddle, bridle."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">I was thunderstruck. "Confound the dragoon!" thought I,
"and his long sword, saddle, and bridle, into the bargain. Gad! I wish
Maunsell had told me what it was. Well&mdash;what, suppose I ask Biddy
herself?" I had half resolved that evening to have asked her a very
different question; but, 'faith! I determined now to make some inquiries
touching Cornet Hastings of the 13th, before Miss Biddy
MacGawly should be invited to become Mrs. O'Shaughnessy.</p>

<p class="indent">My host announced that dinner was quite ready, and I
found Biddy in the eating-room. She was prettily dressed, as an invalid
should be; and, notwithstanding her cold, looked remarkably handsome.
I should to a certainty have been over head and ears in love,
had not Maunsell's innuendo respecting the young dragoon operated
as a damper.</p>

<p class="indent">Dinner proceeded as dinners always do, and Roger was bent
on hospitality. I fancied that Biddy regarded me with some interest,
while momentarily I felt an increasing tenderness that would have
ended, I suppose, in a direct declaration, but for the monitory hint
which I had received from my old schoolfellow. I was dying to know
what Maunsell's allusion pointed at, and I casually threw out a feeler.</p>

<p class="indent">"And you are so dull, you say? Yes, Biddy, you must miss
the dragoons sadly. By the way, there was a friend of mine here. Did
you know Tom Hastings?"</p>

<p class="indent">I never saw an elderly gentleman and his daughter more
confused. Biddy blushed like a peony, and Roger seemed desperately bothered.
At last the quartermaster responded,</p>

<p class="indent">"Fact is&mdash;as a military man, showed the cavalry some
attention&mdash;constantly at the house&mdash;anxious to be
civil&mdash;helped them to make out forage&mdash;but d&mdash;d wild&mdash;obliged
to cut, and keep them at a distance."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, Maunsell hinted something of that."</p>

<p class="indent">I thought Biddy would have fainted, and Roger grew red
as the footman's collar.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pshaw! d&mdash;d gossiping chap that Maunsell. Young
Hastings&mdash;infernal hemp&mdash;used to ride with Biddy. Persuaded her
to get on a horse of his&mdash;ran away&mdash;threw her&mdash;confined
at this inn for a week&mdash;never admitted him to my house afterwards."</p>

<p class="indent">Oh! here was the whole mystery unravelled! No wonder Roger
was indignant, and that Biddy would redden at the recollection. It
was devilish unhandsome of Mr. Hastings; and I expressed my opinion
in a way that evidently pleased my host and his heiress, and
showed how much I disapproved of the conduct of that <i>roué</i> the
dragoon.</p>

<p class="indent">My fair friend rose to leave us. Her shawl caught in the
chair, and I was struck with the striking change a few years had effected in
my old playfellow. She was grown absolutely stout. I involuntarily
noticed it.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lord! Biddy, how fat you are grown!"</p>

<p class="indent">A deeper blush than even when I named that luckless dragoon,
flushed to her very brows at the observation, while the quartermaster
rather testily exclaimed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, she puts on her clothes as if they were tossed on
with a pitchfork, since she got this cold. D&mdash;it! Biddy. I say, tighten
yourself, woman! Tighten yourself, or I won't be plased!"</p>

<p class="indent">Well, here was a load of anxiety removed, and Maunsell's
mischievous innuendo satisfactorily explained away. Biddy was right in
resenting the carelessness that exposed her to ridicule and danger;
and it was a proper feeling in the old quartermaster to cut the man
who would mount his heiress on a break-neck horse. Gradually
we resumed the conversation of last night&mdash;there was the regiment,
if I chose to have it&mdash;and when Roger departed for the club, I
made up my mind, while ascending the stairs, to make a splice with
Biddy, and become Colonel O'Shaughnessy.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus determined, I need not particularise what passed
upon the sofa. My wooing was short, sharp, and decisive; and no affected
delicacy restrained Biddy from confessing that the flame was mutual.
My fears had been moonshine; my suspicions groundless. Biddy
had not valued the dragoon a brass button; and&mdash;poor soul!&mdash;she hid
her head upon my shoulder, and, in a soft whisper, acknowledged
that she never had cared a <i>traneeine</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for any body in the
wide world but myself!</p>

<p class="indent">It was a moment of exquisite delight. I told her of my
prospects, and mentioned the quartermaster's conversation. Biddy listened
with deep attention. She blushed&mdash;strove to speak&mdash;stopped&mdash;was
embarrassed. I pressed her to be courageous: and at last she
deposited her head upon my breast, and bashfully hinted that Roger
was old&mdash;avarice was the vice of age&mdash;he was fond of money&mdash;he
was hoarding it certainly for her; but still, it would be better that
my promotion should be secured. Roger had now the cash in his
own possession. If we were married without delay, it would be
transferred at once; whereas something that might appear to him
advantageous, might offer, and induce her father to invest it. But
she was really shocked at herself&mdash;such a proposition would appear
so indelicate; but still, a husband's interests were too dear to be
sacrificed to maiden timidity.</p>

<p class="indent">I never estimated Biddy's worth till now. She united the
foresight of a sage with the devotion of a woman. I would have been
insensible indeed, had I not testified my regard and admiration; and
Biddy was still resting on my shoulder, when the quartermaster's
latch-key announced his return from the club.</p>

<p class="indent">After supper I apprised Roger of my passion for his daughter,
and modestly admitted that I had found favour in her sight. He heard
my communication, and frankly confessed that I was a son-in-law he
most approved of. Emboldened by the favourable reception of my
suit, I ventured to hint at an early day, and pleaded "a short leave
between returns," for precipitancy. The quartermaster met me like
a man.</p>

<p class="indent">"When people wished to marry, why, delay was balderdash.
Matters could be quickly and quietly managed. His money was ready&mdash;no
bonds or post-obits&mdash;a clean thousand in hand, and another the moment
an opening to purchase a step should occur. No use in mincing
matters among friends. Mrs. O'Finn was an excellent woman:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
she was a true friend, and a good Catholic; but, d&mdash;&mdash; it, she had
old-world notions about family, and in pride the devil was a fool to her. If
she came home before the ceremony, there would be an endless fuss;
and Roger concluded by suggesting that we should be married the
next evening, and give my honoured aunt an agreeable surprise."</p>

<p class="indent">That was precisely what I wanted; and a happier man never pressed
a pillow than I, after my interesting colloquy with the quartermaster.</p>

<p class="indent">The last morning of my celibacy dawned. I met Roger only at the
breakfast table; for my beloved Biddy, between cold and virgin trepidation,
was <i>hors de combat</i>, and signified in a tender billet her intention
to keep her chamber, until the happy hour arrived that should unite us
in the silken bonds of Hymen. The quartermaster undertook to conduct
the nuptial preparations; a friend of his would perform the ceremony,
and the quieter the thing was done the better. After breakfast
he set out to complete all matrimonial arrangements, and I strolled
into the garden to ruminate on my approaching happiness, and bless
Heaven for the treasure I was destined to possess in Biddy MacGawly.</p>

<p class="indent">No place could have been more appropriately selected for tender
meditation. <i>There</i> was the conscious hedge, that had witnessed the
first kiss of love; ay, and for naught I knew to the contrary, the
identical flower-pot on which her sylphic form had rested; sylphic it
was no longer, for the slender girl had ripened into a stout and comely
gentlewoman; and she would be mine&mdash;mine that very evening.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! Terence," I said in an undertone, "few men at twenty-one
have drawn such a prize. A thousand pounds! ready cash&mdash;a regiment
in perspective&mdash;a wife in hand; and such a wife&mdash;young, artless,
tender, and attached. By everything matrimonial, you have the luck
of thousands!"</p>

<p class="indent">My soliloquy was interrupted by a noise on the other side
of the fence. I looked over. It was my aunt's maid; and great was our
mutual astonishment. Judy blessed herself;
as she ejaculated&mdash;"Holy Virgin! Master Terence, is that you?"</p>

<p class="indent">I satisfied her of my identity, and learned to my unspeakable
surprise that my aunt had returned unexpectedly, and that she had not
the remotest suspicion that her affectionate nephew, myself, was cantoned
within pistol-shot. Without consideration I hopped over the
hedge, and next minute was in the presence of my honoured protectress,
the relict of the departed captain.</p>

<p class="indent">"Blessed angels!" exclaimed Mrs. O'Finn, as she took me to her
arms, and favoured me with a kiss, in which there was more blackguard<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
than ambrosia. "Arrah! Terence, jewel; what the devil
drove ye here? Lord pardon me for mentioning him!"</p>

<p class="indent">"My duty, dear aunt. I am but a week landed from Jersey, and
could not rest till I got leave from the colonel to run down between
returns, and pay you a hurried visit. Lord! how well you look!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! then, Terence, jewel, it's hard for me to look well,
considering the way I have been fretted by the tenants, and afflicted with
the lumbago. Denis Clark&mdash;may the widow's curse follow him
wherever he goes!&mdash;bundled off to America with a neighbour's wife,
and a year and a half's rent along with her, the thief! And then,
since Holland tide, I have not had a day's health."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Well, from your looks I should never have supposed it.
But you were visiting at Meldrum Castle?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, faith, and a dear visit it was. Nothing but half-crown
whist, and unlimited brag. Lost seventeen points last Saturday night. It
was Sunday morning, Lord pardon us for playing! But what was that
to my luck yesterday evening! Bragged twice for large pools, with
red nines and black knaves; and Mrs. Cooney, both times, showed
natural aces! If ever woman sold herself, she has. The Lord stand
between us and evil! Well, Terence, you'll be expecting your
quarter's allowance. We'll make it out somehow&mdash;Heigh-ho! Between
bad cards and runaway tenants, I can't attend to my soul as
I ought, and Holy Week coming!"</p>

<p class="indent">I expressed due sympathy for her losses, and regretted
that her health, bodily and spiritual, was so indifferent.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have no good news for you, Terence," continued Mrs.
O'Finn. "Your brother Arthur is following your poor father's example, and
ruining himself with hounds and horses. He's a weak and wilful man,
and nothing can save him, I fear. Though he never treated me with
proper respect, I strove to patch up match between him and Miss
MacTeggart. Five thousand down upon the nail, and three hundred
a year, failing her mother. I asked her here on a visit, and, though he
had ridden past without calling on me, wrote him my plan, and invited
him to meet her. What do you think, Terence, was his reply? Why,
that Miss MacTeggart might go to Bath, for he would have no call to
my swivel-eyed customers. There was a return for my kindness! as
if a woman with five thousand <i>down</i>, and three hundred a year in
expectation, was required to look straight. Ah! Terence, I wish you
had been here. She went to Dublin, and was picked up in a fortnight."</p>

<p class="indent">Egad! here was an excellent opportunity to broach my own success.
There could be no harm in making the commander's widow a <i>confidante</i>;
and, after all, she had a claim upon me as my early protectress.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear aunt, I cannot be surprised at your indignation.
Arthur was a fool, and lost an opportunity that never may occur again. In
fact, my dear madam, I intended to have given you an agreeable
surprise. I&mdash;I&mdash;I am on&mdash;the very brink of matrimony!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Holy Bridget!" exclaimed Mrs. O'Finn, as she crossed
herself devoutly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, ma'am. I am engaged to a lady with two thousand pounds."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it <i>ready</i>, Terence?" said my aunt.&mdash;"Down on the table,
before the priest puts on his vestment."</p>

<p class="indent">"Arrah&mdash;my blessing attend ye, Terence. I knew you would come
to good. Is she young?"&mdash;"Just twenty."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is she good-looking?"&mdash;"More than that; extremely pretty,
innocent, and artless."</p>

<p class="indent">"Arrah&mdash;give me another kiss, for I'm proud of ye;" and Captain
O'Finn's representative clasped me in her arms.</p>

<p class="indent">"But the family, Terence; remember the old stock. Is she one of
us?"&mdash;"She is highly respectable. An only daughter, with excellent
expectations."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"What is her father, Terence?"&mdash;"A soldier, ma'am."</p>

<p class="indent">"Lord!&mdash;quite enough. He's by profession a gentleman; and we
can't expect to find every day, descendants from the kings of Connaught,
like the O'Shaughnessys and the O'Finns. But when is it to
take place, Terence?"&mdash;"Why, faith, ma'am, it was a bit of a secret;
but I can keep nothing from you."</p>

<p class="indent">"And why should ye? Haven't I been to you more than a mother,
Terence?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I am to be married this evening."</p>

<p class="indent">"This evening! Holy Saint Patrick! and you're sure of the
money? It's not a rent-charge&mdash;nothing of bills or bonds?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing but bank-notes; nothing but the
<i>aragudh-sheese</i>."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="indent">"Ogh! my blessing be about ye night and day. Arrah,
Terence, what's her name?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You'll not mention it. We want the thing done quietly."</p>

<p class="indent">"Augh, Terence; and do you think I would let any thing ye
told me slip? By this cross,"&mdash;and Mrs. O'Finn bisected the forefinger
of her left hand with the corresponding digit of the right one; "the
face of clay shall never be the wiser of any thing ye mention!"</p>

<p class="indent">After this desperate adjuration there was no
refusing my aunt's request.</p>

<p class="indent">"You know her well,"&mdash;and I looked extremely cunning.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do I, Terence? Let me see&mdash;I have it. It's Ellen Robinson.
No&mdash;though her money's safe, there's but five hundred ready."</p>

<p class="indent">"Guess again, aunt."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it Bessie Lloyd? No&mdash;though the old miller is rich as a Jew,
he would not part a guinea to save the whole human race, or make
his daughter a duchess."&mdash;"Far from the mark as ever, aunt."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," returned Mrs. O'Finn, with sigh, "I'm fairly puzzled."</p>

<p class="indent">"Whisper!" and I playfully took her hand, and put my lips close
to her cheek. "It's&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Who?&mdash;who, for the sake of Heaven?"&mdash;"Biddy MacGawly!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Jasus!" ejaculated the captain's relict, as she
sank upon a chair. "I'm murdered! Give me my salts, there. Terence
O'Shaughnessy, don't touch me. I put the cross between us," and
she made a crucial flourish with her hand. "You have finished
me, ye villain. Holy Virgin! what sins have I committed, that I
should be disgraced in my old age? Meat never crossed my lips of
a Friday; I was regular at mass, and never missed confession; and,
when the company were honest, played as fair as every body else.
I wish I was at peace with poor dear Pat O'Finn. Oh! murder!
murder!"</p>

<p class="indent">I stared in amazement. If Roger MacGawly had been a
highwayman, his daughter could not have been an object of greater horror
to Mrs O'Finn. At last I mustered words to attempt to reason with
her, but to my desultory appeals she returned abuse fit only for a
pickpocket to receive.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hear me, madam."&mdash;"Oh, you common
<i>ommadawn</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p class="indent">"For Heaven's sake, listen!"&mdash;"Oh! that the O'Finns and the
O'Shaughnessys should be disgraced by a mean-spirited <i>gommouge</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
of your kind!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"You won't hear me."&mdash;"Biddy MacGawly!" she exclaimed.
"Why, bad as my poor brother, your father, was&mdash;and though he too
married a devil that has helped to ruin him, she was at all events a lady
in her own right, and cousin-german to Lord Lowestoffe. But&mdash;you&mdash;you
unfortunate disciple."</p>

<p class="indent">I began to wax warm, for my aunt complimented me with all the
abuse she could muster, and there never was a cessation but when
her breath failed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, what have I done? What am I about doing?" I demanded.&mdash;"Just
going," returned Mrs. O'Finn, "to make a Judy Fitzsimmons
mother of yourself?"</p>

<p class="indent">"And is it," said I, "because Miss MacGawly can't count her
pedigree from Fin Macoul that she should not discharge the duties of a
wife?"</p>

<p class="indent">My aunt broke in upon me.</p>

<p class="indent">"There's one thing certain, that she'll discharge the duties of
a mother. Heavens! if you had married a girl with only a <i>blast</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
your connexions might brazen it out. But a woman in such a barefaced
condition!&mdash;as if her staying in the house these three months
could blind the neighbours, and close their mouths."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, in the devil's name, will you say what objection exists
to Biddy MacGawly making me a husband to-night?"&mdash;"And a papa in
three months afterwards!" rejoined my loving aunt.</p>

<p class="indent">If a shell had burst in the bivouac, I could not have been
more electrified. Dark suspicions flashed across my mind&mdash;a host of
circumstances confirmed my doubts; and I implored the widow of the
defunct dragoon to tell me all she knew.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a simple, although, as far as I was concerned, not a
flattering narrative. Biddy had commenced an equestrian novitiate under
the tutelage of Lieutenant Hastings. Her progress in the art of
horsemanship was, no doubt, very satisfactory, and the pupil and the
professor frequently rode out <i>tête-à-tête</i>. Biddy, poor soul! was fearful
of exhibiting any <i>mal-addresse</i>, and of course, roads less frequented
than the king's highway were generally chosen for her riding lessons.
Gradually these excursions became more extensive; twilight, and in
summer too, often fell, before the quartermaster's heiress had returned;
and on one unfortunate occasion she was absent for a week.
This caused as desperate commotion in the town; the dowagers and
old maids sat in judgment on the case, and declared Biddy no longer
visitable. In vain her absence was ascribed to accident&mdash;a horse had
run away&mdash;she was thrown&mdash;her ankle sprained&mdash;and she was detained
unavoidably at a country inn until the injury was abated.</p>

<p class="indent">In this state of things the dragoons were ordered off;
and it was whispered that there had been a desperate blow-up between the
young lady's preceptor the lieutenant, and her papa the quartermaster.
Once only had Biddy ventured out upon the mall; but she
was cut dead by her quondam acquaintances. From that day she
seldom appeared abroad; and when she did, it was always in the
evening, and even then closely muffled up. No wonder scandal was
rife touching the causes of her seclusion. A few charitably ascribed
it to bad health&mdash;others to disappointment&mdash;but the greater proportion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of the fair sex attributed her confinement to the true cause, and
whispered that Miss MacGawly was "as ladies wished to be who
love their lords."</p>

<p class="indent">Here was a solution to the mystery! It was now pretty
easy to comprehend why Biddy was swathed like a mummy, and Roger so
ready with his cash. No wonder the <i>demoiselle</i> was anxious to
abridge delay, and the old crimp so obliging in procuring a priest and
preparing all requisite matters or immediate hymeneals. What was
to be done? What, but denounce the frail fair one, and annihilate
that villain her father. Without a word or explanation I caught up
my hat, and left the house in a hurry, and Mrs. O'Finn in a state
of nervousness that threatened to become hysterical.</p>

<p class="indent">When I reached the quartermaster's habitation, I hastened
to my own apartment, and got my traps together in double-quick. I intended
to have abdicated quietly, and favoured the intended Mrs.
O'Shaughnessy with an epistle communicating the reasons that induced
me to decline the honour of her hand; but on the landing my
worthy father-in-law cut off my retreat, and a parting
<i>tête-a-tête</i> became unavoidable. He appeared in great spirits
at the success of his interview with the parson.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Terence, I have done the business. The old chap
made a parcel of objections; but he's poor as Lazarus&mdash;slily slipped
him ten pounds, and that quieted his scruples. He's ready at a
moment's warning."&mdash;"He's a useful person," I replied drily; "and
all you want is a son-in-law."</p>

<p class="indent">"A what?" exclaimed the father of Miss Biddy.&mdash;"A son-in-law!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, what the devil do you mean?"&mdash;"Not a jot more
or less than what I say. You have procured the priest, but I suspect the
bridegroom will not be forthcoming."</p>

<p class="indent">"Zounds, sir! do you mean to treat my daughter with
disrespect?"&mdash;"Upon consideration, it would be hardly fair to deprive
my old friend Hastings of his pupil. Why, with another week's
private tuition Biddy might offer her services to Astley."</p>

<p class="indent">"Sir,&mdash;if you mean to be impertinent,&mdash;" and Roger
began to bluster, while the noise brought the footman to the hall, and Miss
Biddy to the banisters 'shawled to the nose.' I began to lose temper.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, you infernal old crimp!"&mdash;"You
audacious young scoundrel!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Jasus! gentlemen! Pace, for the sake of the blessed
Mother!" cried the butler from below.</p>

<p class="indent">"Father, jewel! Terence, my only love!" screamed Miss Biddy,
over the staircase. "What is the matter?"&mdash;"He wants to be off!"
roared the quartermaster.</p>

<p class="indent">"Stop, Terence, or you'll have my life to answer for."&mdash;"Lord,
Biddy, how fat you are grown!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You shall fulfil your promise," cried Roger, "or I'll
write to the Horse Guards, and memorial the commander-in-chief."&mdash;"You
may memorial your best friend, the devil, you old crimp!" and I
forced my way to the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come back, you deceiver!" exclaimed Miss MacGawly.&mdash;"Arrah,

<p class="indent">"Oh, I'm fainting!" screamed Roger's heiress.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't let him out!" roared her sire.</p>

<p class="indent">The gentleman with the beefsteak collar made a demonstration
to interrupt my retreat, and in return received a box on the ear
that sent him halfway down the kitchen stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">"There," I said, "give that to the old rogue, your master,
with my best compliments,"&mdash;and bounding from the hall-door, Biddy
MacGawly, like Lord Ullin's daughter, "was left lamenting!"</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Well, there is no describing
the <i>rookawn</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> a blow-up like this,
occasioned in a country town. I was unmercifully quizzed; but the
quartermaster and his heiress found it advisable to abdicate. Roger
removed his household goods to the metropolis&mdash;Miss Biddy
favoured him in due time with a grandson; and when I returned
from South America, I learned that "this lost love of mine" had
accompanied a Welsh lieutenant to the hymeneal altar, who, not
being "over-particular" about trifles, had obtained on the same morning
a wife, an heir, and an estate&mdash;with Roger's blessing into the bargain.</p>

<h2>REDDY O'DRYSCULL,</h2>
<p class="f90">SCHOOLMASTER AT WATER-GRASS-HILL,</p>
<p class="f120"><b>TO MR. BENTLEY, PUBLISHER.</b></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I write to you concerning
the late P.P. of this parish&mdash;his soul to glory! for, as Virgil says,
&mdash;and devil a doubt of it,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">His <span class="smcap">RELIQUES</span>, sir,
in two volumes, have been sent down here
from Dublin, for the use of my boys, by order of the National
<i>Education</i> Board, with directions to cram the spalpeens all at
once with such a power of knowledge that they may forget the
hunger: which plan, between you and me, (though I say it
that oughtn't) is all sheer <i>bladderum-skate</i>: for, as Juvenal
maintains, <i>jejunus stomachus</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;an empty bag won't
stand; you must first fill it with praties. Give us a poor-law, sir, and,
trust me, you will hear no more about Rock and repeal; no, nor
of the <i>rint</i>, against which latter humbug the man of God set his
face outright during his honest and honourable lifetime; for,
sir, though he differed with Mr. Moore about Irish round
towers, and a few French roundelays, in <i>this</i> they fully agreed.</p>

<p class="indent">As I understand, sir, that you are Publisher in ordinary
to his Majesty, I intend from time to time conveying through you
to the ear of royalty some <i>desiderata curiosa Hyberniæ</i> from
the pen of the deceased; matters which remain <i>penès me, in scriniis</i>,
to use the style of your great namesake. For the present,
I merely send you a few classic scraps collected by Dr. Prout
in some convent abroad; and, wishing every success to your
Miscellany, am your humble servant,

<h2><span class="smcap">Scrap</span>, No. I.</h2>
<p class="author"><big><i>Water-grass-hill.</i></big></p>

<p class="indent">There flourishes, I hear, in London,
a Mr. <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>, whose
reputation as a comic lyrist, it would seem, has firmly taken root
in the great metropolis. Many are the laughter-compelling productions
of his merry genius; but "<i>Barney Brallaghan's Courtship</i>"
may be termed his <i>opus magnum</i>. It has been my lot to
pick a few dry leaves from the laurel-wreath of Mr. Moore,
who could well afford the loss: I know not whether I can meddle
rightly after a similar fashion with <i>Hudson's</i> bay. Yet
is there a strange coincidence of thought and expression, and
even metre, between the following remnant of antiquity, and his
never-sufficiently-to-be-encored song.</p>

<p class="indent">The original may be seen at Bobbio in the Apennines,&mdash;a
Benedictine settlement, well known as the earliest asylum opened
to learning after the fall of the Roman Empire. The Irish
monk Colombanus had the merit of founding it, and it long
remained tenanted by natives of Ireland. Among them it has
been ascertained that <span class="smcap">Dante</span> lived for some time,
and composed Latin verses; but I cannot recognise any trace of <i>his</i> stern
phraseology in the ballad. It appears rather the production of
some rustic of the Augustan age; perhaps one of Horace's
ploughmen. It is addressed to a certain Julia Callapyg&eacute;,
<b>&Kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&pi;&nu;&gamma;&eta;</b>,
a name which (for shortness I suppose) the rural
poet contracts into Julia "<span class="smcap">Callag&eacute;</span>." I have diligently
compared it with the vulgate version, as sung by Fitzwilliam at the
Freemasons' Tavern; and little doubt can remain of its identity
and authenticity.</p>

<h2>PUBLIC LIFE OF MR. TULRUMBLE,</h2>
<p class="f90"><b>ONCE MAYOR OF MUDFOG.</b></p>

<p class="indent space-above1">Mudfog is a pleasant town&mdash;a remarkably pleasant
town&mdash;situated in a charming hollow by the side of a river, from which
river, Mudfog derives an agreeable scent of pitch, tar, coals, and
rope-yarn, a roving population in oil-skin hats, a pretty steady
influx of drunken bargemen, and a great many other maritime
advantages. There is a good deal of water about Mudfog,
and yet it is not exactly the sort of town for a watering-place,
either. Water is a perverse sort of element at the best of times,
and in Mudfog it is particularly so. In winter, it comes oozing
down the streets and tumbling over the fields,&mdash;nay, rushes into
the very cellars and kitchens of the houses, with a lavish prodigality
that might well be dispensed with; but in the hot summer
weather it <i>will</i> dry up, and turn green: and, although
green is a very good colour in its way, especially in grass, still it
certainly is not becoming to water; and it cannot be denied that
the beauty of Mudfog is rather impaired, even by this trifling
circumstance. Mudfog is a healthy place&mdash;very healthy;&mdash;damp,
perhaps, but none the worse for that. It's quite a mistake
to suppose that damp is unwholesome: plants thrive best in
damp situations, and why shouldn't men? The inhabitants of
Mudfog are unanimous in asserting that there exists not a finer
race of people on the face of the earth; here we have an indisputable
and veracious contradiction of the vulgar error at
once. So, admitting Mudfog to be damp, we distinctly state
that it is salubrious.</p>

<p class="indent">The town of Mudfog is extremely picturesque. Limehouse
and Ratcliffe Highway are both something like it, but they give
you a very faint idea of Mudfog. There are a great many
more public-houses in Mudfog,&mdash;more than in Ratcliffe Highway
and Limehouse put together. The public buildings, too,
are very imposing. We consider the Town-hall one of the
finest specimens of shed architecture, extant: it is a combination
of the pig-sty and tea-garden-box, orders; and the simplicity of its
design is of surpassing beauty. The idea of placing a large
window on one side of the door, and a small one on the other, is
particularly happy. There is a fine bold Doric beauty, too,
about the padlock and scraper, which is strictly in keeping with
the general effect.</p>

<p class="indent">In this room do the mayor and corporation of Mudfog
assemble together in solemn council for the public weal.
Seated on the massive wooden benches, which, with the table in
the centre, form the only furniture of the whitewashed apartment,
the sage men of Mudfog spend hour after hour in grave
deliberation. Here they settle at what hour of the night the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
public-houses shall be closed, at what hour of the morning they
shall be permitted to open, how soon it shall be lawful for people
to eat their dinner on church-days, and other great political
questions; and sometimes, long after silence has fallen on the
town, and the distant lights from the shops and houses have
ceased to twinkle, like far-off stars, to the sight of the boatmen
on the river, the illumination in the two unequal-sized windows
of the town-hall, warns the inhabitants of Mudfog that its little
body of legislators, like a larger and better-known body of the
same genus, a great deal more noisy, and not a whit more profound,
are patriotically dozing away in company, far into the
night, for their country's good.</p>

<p class="indent">Among this knot of sage and learned men, no one was
so eminently distinguished, during many years, for the quiet modesty
of his appearance and demeanour, as Nicholas Tulrumble, the
well-known coal-dealer. However exciting the subject of discussion,
however animated the tone of the debate, or however
warm the personalities exchanged, (and even in Mudfog we get
personal sometimes,) Nicholas Tulrumble was always the same.
To say truth, Nicholas, being an industrious man, and always
up betimes, was apt to fall asleep when a debate began, and to
remain asleep till it was over, when he would wake up very
much refreshed, and give his vote with the greatest complacency.
The fact was, that Nicholas Tulrumble, knowing that
everybody there, had made up his mind beforehand, considered
the talking as just a long hot botheration about nothing at all; and
to the present hour it remains a question, whether, on this point
at all events, Nicholas Tulrumble was not pretty near right.</p>

<p class="indent">Time, which strews a man's head with silver, sometimes
fills his pockets with gold. As he gradually performed one good
office for Nicholas Tulrumble, he was obliging enough, not to
omit the other. Nicholas began life in a wooden tenement of
four feet square, with a capital of two and ninepence, and a
stock in trade of three bushels and a-half of coals, exclusive of
the large lump which hung, by way of sign-board, outside.
Then he enlarged the shed, and kept a truck; then he left the
shed, and the truck too, and started a donkey and a Mrs. Tulrumble;
then he moved again and set up a cart; the cart was
soon afterwards exchanged for a waggon; and so he went on,
like his great predecessor Whittington&mdash;only without a cat for
a partner&mdash;increasing in wealth and fame, until at last he gave
up business altogether, and retired with Mrs. Tulrumble and
family to Mudfog Hall, which he had himself erected, on something
which he endeavoured to delude himself into the belief
was a hill, about a quarter of a mile distant from the town of
Mudfog.</p>

<p class="indent">About this time, it began to be murmured in Mudfog that
Nicholas Tulrumble was growing vain and haughty; that prosperity
and success had corrupted the simplicity of his manners,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and tainted the natural goodness of his heart; in short, that he
was setting up for a public character, and a great gentleman,
and affected to look down upon his old companions with compassion
and contempt. Whether these reports were at the time
well-founded, or not, certain it is that Mrs. Tulrumble very
shortly afterwards started a four-wheel chaise, driven by a tall
postilion in a yellow cap,&mdash;that Mr. Tulrumble junior took to
smoking cigars, and calling the footman a "feller,"&mdash;and that
Mr. Tulrumble from that time forth, was no more seen in his old
seat in the chimney-corner of the Lighterman's Arms at night.
This looked bad; but, more than this, it began to be observed
that Mr. Nicholas Tulrumble attended the corporation meetings
more frequently than heretofore; that he no longer went to
sleep as he had done for so many years, but propped his eyelids
open with his two fore-fingers; that he read the newspapers by
himself at home; and that he was in the habit of indulging
abroad in distant and mysterious allusions to "masses of people,"
and "the property of the country," and "productive
power," and "the monied interest:" all of which denoted and
proved that Nicholas Tulrumble was either mad, or worse; and
it puzzled the good people of Mudfog amazingly.</p>

<p class="indent">At length, about the middle of the month of October,
Mr. Tulrumble and family went up to London; the middle of October
being, as Mrs. Tulrumble informed her acquaintance in Mudfog,
the very height of the fashionable season.</p>

<p class="indent">Somehow or other, just about this time, despite the
health-preserving air of Mudfog, the Mayor died. It was a most extraordinary
circumstance; he had lived in Mudfog for eighty-five
years. The corporation didn't understand it at all; indeed
it was with great difficulty that one old gentleman, who was a
great stickler for forms, was dissuaded from proposing a vote of
censure on such unaccountable conduct. Strange as it was,
however, die he did, without taking the slightest notice of the
corporation; and the corporation were imperatively called upon
to elect his successor. So, they met for the purpose; and being
very full of Nicholas Tulrumble just then, and Nicholas Tulrumble
being a very important man, they elected him, and wrote
off to London by the very next post to acquaint Nicholas Tulrumble
with his new elevation.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, it being November time, and Mr. Nicholas Tulrumble
being in the capital, it fell out that he was present at the Lord
Mayor's show and dinner, at sight of the glory and splendour
whereof, he, Mr. Tulrumble, was greatly mortified, inasmuch as
the reflection would force itself on his mind, that, had he been
born in London instead of in Mudfog, he might have been a
Lord Mayor too, and have patronised the judges, and been
affable to the Lord Chancellor, and friendly with the Premier,
and coldly condescending to the Secretary to the Treasury, and
have dined with a flag behind his back, and done a great many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
other acts and deeds which unto Lord Mayors of London peculiarly
appertain. The more he thought of the Lord Mayor, the
more enviable a personage he seemed. To be a King was all
very well; but what was the King to the Lord Mayor? When
the King made a speech, everybody knew it was somebody else's
writing; whereas here was the Lord Mayor talking away for
half an hour&mdash;all out of his own head&mdash;amidst the enthusiastic
applause of the whole company, while it was notorious that the
King might talk to his parliament till he was black in the face
without getting so much as a single cheer. As all these reflections
passed through the mind of Mr. Nicholas Tulrumble, the
Lord Mayor of London appeared to him the greatest sovereign
on the face of the earth, beating the Emperor of Russia all to
nothing, and leaving the Great Mogul immeasurably behind.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Nicholas Tulrumble was pondering over these things,
and inwardly cursing the fate which had pitched his coal-shed
in Mudfog, when the letter of the corporation was put into his
hand. A crimson flush mantled over his face as he read it, for
visions of brightness were already dancing before his imagination.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear," said Mr. Tulrumble to his wife, "they have
elected me, Mayor of Mudfog."</p>

<p class="indent">"Lor-a-mussy!" said Mrs. Tulrumble: "why, what's become
of old Sniggs?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The late Mr. Sniggs, Mrs. Tulrumble," said Mr. Tulrumble
sharply, for he by no means approved of the notion of unceremoniously
designating a gentleman who had filled the high
office of Mayor as "old Sniggs,"&mdash;"The late Mr. Sniggs,
Mrs. Tulrumble, is dead."</p>

<p class="indent">The communication was very unexpected; but Mrs. Tulrumble
only ejaculated "Lor-a-mussy!" once again, as if a Mayor
were a mere ordinary Christian, at which Mr. Tulrumble frowned gloomily.</p>

<p class="indent">"What a pity 'tan't in London, ain't it?" said Mrs. Tulrumble,
after a short pause; "what a pity 'tan't in London,
where you might have had a show."</p>

<p class="indent">"I <i>might</i> have a show in Mudfog, if I thought proper, I
apprehend," said Mr. Tulrumble mysteriously.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lor! so you might, I declare," replied Mrs. Tulrumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"And a good one, too," said Mr. Tulrumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"Delightful!" exclaimed Mrs. Tulrumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"One which would rather astonish the ignorant people down
there," said Mr. Tulrumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"It would kill them with envy," said Mrs. Tulrumble.</p>

<p class="indent">So it was agreed that his Majesty's lieges in Mudfog
should be astonished with splendour, and slaughtered with envy, and
that such a show should take place as had never been seen in that
town, or in any other town before,&mdash;no, not even in London itself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">On the very next day after the receipt of the letter, down
came the tall postilion in a post-chaise,&mdash;not upon one of the horses,
but inside&mdash;actually inside the chaise,&mdash;and, driving up to the
very door of the town-hall, where the corporation were assembled,
delivered a letter, written by the Lord knows who, and signed by
Nicholas Tulrumble, in which Nicholas said, all through four
sides of closely-written, gilt-edged, hot-pressed, Bath post
letter-paper, that he responded to the call of his fellow-townsmen
with feelings of heartfelt delight; that he accepted the arduous
office which their confidence had imposed upon him; that they
would never find him shrinking from the discharge of his duty;
that he would endeavour to execute his functions with all that
dignity which their magnitude and importance demanded; and
a great deal more to the same effect. But even this was not all.
The tall postilion produced from his right-hand top-boot, a
damp copy of that afternoon's number of the county paper;
and there, in large type, running the whole length of the very
first column, was a long address from Nicholas Tulrumble to
the inhabitants of Mudfog, in which he said that he cheerfully
complied with their requisition, and, in short, as if to prevent
any mistake about the matter, told them over again what a
grand fellow he meant to be, in very much the same terms as
those in which he had already told them all about the matter in
his letter.</p>

<p class="indent">The corporation stared at one another very hard at all
this, and then looked as if for explanation to the tall postilion, but as
the tall postilion was intently contemplating the gold tassel on
the top of his yellow cap, and could have afforded no explanation
whatever, even if his thoughts had been entirely disengaged,
they contented themselves with coughing very dubiously, and
looking very grave. The tall postilion then delivered another
letter, in which Nicholas Tulrumble informed the corporation,
that he intended repairing to the town-hall, in grand state and
gorgeous procession, on the Monday afternoon then next ensuing.
At this, the corporation looked still more solemn; but, as
the epistle wound up with a formal invitation to the whole body
to dine with the Mayor on that day, at Mudfog Hall, Mudfog
Hill, Mudfog, they began to see the fun of the thing directly,
and sent back their compliments, and they'd be sure to come.</p>

<p class="indent">Now there happened to be in Mudfog, as somehow or other
there does happen to be, in almost every town in the British dominions,
and perhaps in foreign dominions too&mdash;we think it very
likely, but, being no great traveller, cannot distinctly say&mdash;there
happened to be, in Mudfog a merry-tempered, pleasant-faced,
good-for-nothing sort of vagabond, with an invincible dislike
to manual labour, and an unconquerable attachment to
strong beer and spirits whom everybody knew, and nobody,
except his wife, took the trouble to quarrel with, who inherited
from his ancestors the appellation of Edward Twigger, and rejoiced
in the <i>sobriquet</i> of Bottle-nosed Ned. He was drunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
upon the average once a day, and penitent upon an equally fair
calculation once a month; and when he was penitent, he was
invariably in the very last stage of maudlin intoxication. He
was a ragged, roving, roaring kind of fellow, with a burly form,
a sharp wit, and a ready head, and could turn his hand to anything
when he chose to do it. He was by no means opposed to
hard labour on principle, for he would work away at a cricket-match
by the day together,&mdash;running, and catching, and batting,
and bowling, and revelling in toil which would exhaust a galley-slave.
He would have been invaluable to a fire-office; never
was a man with such a natural taste for pumping engines, running
up ladders, and throwing furniture out of two-pair-of-stairs'
windows: nor was this the only element in which he was
at home; he was a humane society in himself, a portable drag,
an animated life-preserver, and had saved more people, in his
time, from drowning, than the Plymouth life-boat, or Captain
Manby's apparatus. With all these qualifications, notwithstanding
his dissipation, Bottle-nosed Ned was a general favourite;
and the authorities of Mudfog, remembering his numerous
services to the population, allowed him in return to get
drunk in his own way, without the fear of stocks, fine, or
imprisonment. He had a general licence, and he showed his sense
of the compliment by making the most of it.</p>

<p class="indent">We have been thus particular in describing the character
and avocations of Bottle-nosed Ned, because it enables us to introduce
a fact politely, without hauling it into the reader's presence
with indecent haste by the head and shoulders, and brings
us very naturally to relate, that on the very same evening on
which Mr. Nicholas Tulrumble and family returned to Mudfog,
Mr. Tulrumble's new secretary, just imported from London,
with a pale face and light whiskers, thrust his head down to
the very bottom of his neckcloth-tie, in at the tap-room door
of the Lighterman's Arms, and enquiring whether one Ned
Twigger was luxuriating within, announced himself as the
bearer of a message from Nicholas Tulrumble, Esquire, requiring
Mr. Twigger's immediate attendance at the hall, on private
and particular business. It being by no means Mr. Twigger's
interest to affront the Mayor, he rose from the fire-place
with a slight sigh, and followed the light-whiskered secretary
through the dirt and wet of Mudfog streets, up to Mudfog Hall,
without further ado.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Nicholas Tulrumble was seated in a small cavern with
a skylight, which he called his library, sketching out a plan of the
procession on a large sheet of paper; and into the cavern the secretary
ushered Ned Twigger.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Twigger!" said Nicholas Tulrumble, condescendingly.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a time when Twigger would have replied, "Well,
Nick!" but that was in the days of the truck, and a couple of
years before the donkey; so, he only bowed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"I want you to go into training, Twigger," said Mr. Tulrumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"What for, sir?" enquired Ned, with a stare.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush, hush, Twigger!" said the Mayor. "Shut the door,
Mr. Jennings. Look here, Twigger."</p>

<p class="indent">As the Mayor said this, he unlocked a high closet, and disclosed
a complete suit of brass armour, of gigantic dimensions.</p>

<p class="indent">"I want you to wear this, next Monday, Twigger," said the
Mayor.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bless your heart and soul, sir!" replied Ned, "you might
as well ask me to wear a seventy-four pounder, or a cast-iron
boiler."</p>

<p class="indent">"Nonsense, Twigger! nonsense!" said the Mayor.</p>

<p class="indent">"I couldn't stand under it, sir," said Twigger; "it would
make mashed potatoes of me, if I attempted it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Pooh, pooh, Twigger!" returned the Mayor. "I tell you
I have seen it done with my own eyes, in London, and the man
wasn't half such a man as you are, either."</p>

<p class="indent">"I should as soon have thought of a man's wearing the case
of an eight-day clock to save his linen," said Twigger, casting
a look of apprehension at the brass suit.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's the easiest thing in the world," rejoined the Mayor.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's nothing," said Mr. Jennings.</p>

<p class="indent">"When you're used to it," added Ned.</p>

<p class="indent">"You do it by degrees," said the Mayor. "You would begin
with one piece to-morrow, and two the next day, and so on,
till you had got it all on. Mr. Jennings, give Twigger a glass
of rum. Just try the breast-plate, Twigger. Stay; take another
glass of rum first. Help me to lift it, Mr. Jennings.
Stand firm, Twigger! There!&mdash;it isn't half as heavy as it looks,
is it?"</p>

<p class="indent">Twigger was a good strong, stout fellow; so, after
a great deal of staggering he managed to keep himself up, under the
breast-plate, and even contrived, with the aid of another glass of
rum, to walk about in it, and the gauntlets into the bargain. He
made a trial of the helmet, but was not equally successful, inasmuch
he tipped over instantly,&mdash;an accident which Mr. Tulrumble
clearly demonstrated to be occasioned by his not having
a counteracting weight of brass on his legs.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, wear that with grace and propriety on Monday next,"
said Tulrumble, "and I'll make your fortune."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll try what I can do, sir," said Twigger.</p>

<p class="indent">"It must be kept a profound secret," said Tulrumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course, sir," replied Twigger.</p>

<p class="indent">"And you must be sober," said Tulrumble; "perfectly
sober."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Twigger at once solemnly pledged himself to be
as sober as a judge, and Nicholas Tulrumble was satisfied, although,
had we been Nicholas, we should certainly have exacted some promise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of a more specific nature; inasmuch as, having attended the
Mudfog assizes in the evening more than once, we can solemnly
testify to having seen judges with very strong symptoms of
dinner under their wigs. However, that's neither here nor there.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day, and the day following, and the day after
that, Ned Twigger was securely locked up in the small cavern with
the skylight, hard at work at the armour. With every additional
piece he could manage to stand upright in, he had on additional
glass of rum; and at last, after many partial suffocations,
he contrived to get on the whole suit, and to stagger up
and down the room in it, like an intoxicated effigy from
Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p class="indent">Never was man so delighted as Nicholas Tulrumble;
never was woman so charmed as Nicholas Tulrumble's wife. Here
was a sight for the common people of Mudfog! A live man in
brass armour! Why, they would go wild with wonder!</p>

<p class="indent">The day&mdash;<i>the</i> Monday&mdash;arrived.</p>

<p class="indent">If the morning had been made to order, it couldn't
have been better adapted to the purpose. They never showed a better
fog in London on Lord Mayor's day, than enwrapped the town of
Mudfog on that eventful occasion. It had risen slowly and
surely from the green and stagnant water with the first light of
morning, until it reached a little above the lamp-post tops; and
there it had stopped, with a sleepy, sluggish obstinacy, which
bade defiance to the sun, who had got up very blood-shot about
the eyes, as if he had been at a drinking-party over night, and
was doing his day's work with the worst possible grace. The
thick damp mist hung over the town like a huge gauze curtain.
All was dim and dismal. The church-steeples had bidden a
temporary adieu to the world below; and every object of lesser
importance&mdash;houses, barns, hedges, trees, and barges&mdash;had all
taken the veil.</p>

<p class="indent">The church-clock struck one. A cracked trumpet from
the front-garden of Mudfog Hall produced a feeble flourish, as if
some asthmatic person had coughed into it accidentally; the
gate flew open, and out came a gentleman, on a moist-sugar coloured
charger, intended to represent a herald, but bearing a
much stronger resemblance to a court-card on horseback. This
was one of the Circus people, who always came down to Mudfog
at that time of the year, and who had been engaged by Nicholas
Tulrumble expressly for the occasion. There was the horse,
whisking his tail about, balancing himself on his hind-legs, and
flourishing away with his fore-feet, in a manner which would
have gone to the hearts and souls of any reasonable crowd. But
a Mudfog crowd never was a reasonable one, and in all probability
never will be. Instead of scattering the very fog with
their shouts, as they ought most indubitably to have done, and
were fully intended to do, by Nicholas Tulrumble, they no
sooner recognised the herald, than they began to growl forth the
most unqualified disapprobation at the bare notion of his riding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
like any other man. If he had come out on his head indeed, or
jumping through a hoop, or flying through a red-hot drum, or
even standing on one leg with his other foot in his mouth, they
might have had something to say to him; but for a professional
gentleman to sit astride in the saddle, with his feet in the stirrups,
was rather too good a joke. So, the herald was a decided
failure, and the crowd hooted with great energy, as he pranced
ingloriously away.</p>

<p class="indent">On the procession came. We were afraid to say how
many supernumeraries there were, in striped shirts and black velvet
caps, to imitate the London watermen, or how many base
imitations of running-footmen, or how many banners, which,
owing to the heaviness of the atmosphere, could by no means be
prevailed on to display their inscriptions: still less do we feel
disposed to relate how the men who played the wind instruments,
looking up into the sky (we mean the fog) with musical
fervour, walked through pools of water and hillocks of mud,
till they covered the powdered heads of the running-footmen
aforesaid with splashes, that looked curious, but not ornamental;
or how the barrel-organ performer put on the wrong stop, and
played one tune while the band played another; or how the
horses, being used to the arena, and not to the streets, would
stand still and dance, instead of going on and prancing;&mdash;all of
which are matters which might be dilated upon to great advantage,
but which we have not the least intention of dilating upon,
notwithstanding.</p>

<p class="indent">Oh! it was a grand and beautiful sight to behold the
corporation in glass coaches, provided at the sole cost and charge of
Nicholas Tulrumble, coming rolling along, like a funeral out of
mourning, and to watch the attempts the corporation made to
look great and solemn, when Nicholas Tulrumble himself, in the
four-wheel chaise, with the tall postilion, rolled out after them,
with Mr. Jennings on one side to look like the chaplain, and a
supernumerary on the other, with an old life-guardsman's sabre,
to imitate the sword-bearer; and to see the tears rolling down
the faces of the mob as they screamed with merriment. This was
beautiful! and so was the appearance of Mrs. Tulrumble and
son, as they bowed with grave dignity out of their coach-window
to all the dirty faces that were laughing around them: but it is
not even with this that we have to do, but with the sudden stopping
of the procession at another blast of the trumpet, whereat,
and whereupon, a profound silence ensued, and all eyes were
turned towards Mudfog Hull, in the confident anticipation of
some new wonder.</p>

<p class="indent">"They won't laugh now, Mr. Jennings,"
said Nicholas Tulrumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think not, sir," said Mr. Jennings.</p>

<p class="indent">"See how eager they look," said Nicholas Tulrumble.
"Aha! the laugh will be on our side now; eh, Mr. Jennings?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No doubt of that, sir," replied Mr. Jennings; and Nicholas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Tulrumble, in a state of pleasurable excitement, stood up in the
four-wheel chaise, and telegraphed gratification to the Mayoress behind.</p>

<p class="indent">While all this was going forward, Ned Twigger had
descended into the kitchen of Mudfog Hall for the purpose of indulging
the servants with a private view of the curiosity that was to
burst upon the town; and, somehow or other, the footman was
so companionable, and the housemaid so kind, and the cook so
friendly, that he could not resist the offer of the first-mentioned
to sit down and take something&mdash;just to drink success to master in.</p>

<p class="indent">So, down Ned Trigger sat himself in his brass livery
on the top of the kitchen-table; and in a mug of something strong, paid
for by the unconscious Nicholas Tulrumble, and provided by the
companionable footman, drank success to the Mayor and his
procession; and, as Ned laid by his helmet to imbibe the something
strong, the companionable footman put it on his own head,
to the immeasurable and unrecordable delight of the cook and
housemaid. The companionable footman was very facetious to
Ned, and Ned was very gallant to the cook and housemaid by
turns. They were all very cosy and comfortable; and the something
strong went briskly round.</p>

<p class="indent">At last Ned Twigger was loudly called for, by the procession
people: and, having had his helmet fixed on, in a very complicated
manner, by the companionable footman, and the kind
housemaid, and the friendly cook, he walked gravely forth, and
appeared before the multitude.</p>

<p class="indent">The crowd roared&mdash;it was not with wonder, it was not
with surprise; it was most decidedly and unquestionably with laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">"What!" said Mr. Tulrumble, starting up in the
four-wheel chaise. "Laughing? If they laugh at a man in real brass
armour, they'd laugh when their own fathers were dying.
Why doesn't he go into his place, Mr. Jennings? What's he
rolling down towards us for?&mdash;he has no business here!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I am afraid, sir&mdash;&mdash;" faltered Mr. Jennings.</p>

<p class="indent">"Afraid of what, sir?" said Nicholas Tulrumble, looking up
into the secretary's face.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am afraid he's drunk, sir;" replied Mr. Jennings.</p>

<p class="indent">Nicholas Tulrumble took one look at the extraordinary figure
that was bearing down upon them; and then, clasping his secretary
by the arm, uttered an audible groan in anguish of spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">It is a melancholy fact that Mr. Twigger having full
licence to demand a single glass of rum on the putting on of every piece
of the armour, got, by some means or other, rather out in his
calculation in the hurry and confusion of preparation, and drank
about four glasses to a piece instead of one, not to mention the
something strong which went on the top of it. Whether the brass
armour checked the natural flow of perspiration, and thus prevented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the spirit from evaporating, we are not scientific enough
to know; but, whatever the cause was, Mr. Twigger no sooner
found himself outside the gate of Mudfog Hall, than he also
found himself in a very considerable state of intoxication; and
hence his extraordinary style of progressing. This was bad
enough, but, as if fate and fortune had conspired against
Nicholas Tulrumble, Mr. Twigger, not having been penitent
for a good calendar month, took it into his head to be most
especially and particularly sentimental, just when his repentance
could have been most conveniently dispensed with. Immense
tears were rolling down his cheeks, and he was vainly endeavouring
to conceal his grief by applying to his eyes a blue cotton
pocket-handkerchief with white spots,&mdash;an article not strictly in
keeping with a suit of armour some three hundred years old,
or thereabouts.</p>

<p class="indent">"Twigger, you villain!" said Nicholas Tulrumble,
quite forgetting his dignity, "go back!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Never," said Ned. "I'm a miserable wretch.
I'll never leave you."</p>

<p class="indent">The by-standers of course received this declaration
with acclamations of "That's right, Ned; don't!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't intend it," said Ned, with all the obstinacy
of a very tipsy man. "I'm very unhappy. I'm the wretched father of
an unfortunate family; but I am very faithful, sir. I'll never
leave you." Having reiterated this obliging promise, Ned proceeded
in broken words to harangue the crowd upon the number
of years he had lived in Mudfog, the excessive respectability
of his character, and other topics of the like nature.</p>

<p class="indent">"Here! will anybody lead him away?" said Nicholas: "if
they'll call on me afterwards, I'll reward them well."</p>

<p class="indent">Two or three men stepped forward, with the view of bearing
Ned off, when the secretary interposed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Take care! take care!" said Mr. Jennings. "I beg your
pardon, sir; but they'd better not go too near him, because, if
he falls over, he'll certainly crush somebody."</p>

<p class="indent">At this hint the crowd retired on all sides to a
very respectful distance, and left Ned, like the Duke of Devonshire,
in a little circle of his own.</p>

<p class="indent">"But, Mr. Jennings," said Nicholas Tulrumble,
"he'll be suffocated."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm very sorry for it, sir," replied Mr. Jennings; "but
nobody can get that armour off, without his own assistance. I'm
quite certain of it, from the way he put it on."</p>

<p class="indent">Here Ned wept dolefully, and shook his helmeted head,
in a manner that might have touched a heart of stone; but the crowd
had not hearts of stone, and they laughed heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear me, Mr. Jennings," said Nicholas, turning pale at the
possibility of Ned's being smothered in his antique costume&mdash;"Dear
me, Mr. Jennings, can nothing be done with him?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing at all," replied Ned, "nothing at all.
Gentlemen, I'm an unhappy wretch. I'm a body, gentlemen, in a brass
coffin." At this poetical idea of his own conjuring up, Ned
cried so much that the people began to get sympathetic, and to
ask what Nicholas Tulrumble meant by putting a man into such
a machine as that; and one individual in a hairy waistcoat like
the top of a trunk, who had previously expressed his opinion
that if Ned hadn't been a poor man, Nicholas wouldn't have
dared to do it, hinted at the propriety of breaking the four-wheel
chaise, or Nicholas's head, or both, which last compound
proposition the crowd seemed to consider a very good notion.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not acted upon, however, for it had hardly
been broached, when Ned Twigger's wife made her appearance
abruptly in the little circle before noticed, and Ned no sooner
caught a glimpse of her face and form, than from the mere force
of habit he set off towards his home just as fast as his legs would
carry him; and that was not very quick in the present instance
either, for, however ready they might have been to carry <i>him</i>,
they couldn't get on very well under the brass armour. So,
Mrs. Twigger had plenty of time to denounce Nicholas Tulrumble
to his face: to express her opinion that he was a decided
monster; and to intimate that, if her ill-used husband sustained
any personal damage from the brass armour, she would have the
law of Nicholas Tulrumble for manslaughter. When she had
said all this with due vehemence, she posted after Ned, who was
dragging himself along as best he could, and deploring his unhappiness
in most dismal tones.</p>

<p class="indent">What a wailing and screaming Ned's children raised
when he got home at last! Mrs. Twigger tried to undo the armour, first
in one place, and then in another, but she couldn't manage it; so
she tumbled Ned into bed, helmet, armour, gauntlets, and all.
Such a creaking as the bedstead made, under Ned's weight in his
new suit! It didn't break down though; and there Ned lay,
like the anonymous vessel in the Bay of Biscay, till next day,
drinking barley-water, and looking miserable: and every time
he groaned, his good lady said it served him right, which was
all the consolation Ned Twigger got.</p>

<p class="indent">Nicholas Tulrumble and the gorgeous procession went
on together to the town-hall, amid the hisses and groans of all the
spectators, who had suddenly taken it into their heads to consider
poor Ned a martyr. Nicholas was formally installed
in his new office, in acknowledgment of which ceremony he delivered
himself of a speech, composed by the secretary, which
was very long and no doubt very good, only the noise of the
people outside prevented anybody from hearing it, but Nicholas
Tulrumble himself. After which, the procession got back to
Mudfog Hall any how it could; and Nicholas and the corporation
sat down to dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">But the dinner was flat, and Nicholas was disappointed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
They were such dull sleepy old fellows, that corporation.
Nicholas made quite as long speeches as the Lord Mayor of
London had done, nay, he said the very same things that the
Lord Mayor of London had said, and the deuce a cheer the
corporation gave him. There was only one man in the party
who was thoroughly awake; and he was insolent, and called
him Nick. Nick! What would be the consequence, thought
Nicholas, of anybody presuming to call the Lord Mayor of
London "Nick!" He should like to know what the sword-bearer
would say to that; or the recorder, or the toast-master, or
any other of the great officers of the city. They'd nick him.</p>

<p class="indent">But these were not the worst of Nicholas Tulrumble's
doings; If they had been, he might have remained a Mayor to this
day, and have talked till he lost his voice. He contracted a
relish for statistics, and got philosophical; and the statistics
and the philosophy together, led him into an act which increased
his unpopularity and hastened his downfall.</p>

<p class="indent">At the very end of the Mudfog High-street, and
abutting on the river-side, stands the Jolly Boatmen, an old-fashioned,
low-roofed, bay-windowed house, with a bar, kitchen, and tap-room
all in one, and a large fire-place with a kettle to correspond,
round which the working men have congregated time out of
mind on a winter's night, refreshed by draughts of good strong
beer, and cheered by the sounds of a fiddle and tambourine: the
Jolly Boatmen having been duly licensed by the Mayor and
corporation, to scrape the fiddle and thumb the tambourine
from time, whereof the memory of the oldest inhabitants
goeth not to the contrary. Now Nicholas Tulrumble had been
reading pamphlets on crime, and parliamentary reports,&mdash;or had
made the secretary read them to him, which is the same thing in
effect,&mdash;and he at once perceived that this fiddle and tambourine
must have done more to demoralise Mudfog, than any other
operating causes that ingenuity could imagine. So he read up
for the subject, and determined to come out on the corporation
with a burst, the very next time the licence was applied for.</p>

<p class="indent">The licensing day came, and the red-faced landlord
of the Jolly Boatmen, walked into the town-hall, looking as jolly as
need be, having actually put on an extra fiddle for that night,
to commemorate the anniversary of the Jolly Boatmen's music
licence. It was applied for in due form, and was just about to
be granted as a matter of course, when up rose Nicholas Tulrumble,
and drowned the astonished corporation in a torrent of
eloquence. He descanted in glowing terms upon the increasing
depravity of his native town of Mudfog, and the excesses committed
by its population. Then, he related how shocked he had
been, to see barrels of beer sliding down into the cellar of the
Jolly Boatmen week after week; and how he had sat at a window
opposite the Jolly Boatmen for two days together, to count
the people who went in for beer between the hours of twelve and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
one o'clock alone&mdash;which, by-the-bye, was the time at which the
great majority of the Mudfog people dined. Then, he went on
to state, how the number of people who came out with beer-jugs,
averaged twenty-one in five minutes, which, being multiplied by
twelve, gave two hundred and fifty-two people with beer-jugs in
an hour, and multiplied again by fifteen (the number of hours
during which the house was open daily) yielded three thousand
seven hundred and eighty people with beer-jugs per day, or
twenty-six thousand four hundred and sixty people with beer-jugs,
per week. Then he proceeded to show that a tambourine
and moral degradation were synonymous terms, and a fiddle and
vicious propensities wholly inseparable. All these arguments
he strengthened and demonstrated by frequent references to a
large book with a blue cover, and sundry quotations from the
Middlesex magistrates; and in the end, the corporation, who
were posed with the figures, and sleepy with the speech, and
sadly in want of dinner into the bargain, yielded the palm to
Nicholas Tulrumble, and refused the music licence to the Jolly
Boatmen.</p>

<p class="indent">But although Nicholas triumphed, his triumph was
short. He carried on the war against beer-jugs and fiddles, forgetting
the time when he was glad to drink out of the one, and to
dance to the other, till the people hated, and his old friends
shunned him. He grew tired of the lonely magnificence of
Mudfog Hall, and his heart yearned towards the Lighterman's
Arms. He wished he had never set up as a public man, and
sighed for the good old times of the coal-shop, and the chimney-corner.</p>

<p class="indent">At length old Nicholas, being thoroughly miserable,
took heart of grace, paid the secretary a quarter's wages in advance,
and packed him off to London by the next coach. Having
taken this step, he put his hat on his head, and his pride in his
pocket, and walked down to the old room at the Lighterman's
Arms. There were only two of the old fellows there, and they
looked coldly on Nicholas as he proffered his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you going to put down pipes, Mr. Tulrumble?" said one.</p>

<p class="indent">"Or trace the progress of crime to 'baccer?" growled the other.</p>

<p class="indent">"Neither," replied Nicholas Tulrumble, shaking hands
with them both, whether they would or not. "I've come down to
say that I'm very sorry for having made a fool of myself, and
that I hope you'll give me up the old chair, again."</p>

<p class="indent">The old fellows opened their eyes, and three or four
more old fellows opened the door, to whom Nicholas, with tears in his
eyes, thrust out his hand too, and told the same story. They
raised a shout of joy, that made the bells in the ancient church-tower
vibrate again, and wheeling the old chair into the warm
corner, thrust old Nicholas down into it, and ordered in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
very largest-sized bowl of hot punch, with an unlimited number
of pipes, directly.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day, the Jolly Boatmen got the licence, and
the next night, old Nicholas and Ned Twigger's wife led off a dance
to the music of the fiddle and tambourine, the tone of which
seemed mightily improved by a little rest, for they never had
played so merrily before. Ned Twigger was in the very height
of his glory, and he danced hornpipes, and balanced chairs on
his chin, and straws on his nose, till the whole company, including
the corporation, were in raptures of admiration at the
brilliancy of his acquirements.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Tulrumble, junior, couldn't make up his mind
to be anything but magnificent, so he went up to London and drew
bills on his father; and when he had overdrawn, and got into
debt, he grew penitent and came home again.</p>

<p class="indent">As to old Nicholas, he kept his word, and having had
six weeks of public life, never tried it any more. He went to sleep
in the town-hall at the very next meeting; and, in full proof of
his sincerity, has requested us to write this faithful narrative.
We wish it could have the effect of reminding the Tulrumbles
of another sphere, that puffed-up conceit is not dignity, and that
snarling at the little pleasures they were once glad to enjoy,
because they would rather forget the times when they were of
lower station, renders them objects of contempt and ridicule.</p>

<p class="indent">This is the first time we have published any of our
gleanings from this particular source. Perhaps, at some future period,
we may venture to open the chronicles of Mudfog.</p>

<p class="indent">The "poems of Ossian," a celtic bard, and the "rhymes
of Rowley," a Bristol priest, burst on the public at one and the
same period; when the attention of literary men was for a time
totally absorbed in discussing the respective discoveries of
Macpherson and of Chatterton. "The fashion of this world passeth
away;" and what once engaged so much notice is now sadly
neglected. Indeed, had not Bonaparte taken a fancy to the
ravings of the mad highlander, and had not Chatterton swallowed
oxalic acid, probably far more brief had been the space both
would have occupied in the memory of mankind. In the garret
of Holborn, where the latter expired, the following <i>morceau</i> was
picked up by an Irish housemaid (a native of this parish), who,
in writing home to a sweetheart, converted it into an envelope
for her letter. It thus came into my possession.</p>

<h2>"WHO MILKED MY COW?" OR,<br />THE MARINE GHOST.</h2>
<p class="f110 space-below1">BY THE AUTHOR OF "<b>RATTLIN THE REEFER</b>."</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">Captain the Honourable Augustus Fitzroy Fitzalban,
of that beautiful ship his Majesty's frigate Nænia, loved many things. He loved
his ship truly, and with a perdurable affection; yet he loved something
still more, his very aristocratic self. He had also vowed to
love and cherish another person; but what gallant spirit would yield
love, even if it were as plenty as blackberries, upon compulsion? The
less you give away, the more must remain to be employed in the
service of the possessor. Captain Augustus Fitzroy Fitzalban had a
great deal of unoccupied love at his disposal. Considering duly these
premises, there can be nothing surprising in the fact if he had a
surplus affection or two to dispose of, and that he most ardently
loved new milk every morning for breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Captain the Honourable Augustus Fitzroy Fitzalban&mdash;(how
delightful it is to give the whole title when it is either high-sounding
or euphonous!)&mdash;had large estates and wide pasture-lands populous
with lowing kine. But all these availed him not; for, though he was
sovereign lord and master <i>pro tempore</i> over all as far as the eye
could reach, on the morning of the 6th of June 1826, he could not
command so much of the sky-blueish composition that is sold for milk in
London, as could be bought for one halfpenny in that sovereign city
of many pumps. The fields spread around the honourable captain
were wide and green enough, but, alas! they were not pastured with
mammiferous animals. Neptune has never been known to take
cream to his chocolate and coffee. He would scorn to be called a
milk-and-water gentlemen. There is the sea-cow certainly, but we
never heard much respecting the quality of her butter.</p>

<p class="indent">We are careful. We will not lay ourselves open to animadversion.
We have read books. We have seen things. Therefore we cannot suffer
the little triumph to the little critics who were just going to tell
us that all the cetaceous tribes suckle their young. We can tell these
critics more than they know themselves. Whale's milk <i>is</i> good for
the <i>genus homo</i>. We know two brawny fellows, maintop-men, who,
being cast overboard when infants, were, like Romulus and Remus
with their she-bear, suckled by a sperm-whale; and, when their huge
wet-nurse wished to wean them, she cast them ashore on one of the
Friendly Islands. We think that we hear the incredulous exclaim,
"Very like a whale!" Why, so it was.</p>

<p class="indent">But to return to another matter of history. On the memorable
morning before indicated, the honourable captain, the first lieutenant,
the doctor, the marine officer, the officer and the midshipman of the
morning watch, had all assembled to breakfast in the cabin. They had
not forgotten their appetites, particularly the gentlemen of the
morning watch. They were barbarous and irate in their hunger, as
their eyes wandered over cold fowl and ham, hot rolls, grilled kidneys,
and devilled legs of turkey.</p>

<p class="indent">"By all the stars in heaven," said the honourable commander,
"no milk again this morning! Give me, you rascally steward," continued
the captain, "a plain, straightforward, categorical answer.
Why does this infernal cow, for which I gave such a heap of dollars,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
give me no milk?"&mdash;"Well, sir," said the trembling servitor; "if,
sir, you must have a plain answer, I really&mdash;believe&mdash;it is&mdash;
because&mdash;I don't know."</p>

<p class="indent">"A dry answer," said the doctor, who was in most
senses a dry fellow.</p>

<p class="indent">"You son of a shotten herring!" said the captain,
"can you milk her?"&mdash;"Yes, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then why, in the name of all that is good,
don't you?"&mdash;"I do, sir, but it won't come."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then let us go," said the captain, quite resignedly, "let
us go, gentlemen, and see what ails this infernal cow; I can't eat my breakfast
without milk, and breakfast is the meal that I generally enjoy most."</p>

<p class="indent">So he, leading the way, was followed by his company,
who cast many a longing, lingering look behind.</p>

<p class="indent">Forward they went to where the cow was <i>stalled</i> by
capstan-bars, as comfortably as a prebendary, between two of the guns on the
main-deck. She seemed in excellent condition; ate her nutritious
food with much appetite; and, from her appearance, the captain
might have very reasonably expected, not only an ample supply of
milk and cream for breakfast and tea, but also a sufficient quantity to
afford him custards for dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, there stood the seven officers of his Majesty's naval
service round the arid cow, looking very like seven wise men just put to sea
in a bowl.</p>

<p class="indent">"Try again," said the captain to his servant. If the attempt
had been only fruitless, there had been no matter for wonder;
it was milkless.</p>

<p class="indent">"The fool can't milk," said the captain; then turning round
to his officers despondingly, he exclaimed, "gentlemen, can any of you?"</p>

<p class="indent">Having all protested that they had left off, some thirty,
some forty, and some fifty years, according to their respective ages, and the
marine officer saying that he never had had any practice at all,
having been brought up by hand, the gallant and disappointed hero
was obliged to order the boatswain's mates to pass the word fore and
aft, to send every one to him who knew how to milk a cow.</p>

<p class="indent">Seventeen Welshmen, sixty-five Irishmen, (all on board,) and
four lads from Somersetshire made their appearance, moistened their
fingers, and set to work, one after the other; yet there was no milk.</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you think of this, doctor?" said the captain to him,
taking him aside.&mdash;"That the animal has been milked a few hours before."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hah! If I was sure of that. And the cow could have been milked
only by some one who <i>could</i> milk?"&mdash;"The inference seems indisputable."</p>

<p class="indent">The captain turned upon the numerous aspirants for lacteal
honours with no friendly eye, exclaiming sorrowfully, "Too many to flog, too
many to flog. Let us return to our breakfast; though I shall not be
able to eat a morsel or drink a drop. Here, boatswain's-mate, pass
the word round the ship that I'll give five guineas reward to any one
who will tell me who milked the captain's cow."</p>

<p class="indent">The gentleman then all retired to the cabin, and, with the
exception of the captain, incontinently fell upon the good things. Now, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
midshipman of that morning's watch was a certain Mr. Littlejohn,
usually abbreviated into Jack Small. When Jack Small had disposed
of three hot rolls, half a fowl, and a pound of ham, and was handing
in his plate for a well devilled turkey's thigh, his eye fell
compassionately upon his fasting captain, and his heart opening to the
softer emotions as his stomach filled with his host's delicacies,
the latter's want of the milk of the cow stirred up within him his
own milk of human kindness.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am very sorry that you have no appetite," said Jack Small,
with his mouth very full, and quite protectingly, to his skipper; "very
sorry, indeed, sir: and, as you cannot make your breakfast without
any milk, I think, sir, that the midshipmen's berth could lend you a
bottle."</p>

<p class="indent">"The devil they can, younker. Oh, oh! It's good and fresh, hey?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Very good and fresh, sir," said the midshipman,
ramming down the words with a large wadding of hot roll.</p>

<p class="indent">"We must borrow some of it, by all means," said the captain;
"but let the midshipmen's servant bring it here himself."</p>

<p class="indent">The necessary orders having been issued, the bottle
of milk and the boy appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you know," said Captain Fitzalban, turning to his
first lieutenant, "that the midshipmen's berth was provided with milk, and
that too after being at sea a month?"&mdash;"Indeed I did not; they are
better provided than we are, at least in this respect, in the ward-room."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you think,&mdash;do you think," said the captain, trembling
with rage, "that any of the young blackguards dare milk my cow?"&mdash;"It
is not easy to say what they dare not do."</p>

<p class="indent">However, the cork was drawn, and the milk found not only
to be very fresh indeed, but most suspiciously new. In the latitude of the
Caribbean Islands liquids in general are sufficiently warm, so the captain
could not lay much stress upon that.</p>

<p class="indent">"As fine milk as ever I tasted," said the captain.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very good indeed, sir," said the midshipman, overflowing
his cup and saucer with the delicious liquid.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where do the young gentlemen procure it?" resumed the
captain, pouring very carefully what remained after the exactions of John
Small into the cream-jug, and moving it close to his own plate.&mdash;"It
stands us rather dear, sir," said Mr. Littlejohn,&mdash;"a dollar a bottle.
We buy it of Joe Grummet, the captain of the waisters."</p>

<p class="indent">The captain and first lieutenant
looked at each other unutterable things.</p>

<p class="indent">Joe Grummet was in the cabin in an instant, and the captain
bending upon him his sharp and angry glances. Joseph was a sly old file,
a seaman to the backbone; and let the breeze blow from what quarter
of the compass it would, he had always an eye to windward. Fifty
years had a little grizzled his strong black hair, and, though innovation
had deprived him of the massive tail that whilome hung behind,
there were still some fancy curls that corkscrewed themselves
down his weather-stained temples; and, when he stood before the
captain, in one of these he hitched the first bend of the immense
fore-finger of his right hand. He hobbled a little in his gait, owing to an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
unextracted musket-ball that had lodged in his thigh; consequently
he never went aloft; and had been, for his merits and long services,
appointed captain of the waist.</p>

<p class="indent">The Honorable Augustus Fitzroy Fitzalban said to the veteran
mariner quickly, and pointing at the same time to the empty bottle,
"Grummet, you have milked my cow."&mdash;"Unpossible, sir," said
Grummet, bashing at a bow; "downright unpossible, your honour."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then, pray, whence comes the fresh milk you sell every morning
to the young gentlemen?"&mdash;"Please your honour, I took two or three
dozen of bottles to sea with me on a kind o' speculation."</p>

<p class="indent">"Grummet, my man, I am afraid this will turn out a bad one for
you. Go and show your hands to the doctor, and he'll ask you a few questions."</p>

<p class="indent">So Joseph Grummet went and expanded his flippers before
the eyes of the surgeon. They were nearly as large and as shapely as
the fins of a porpoise, and quite of the colour. They had been
tanned and tarred till their skin had become more durable than
bootleather, and they were quite rough enough to have rasped
close-grained wood.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't think our friend could have milked your cow,
Captain Fitzalban," said the doctor; "at least, not with his hands: they
are rather calculated to draw blood than milk."</p>

<p class="indent">Joseph rolled his eyes about and looked his innocence most
pathetically. He was not yet quite out of danger.</p>

<p class="indent">Now there was every reason in the world why this cow should
give the captain at least a gallon of milk per diem&mdash;but one, and
that he was most anxious to discover. The cow was in the best
condition; since she had been embarked, the weather had been fine
enough to have pleased Europa herself; she had plenty of provender,
both dry and fresh. There were fragrant clover closely packed in
bags, delicious oat-cakes&mdash;meal and water, and fine junks of juicy
plantain.&mdash;The cow throve, but gave no milk!</p>

<p class="indent">"So you brought a few dozen bottles of milk to sea with
you as a venture?" continued the man of medicine in his examination.&mdash;"I
did, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"And where did you procure them?"&mdash;"At English Harbour, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"May I ask of whom?"&mdash;"Madame Juliana, the fat free Negro woman."</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, my man," said the doctor, looking a volume and a half
of Galen, and holding up a cautionary fore-finger&mdash;"now, my man, do
not hope to deceive <i>me</i>. How did you prevent the acetous
fermentation from taking place in these bottles of milk?"</p>

<p class="indent">The question certainly was a puzzler. Joe routed with his
fingers among his hair for an answer. At length he fancied he perceived
a glimmering of the doctor's meaning; so he hummed and
ha-ed, until, the doctor's patience being exhausted, he repeated more
peremptorily, "How did you prevent acetous fermentation taking
place in these bottles of milk?"</p>

<p class="indent">"By paying ready money for them, sir,"
said the badgered seaman boldly.</p>

<p class="indent">"An excellent preventative against fermentation certainly,"
said the captain half smiling. "But you answer the doctor like a fool."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"I was never accused of such a thing, please your honour,
before, sir," said tarrybrecks, with all his sheets and tacks abroad.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very likely, my man, very likely," answered the captain,
with a look that would have been invaluable in a vinegar manufactory.
"How did you prevent this milk from turning sour?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, sir!" said Grummet, now wide awake to his danger:
"if you please, sir, I humbly axes your pardon, but that's my secret."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then by all that's glorious I'll flog it out of you!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I humbly hopes not, sir. I am sure your honour won't
flog an old seaman who has fought with Howe and Nelson, and who was
wounded in the sarvice before your honour was born; you won't flog
him, sir, only because he can't break his oath."</p>

<p class="indent">"So you have sworn not to divulge it, hey?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, sir: if I might be so bold as to say so,
your honour's a witch!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Take care of yourself, Joseph Grummet; I do advise you to
take care of yourself. Folly is a great betrayer of secrets, Joseph. Cunning
may milk cows without discovery: however, I will never punish
without proof. How many bottles of this excellent milk have you yet
left?"&mdash;"Eight or ten, sir, more or less, according to sarcumstances."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well! I will give you a dollar a-piece for all you have."</p>

<p class="indent">At this proposition Joseph Grummet shuffled about, not at
all at his ease, now looking very sagacious, now very foolish, till, at last,
he brought down his features to express the most deprecating humility
of which their iron texture was capable, and he then whined
forth, "I would not insult you, sir, by treating you all as one as a
midshipman. No, your honour: I knows the respect that's due to
you,&mdash;I couldn't think of letting you, sir, have a bottle under three
dollars&mdash;it wouldn't be at all respectful like."</p>

<p class="indent">"Grummet," said Captain Fitzalban, "you are not only
a thorough seaman, but a thorough knave. Now, have you the conscience to
make me pay three dollars a bottle for my own milk?"&mdash;"Ah, sir,
you don't know how much the secret has cost me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Nor do you know how dearly it may cost you yet."</p>

<p class="indent">Joseph Grommet then brought into the cabin his remaining
stock in trade, which, instead of eight or ten, was found to consist only of
two bottles. The captain, though with evident chagrin, paid for them
honourably; and whilst the milkman <i>pro temp.</i> was knotting up
the six dollars in the tie of the handkerchief about his neck, the
skipper said to him, "Now, my man, since we part such good friends,
tell me your candid opinion concerning this cow of mine?"&mdash;"Why, sir,
I thinks as how it's the good people as milks her."</p>

<p class="indent">"The good people! who the devil are they?"&mdash;"The
fairies, your honour."</p>

<p class="indent">"And what do they do with it?"&mdash;"Very few can tell,
your honour; but those who gets it are always desarving folks."</p>

<p class="indent">"Such as old wounded seamen, and captains of the waist
especially. Well, go along to your duty. Look out! <i>cats</i> love milk."</p>

<p class="indent">So Joseph Grummet went forth from the cabin shrugging up his
shoulders, with an ominous presentiment of scratches upon them. The
captain, the Honourable Augustus Fitzroy Fitzalban, gave the marine
officer orders to place a sentry night and day over his cow, and then
dismissed his guests.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The honourable commander was, for the rest of day, in a
most unconscionable ill humour. The ship's sails were beautifully trimmed,
the breeze was just what it ought to have been. The heavens above,
and the waters below, were striving to outsmile each other. What
then made the gallant captain so miserable? He was thinking only
of the temerity of the man who had dared to <i>milk his cow</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The first lieutenant touched his hat most respectfully to
the Honourable Captain Augustus Fitzroy Fitzalban, and acquainted him
that the sun indicated it to be twelve o'clock.</p>

<p class="indent">"Milk my cow!" said the captain abstractedly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Had not that better be postponed till to-morrow morning,
Captain Fitzalban?" said the lieutenant, with a very little smile; "and
in the mean time may we strike the bell, and pipe to dinner?"</p>

<p class="indent">The captain gazed upon the gallant officer sorrowfully, and,
as he shook his head, his looks said as plainly as looks could speak, and
with the deepest pathos, "They never milked <i>his</i> cow."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do what is necessary," at last he uttered; then, pulling
his hat more over his eyes, he continued to pace the quarter-deck.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, though the Honourable Captain Augustus Fitzroy
Fitzalban was the younger son of a nobleman, and enjoyed a very handsome
patrimony, and his temper had been thoroughly spoiled by that process
that is too often called education, yet his heart was sound, English,
and noble. He revolted from doing an unjust action; yet he
smarted dreadfully under the impression that he was cheated and
laughed at to his very face. He did not think that Joseph Grummet
had milked his cow, but he felt assured that the same milk-dealing
Joseph knew who did; yet was he too humane to introduce the Inquisition
on board his ship by extracting the truth by torture.</p>

<p class="indent">The Honourable Captain Fitzroy Fitzalban slept late on the
succeeding morning. He had been called at daylight, <i>pro forma</i>, but
had merely turned from his left side to the right, muttering something
about a cow. It must be supposed that the slumbers of the
morning indemnified him for the horrors of the night, for breakfast
was on the table, and the usual guests assembled, when the captain
emerged from the after-cabin.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no occasion to ask the pale and trembling
steward if the cow had given any milk that morning.</p>

<p class="indent">The breakfast remained untouched by the captain, and passed
off in active silence by his guests. Not wishing to excite more of the
derision of Jack than was absolutely necessary, the Honourable the
Captain Augustus Fitzroy Fitzalban, when he found that the various
officers whom he had invited to breakfast had sufficiently "improved
the occasion," as the methodists say, turned to the first lieutenant,
who was again his guest, and asked him if nothing had transpired on
the over-night to warrant a suspicion as to the lacteal felony.</p>

<p class="indent">The first luff looked very mysterious, and not wholly disposed
to be communicative upon the subject. He had been piously brought up,
and was not at all inclined to be sarcastic upon the score of visions or
the visited of ghosts; yet, at the same time, he did not wish to subject
himself to the ridicule of his captain, who had rationally enough
postponed his belief in apparitions until he had seen one. Under
these difficulties, he replied hesitatingly, that a ghost had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
reported as having "come on board before daylight in the morning,
without leave."</p>

<p class="indent">"A ghost, Mr. Mitchell, come on board, and I not called!" said
the indignant captain: "By G&mdash;, sir, I would have turned out a guard
of honour to have received him! I would have sooner had a visit
from his spirituality than from his Excellency the Spanish
Ambassador.&mdash;The service, sir, has come to a pretty pass, when a ghost
can come on board, and leave the ship too, I presume, without even so
much as the boatswain to pipe the side. So the ghost came, I suppose,
and milked my cow?"</p>

<p class="indent">The first lieutenant, in answer, spoke with all manner of
humility. He represented that he had been educated as a seaman and as an
officer, and not for a doctor of divinity; therefore he could not pretend
to account for these preternatural visitations. He could only
state the fact, and that not so well as the first lieutenant of marines.
"He begged, therefore, to refer to him."</p>

<p class="indent">That officer was immediately sent for, and he made his
appearance accompanied by one of the serjeants, and then it was asserted that,
when the guard went round to relieve the sentries, they found the
man who had been stationed over the cow, lying on the deck senseless
in a fit, and his bayonet could nowhere be found. When by the means
of one of the assistant-surgeons, who had been immediately summoned,
he had been sufficiently recovered to articulate, all the explanation
they could get from him was, that he had seen a ghost; and the
very mention of the fact, so great was his terror, had almost caused a
relapse.</p>

<p class="indent">"Send the poltroon here immediately: I'll ghost him!"
cried the enraged captain. In answer to this he was informed, that the man
lay seriously ill in his hammock in the sick-bay, and that the doctor
was at that very moment with the patient.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll see him myself," said the captain.</p>

<p class="indent">As the honourable captain, with his <i>cortège</i> of officers,
passed along the decks on his way to the sick-bay, he thought&mdash;or his sense
of hearing most grievously deceived him&mdash;that more than once he
heard sneering and gibing voices exclaim, "Who milked my cow?"
but the moment he turned his head in the direction from whence the
sounds proceeded, he saw nothing but visages the most sanctimonious:
indeed they, instead of the unfortunate sentry, appeared to have
seen the ghost. The captain's amiability that morning might have
been expressed by the algebraical term&mdash;minus a cipher.</p>

<p class="indent">When the skipper hauled alongside the sick man, he found
that the doctor, having bled him, was preparing to blister his head, the
ship's barber at the time being occupied in very sedulously shaving it.
The patient was fast putting himself upon an equality to contend
with his supernatural visitant, by making a ghost of himself. He was
in a high fever and delirious,&mdash;unpleasant things in the West Indies!
All the captain could get from him was, "The devil&mdash;flashes of fire&mdash;milk
cow&mdash;horrible teeth&mdash;devil's cow&mdash;ship haunted&mdash;nine yards of
blue flame&mdash;throw cow overboard&mdash;go to heaven&mdash;kicked the pail
down&mdash;horns tipped with red-hot iron," and other rhapsodies to the same effect.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">From the man the captain went to the cow; but she was
looking excessively sleek, and mild, and amiable, and eating her breakfast
with the relish of an outside mail-coach passenger. The captain
shook his head, and thought himself the most persecuted of beings.</p>

<p class="indent">When this self-estimated injured character gained the
quarter-deck, he commenced ruminating on the propriety of flogging Joseph
Grummet; for, with the loss of his cow's milk, he had lost all due
sense of human kindness. But, as the Lords of the Admiralty had
lately insisted upon a report being forwarded to them of every punishment
that took place, the number of lashes, and the crime for which
they were inflicted, the Honourable the Captain Augustus Fitzroy
Fitzalban thought that a report would look rather queer running thus:
"Joseph Grummet, captain of the waist, six dozen, because my cow
gave no milk," or "because private-marine Snickchops saw a ghost,"
or "for selling the midshipmen sundry bottles of milk;" and this last
imagination reminded him that there was one of this highly-gifted
class walking to leeward of him. "Mr. Littlejohn!" said the captain
with a voice that crawled over the nerves like the screeching of an
ill-filed saw.</p>

<p class="indent">Small Jack touched his hat with more than usual respect to the
exasperated officer, and then, stepping to windward, humbly confronted him.</p>

<p class="indent">The captain was too angry for many words; so, looking fearfully
into the happy countenance of the reefer, and pointing his fore-finger
down perpendicularly, he laconically uttered, "Milk this morning?"&mdash;"Yes, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Good?"</p>

<p class="indent">The well-breakfasted midshipman licked his lips, and smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">"Grummet?"&mdash;"Yes, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell the boatswain's mate to send him aft."&mdash;"Ay, ay, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">And there stood the captain of the waist, with his hat in his
hand, opposite to the captain of the ship. There was some difference between
those two captains:&mdash;one verging upon old age, the other
upon manhood. The old man with but two articles of dress upon his
person, a canvass shirt and a canvass pair of trousers,&mdash;for in those
latitudes shoes and stockings are dispensed with by the foremast
men, excepting on Sundays and when mustering at divisions; the
other gay, and almost gorgeous, in white jeans, broad-cloth, and gold.
There they stood, the one the personification of meekness, the other
of haughty anger. However firm might have been the captain's intentions
to convict the man before him by an intricate cross-examination,
his warmth of temper defeated them at once, for the old seaman
looked more than usually innocent and sheepish. This almost
stolid equanimity was sadly provoking.</p>

<p class="indent">"You insolent scoundrel!&mdash;who milked my cow last
night?"&mdash; "The Lord in heaven knows, your honour. Who could it be, sir,
without it was the ghost who has laid that poor lad in his sick hammock?"</p>

<p class="indent">"And I suppose that the ghost ordered you to hand the milk to
the young gentlemen when he had done?"&mdash;"Me, sir! Heaven
save me! I never se'ed a ghost in my life."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hypocrite! the bottle you sold the midshipmen!"&mdash;"One,
your honour, I brought from Antigua, and which I overlooked yesterday."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"I shall not overlook it when I get you to the gangway.
Go, Mr. Littlejohn, give orders to beat to quarters the moment the men have
had their time."</p>

<p class="indent">All that forenoon the captain kept officers and men
exercising the great guns, running them in and out, pointing them here and
there;&mdash;sail-trimmers aloft&mdash;boarders on the starboard bow&mdash;firemen
down in the fore-hold: the men had not a moment's respite, nor the officers
either. How potently in their hearts they d&mdash;d the cow, even from
the tips of her horns unto the tuft at the end of her tail! Five secret
resolves were made to poison her that hard-worked morning. Mr.
Small Jack, who was stationed at the foremost main-deck guns near
her, gave her a kick every time the order came from the quarter-deck
to ram home wad and shot.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, this sweltering work, under a tropical sun, proceeded
till noon, the captain alternately swearing at the officers for want of
energy, and exclaiming to himself indignantly, "D&mdash;them! how
dare they milk my cow! There must be several concerned. Send
the carpenter aft. Mr. Wedge, rig both the chain-pumps,&mdash;turn the
water on in the well. Waisters! man the pumps. Where's that
Grummet? Boatswain's mates, out with your colts and lay them
over the shoulders of any man that shirks his duty; keep a sharp
eye on the captain of the waist."</p>

<p class="indent">And thus the poor fellows had, for a finish to their morning's
labour, a half-hour of the most overpowering exertion to which you
can set mortal man,&mdash;that of working at the chain-pumps. When Mr.
Littlejohn saw elderly Joseph Grummet stripped to the waist, the
perspiration streaming down him in bucket-fulls, and panting as it
were for his very life, he, the said Small Jack, very rightly opined
that no milk would be forthcoming next morning.</p>

<p class="indent">At noon the men were as usual piped to dinner, with an excellent
appetite for their pork and pease, and a thirsty relish for their grog;
for which blessings they had the cow alone to thank. They were very ungrateful.</p>

<p class="indent">No sooner was the hour of dinner over than the captain all of a
sudden discovered that his ship's company were not smart enough in
reefing topsails. So at it they went, racing up and down the rigging,
tricing up and laying out, lowering away and hoisting, until six bells,
three o'clock, when the angry and hungry captain went to his dinner.
He had made himself more unpopular in that day than any other
commander in the fleet.</p>

<p class="indent">The dinner was unsocial enough. When a man is not satisfied
with himself, it is rarely that he is satisfied with any body else. Now
the whole ship's company, officers as well as men, were divided into
parties, and into only two, respecting this affair of the cow; one believed
in a supernatural, the other in a roguish agency; in numbers
they were about equal, so that the captain stood in the pleasant predicament
of being looked upon in a sinful light by one half of his
crew, and in a ludicrous one by the other.</p>

<p class="indent">However, as the night advanced, and the marine who had
seen the cow-spirit grew worse, the believers in the supernatural increased
rapidly; and as one sentinel was found unwilling to go alone, the cow
had the distinguished compliment of a guard of honour of two all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
night. The captain, with a scornful defiance of the spiritual, would
allow of no lights to be shown, or of no extraordinary precautions to
be taken. He only signified his intentions of having himself an interview
with the ghost, and for that purpose he walked the deck till
midnight; but the messenger from the land of spirits did not choose
to show himself so early.</p>

<p class="indent">Let me hear no more any querulous talk of the labour of
getting butter to one's bread&mdash;no person could have toiled more than
the Honourable Captain Augustus Fitzroy Fitzalban to get milk for his
breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">The two sentries were relieved at twelve o'clock, and, for a
quarter of an hour after, everything remaining dark and quiet about the
haunted cow, the captain went below and turned in, joyfully anticipative
of milk and cream in the morning. He left, of course, the
most positive orders that the moment the ghost appeared he should
be called.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mitchell, the pious first lieutenant, remained on deck,
determined to see the sequel; told the master he was much troubled in
spirit, and he thought, with all due deference to the articles of war,
and respect for the captain, that he was little better than an infidel,
and an overbold tempter of God's providence. The master remarked
in reply that it was an affair entirely out of soundings; but very sagely
concluded that they should see what they should see, even if they
saw nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a beautiful night, darkly, yet, at the same time,
brightly beautiful. There was no moon. The pure fires above were like
scintillations from the crown of God's glory. Though the heavens
were thus starred with splendours, it was deeply, though clearly,
dark on the ocean. There was a gentle breeze that was only sufficient
to make the sails draw, and the noble frigate walked stately,
yet majestically onwards.</p>

<p class="indent">Forward on the main-deck the darkness was Cimmerian. When
lights had been last there at the relieving of the sentinels, the cow
had laid herself quietly down upon her litter, and seemed to be in a
profound sleep; the first hour after midnight was passed, and all was
hushed as death, save those noises that indicate what else would be
absolute silence more strongly. There was the whispering ripple of
the sea, the dull creaking of the tiller-ropes, and the stealthy step of
the sentinels: these sounds, and these only, were painfully distinct.
One bell struck, and its solemn echoes seemed to creep through the
decks as if on some errand of death, and the monotonous cry of the
look-outs fell drearily on the ear.</p>

<p class="indent">The first lieutenant and the officers of the watch had just
begun to shake off their dreamy and fearful impressions, to breathe more freely,
and to walk the deck with a firmer tread, when, from what was
supposed to be the haunted spot, a low shriek was heard, then a
bustle, followed by half-stifled cries of "The guard! the guard!"</p>

<p class="indent">The officers of the watch jumped down on to the main-deck,
the midshipmen rushed into the cabin to call the captain, and men with
and without lights rushed forward to the rescue.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Deep in the darkness of the manger there glared an apparition
that might more than justify the alarm. The spot where the phantom
was seen, (we pledge ourselves that we are relating facts,) was
that part of a frigate which seamen call "the eyes of her," directly
under the foremost part of the forecastle, where the cables run
through the hawse-holes, and through which the bowsprit trends upwards.
The whole place is called the manger. It is very often appropriated
to the use of pigs until they take their turn for the butcher's
knife. This was the strange locality that the ghost chose to
honour with its dreadful presence.</p>

<p class="indent">From the united evidences of the many who saw this ghastly
avatar, it appeared only to have thrust its huge head and a few feet of the
forepart of its body through the hawse-hole, the remainder of its
vast and voluminous tail hanging out of the ship over its bows. The
frightful head and the sockets of its eyes were distinctly
marked in lineaments of fire. Its jaws were stupendous, and its triple
row of sharp and long-fanged teeth seemed to be gnashing for something
mortal to devour. It cast a pale blue halo of light around it,
just sufficient to show the outlines of the den it had selected in which
to make its unwelcome appearance. Noise it made none, though several
of the spectators fancied that they heard a gibbering of unearthly
sounds; and Mr. Littlejohn swore the next day upon his John
Hamilton Moore, that it mooed dolefully like a young bullock crossed
in love.</p>

<p class="indent">To describe the confusion on the main-deck, whilst officers,
seamen, and marines were gazing on this spectre, so like the fiery spirit of
the Yankee sea-serpent, is a task from which I shrink, knowing that language
cannot do it adequately. The first lieutenant stood in the
middle of the group, not merely transfixed, but paralysed with fear;
men were tumbling over each other, shouting, praying, swearing. Up
from the dark holds, like shrouded ghosts, the watch below, in their
shirts, sprang from their hammocks; and for many, one look was
enough, and the head would vanish immediately in the dark profound.
The shouting for lights, and loaded muskets and pistols was terrible;
and the orders to advance were so eagerly reiterated, that none had
leisure to obey them.</p>

<p class="indent">But the cow herself did not present the least imposing feature
in this picture of horror. She formed, as it were, the barrier between
mortality and spirituality&mdash;all beyond her was horrible and spectral; by
her fright she seemed to acknowledge the presence of a preternatural
being. Her legs were stiff and extended, her tail standing out like
that of an angered lion, and she kept a continued strain upon the halter
with which she was tethered to a ring-bolt in the ship's side.</p>

<p class="indent">By this time several of the ward-room officers, and most
of the midshipmen, had reached the scene of action. Pistols were no longer
wanting, and loaded ones too. Three shots were fired into the manger,
with what aim it is impossible to specify, at the spectre. They did
not seem to annoy his ghostship in the least; without an indication of
his beginning to grow hungry, might be deemed so. As the shot
whistled past him, he worked his huge and fiery jaws most ravenously.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," said the second lieutenant, "let us give the
gentleman another shot, and then come to close quarters. Mr. Mitchell, you
have a pistol in your hand: fire!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"In the name of the Holy Trinity!" said the superstitious first,
"there!" Bang! and the shot took effect deep in the loins of the unfortunate cow.</p>

<p class="indent">At this precise moment, Captain the Honourable Augustus
Fitzroy Fitzalban rushed from his cabin forward, attired in a rich flowered
silk morning-gown, in which scarlet predominated. He held a pistol
cocked in each hand; and, as he broke through the crowd, he bellowed
forth lustily, "Where's the ghost! let me see the ghost!" He was
soon in the van of the astonished gazers; but, disappointed Fitzalban!
he saw no ghost, because, as the man says in the Critic, "'twas not
in sight."</p>

<p class="indent">Immediately the honourable captain had gained his station,
the much wronged and persecuted cow, galled by her wound, with a
mortal effort snapped the rope with which she was fastened, and then
lowering her horned head nearly level with the deck, and flourishing
her tail after the manner that an Irishman flourishes his shillelagh
before he commences occipital operations, she rushed upon the
crowded phalanx before her. At this instant, as if its supernatural
mission had been completed, the spirit vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">The ideal having decamped, those concerned had to save
themselves from the well followed up assaults of the real. The captain
flew before the pursuing horns, d&mdash;ning the cow in all the varieties
of condemnation. But she was generous, and she attached herself to
him with an unwonted, or rather an unwanted, fidelity. Lanterns
were crushed and men overthrown, and laughter now arose amidst
the shouts of dismay. The seamen tried to impede the progress
of the furious animal by throwing down before her lashed-up hammocks,
and by seizing her behind by the tail: but, woe is me! the
Honourable the Captain Augustus Fitzroy Fitzalban could not run so
fast in his variegated and scarlet flowered silk dressing-gown as a
cow in the agonies of death; for he had just reached that asylum
of safety, his cabin-door, when the cow took him up very carefully
with her horns, and first giving him a monitory shake, then with
an inclination to port, she tossed him right over the ward-room
skylight, and deposited him very gingerly in the turtle-tub that stood
lashed on the larboard side of the half-deck. This exertion was her
last; for immediately alter falling upon her knees, and then gently
rolling over, to use an Homeric expression, her soul issued from
her wound, and sought the shades below appropriated to the souls
of cows.</p>

<p class="indent">In the mean time, the captain was sprawling about, and
contending with his turtle for room, and he stood a very good chance of
being drowned even in a tub; but assistance speedily arriving, he was
drawn out, and thus the world was spared a second tale of a tub.
But there was something in the spirit of the aristocratic Fitzalban
that neither cows, ghosts, nor turtle-haunted water could subdue.
Wet as he was, and suffering also from the contusions of the cow's
horns, he immediately ordered more light, and proceeded to search
for the ghost,&mdash;prolific parent of all his mishaps.</p>

<p class="indent">Well escorted he visited the manager, but the most
scrutinising search could discover nothing extraordinary. The place seemed
to have been undisturbed, nor once to have departed from its usual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
solitariness and dirt. There was not even so much as a smell
of sulphur on the spot where the spectre had appeared, nor were
there any signs of wet, which, supposing the thing seen had been
a real animal, would have been the case, had it come from the
sea through one of the hawse-holes. The whole affair was involved
in the most profound mystery. The honourable captain, therefore,
came to the conclusion that nothing whatever had appeared, and
that the whole was the creation of cowardice.</p>

<p class="indent">Hot with rage and agueish with cold, he retired to
his cabin, vowing all manner of impossible vengeance, muttering about
courts-martial, and solemnly protesting that Mr. Mitchell, the first
lieutenant, should pay him for the cow that he had so wantonly shot.</p>

<p class="indent">Blank were the countenances of many the next morning.
The first lieutenant was not, as usual, asked to breakfast. There was
distrust and division in his Majesty's ship Nænia, and the Honourable
the Captain Augustus Fitzroy Fitzalban had several severe contusions
on his noble person, a bad cold, and no milk for breakfast;
an accumulation of evils that one of the aristocracy ought not
to be obliged to bear. Though Mr. Mitchell did not breakfast
with the captain, Jack Small, alias Small Jack, alias Mr. Littlejohn,
did. The only attempt of the captain that morning at conversation
was as follows. With a voice that croaked like a raven's at the
point of death, evidence <i>externe</i> of an abominable sore-throat, the
captain merely said to the reefer, pointing his fore-finger downwards
as he did the day before, "<i>Milk?</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Littlejohn shook his head dolefully,
and replied, "No, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"My cow died last night," said the afflicted commander
with a pathos that would have wrung the heart of a stone statue&mdash;if it
could have heard it.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you please, sir," said the steward, "Mr. Mitchell
sends his compliments, and would be very glad to know what you would have
done with the dead cow."&mdash;"My compliments to Mr. Mitchell and
<i>he</i> may do whatever he likes with it. He shot it, and must pay
me for it: let him eat it if he will."</p>

<p class="indent">The first lieutenant and the captain were, after this,
not on speaking terms for three months. Several duels had very nearly
been fought about the ghost; those who had not seen it, branding
those who had with an imputation only a little short of cowardice;
those who had seen it, becoming for a few weeks very religious,
and firmly resolving henceforward to get drunk only in pious company.
The carcase of the cow was properly dressed and cut up,
but few were found who would eat of it; the majority of the seamen
thinking that the animal had been bewitched: the captain of
course would take none of it unless Mr. Mitchell would permit
him to pay him for it at so much per pound, as he pertinaciously
pretended to consider it to be the property of the first lieutenant.
Consequently, the animal was neatly shared between
the midshipmen's berth and the mess of which Joseph Grummet,
the captain of the waist, was an unworthy member.</p>

<p class="indent">The day following the death of the cow, Joseph Grummet
was found loitering about the door of the young gentlemen's berth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Any milk to-morrow, Joseph?" said the caterer.&mdash;"No, sir,"
with a most sensible shake of the head.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">"Oh!&mdash;the cow has given up the ghost!"&mdash;"<i>And somebody
else too!</i>" This simple expression seemed to have much relieved Joe's
overcharged bosom: he turned his quid in his month with evident satisfaction,
grinned, and was shortly after lost in the darkness forward.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent space-above1">There never yet was a ghost story that did not prove a very
simple affair when the key to it was found. The captain of the Nænia
never would believe that anything uncommon was ever seen at all.
He was, however, as much in the wrong as those who believed that
they had seen a ghost. The occurrence could not be forgotten,
though it ceased to be talked of.</p>

<p class="indent">Two years after the ship came to England, and was paid off.
Joseph Grummet bagged his notes and his sovereigns with much satisfaction;
but he did not jump like a fool into the first boat, and rush
ashore to scatter his hard-earned wages among Jews, and people still
worse: he stayed till the last man, and anxiously watched for the
moment when the pennant should be hauled down. When he saw
this fairly done, he asked leave to speak to the captain. He was
ushered into the cabin, and he there saw many of the officers who
were taking leave of their old commander.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Grummet," said the skipper, "what now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Please your honour, you offered five guineas to anybody who
would tell you who milked the cow."</p>

<p class="indent">"And so I will gladly," said the captain, pleasantly, "if
the same person will unravel the mystery of the ghost." And he turned a
triumphant look upon the believers in spirits who stood around him.</p>

<p class="indent">"I milked your cow, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! Joseph, Joseph! it was unkindly done. But with your
hands?"&mdash;"We widened a pair of Mr. Littlejohn's kid-gloves, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"I knew that little rascal was at the bottom of it! but
there is honour in the midshipmen's berth still. What is the reason that
they thus sought to deprive me of my property?"&mdash;"You wouldn't
allow them to take any live stock on board that cruise, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"So&mdash;so&mdash;wild justice, hey? But come to the
ghost."&mdash;"Why, sir, I wanted to have the cow unwatched for a quarter of
an hour every middle watch; so I took the shark's head we had caught a day
or two before, scraped off most of the flesh, and whipped it in a
bread-bag,&mdash;it shone brighter in the dark than stinking mackerel;&mdash;so
I whips him out when I wants him, and wabbles his jaws about.
I was safely stowed under the bowsprit from your shot; and when
your honour walked in on one side of the manger, I walked, with my
head under my arm, out of the other."</p>

<p class="indent space-below2">"Well, Joseph, there are your five guineas: and, gentlemen,"
said the Honourable the Captain Augustus Fitzroy Fitzalban, bowing to
his officers, "I wish you joy of your ghost!"

<h2>AN EVENING OF VISITS.</h2>
<p class="f110">BY J. FENIMORE COOPER,&emsp;AUTHOR OF "<b>THE PILOT</b>."</p>

<p class="indent">I have had an odd pleasure in driving from one house
to another on particular evenings, in order to produce as strong
contrasts as my limited visiting list will afford. Having a
fair opportunity a few nights since, in consequence of two or
three invitations coming in for the evening on which several
houses where I occasionally called were opened, I determined to
make a night of it, in order to note the effect. As A&mdash;&mdash; did
not know several of the people, I went alone, and you may possibly
be amused with an account of my adventures: they shall be told.</p>

<p class="indent">In the first place I had to dress, in order to go to
dinner at a house that I had never entered, and with a family of which I
had never seen a soul. These are incidents which frequently
come over a stranger, and, at first, were not a little awkward,
but use hardens us to much greater misfortunes. At six, then,
I stepped punctually into my <i>coupé</i>, and gave Charles the
necessary number and street. I ought to tell you that the invitation
had come a few days before, and, in a fit of curiosity, I
had accepted it, and sent a card, without having the least idea
who my host and hostess were, beyond their names. There
was something piquant in this ignorance, and I had almost
made up my mind to go in the same mysterious manner, leaving
all to events, when happening in an idle moment to ask a
lady of my acquaintance, and for whom I have a great respect,
if she knew a Madame de &mdash;&mdash;, to my surprise her answer was,
"Most certainly&mdash;she is my cousin, and you are to dine there
to-morrow." I said no more, though this satisfied me that my
hosts were people of some standing. While driving to their
hotel, it struck me, under all the circumstances, it might be
well to know more of them; and I stopped at the gate of a
female friend who knows everybody, and who I was certain
would receive me even at that unseasonable hour. I was admitted,
explained my errand, and inquired if she knew a M. de &mdash;&mdash;.
"Quelle question!" she exclaimed; "M. de &mdash;&mdash; est
Chancelier de la France!" Absurd, and even awkward, as it
might have proved but for this lucky thought, I should have
dined with the French Lord High Chancellor without having
the smallest suspicion who he was!</p>

<p class="indent">The hotel was a fine one, though the apartment was
merely good; and the reception, service, and general style of the house
were so simple, that neither would have awakened the least suspicion
of the importance of my hosts. The party was small, and
the dinner modest. I found the <i>Chancelier</i> a grave dignified
man, a little curious on the subject of America; and his wife,
apparently a woman of great good sense, and, I should think,
of a good deal of attainment. Every thing went off in the
quietest manner possible, and I was sorry when it was time to go.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">From this dinner I drove to the hotel of the Marquis
de Marbois, to pay a visit of digestion. M. de Marbois retires
so early on account of his great age, that one is obliged to be
punctual, or he will find the gate locked at nine. The company
had got back into the drawing-room; and as the last week's
guests were mostly there, as well as those who had just left the
table, there might have been thirty people present, all of whom
were men, but two. One of the ladies was Madame de Souza,
known in French literature as the writer of several clever novels
of society. In the drawing-room were grouped in clusters the
Grand Referendary, M. Cuvier, M. Daru, M. Villemain, M. de
Plaisance, Mr. Brown, and many others of note. There seemed
to be something in the wind, as the conversation was in low confidential
whispers, attended by divers ominous shrugs. This
could only be politics; and, watching an opportunity, I questioned
an acquaintance. The fact was really so. The appointed
hour had come, and the ministry of M. de Villèle was in the
agony. The elections had not been favourable, and it was expedient
to make an attempt to reach the <i>old</i> end by what is called a
<i>new</i> combination. It is necessary to understand the general
influence of political intrigues on certain <i>côteries</i> of Paris, to
appreciate the effect of this intelligence on a drawing-room filled
like this, with men who had been actors in the principal events
of France for forty years. The name of M. Cuvier was even
mentioned as one of the new ministers. Comte Roy was also
named as likely to be the new premier. I was told that this
gentleman was one of the greatest landed proprietors of France,
his estates being valued at four millions of dollars. The fact
is curious, as showing, not on vulgar rumour, but from a respectable
source, what is deemed a first-rate landed property
in this country. It is certainly no merit, nor do I believe it is
any very great advantage; but I think we might materially
beat this, even in America. The company soon separated, and
retired.</p>

<p class="indent">From the Place de la Madeleine I drove to a house
near the Carrousel, where I had been invited to step in, in the course
of the evening. All the buildings that remain within the intended
parallelogram, which will some day make this spot one
of the finest squares in the world, have been bought by the
government, or nearly so, with the intent to have them pulled
down at a proper time; and the court bestows lodgings, <i>ad
interim</i>, among them, on its favourites. Madame de &mdash;&mdash; was
one of these favoured persons, and she occupies a small apartment
in the third story of one of these houses. The rooms
were neat and well arranged, but small. Probably the largest
does not exceed fifteen feet square. The approach to a Paris
lodging is usually either very good or very bad. In the new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
buildings may be found some of the mediocrity of the new order
of things; but in all those which were erected previously to the
Revolution, there is nothing but extremes in this as in most other
things,&mdash;great luxury and elegance, or great meanness and
discomfort. The house of Madame de &mdash;&mdash; happens to be of
the latter class; and although all the disagreeables have disappeared
from her own rooms, one is compelled to climb up
to them through a dark well of a staircase, by flights of steps
not much better than those we use in our stables. You have no
notion of such staircases as those I had just descended in the hotels
of the Chancelier and the Premier President;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
nor have we any just idea, as connected with respectable dwellings of these
I had now to clamber up. M. de &mdash;&mdash; is a man of talents
and great respectability, and his wife is exceedingly clever, but
they are not rich. He is a professor, and she is an artist. After
having passed so much of my youth on top-gallant-yards,
and in becketting royals, you are not to suppose, however, I
had any great difficulty in getting up these stairs, narrow,
steep, and winding as they were.</p>

<p class="indent">We are now at the door, and I have rung. On whom do
you imagine the curtain will rise? On a <i>réunion</i> of philosophers
some to discuss questions in botany with M. de &mdash;&mdash;,
or on artists assembled to talk over the troubles of their profession
with his wife? The door opens, and I enter.</p>

<p class="indent">The little drawing-room was crowded; chiefly with men.
Two card-tables were set, and at one I recognised a party, in which
were three dukes of the <i>vieille cour</i>, with M. de Duras at their
head! The rest of the company was a little more mixed; but, on
the whole, it savoured strongly of Coblentz and the <i>émigration</i>.
This was more truly French than anything I had yet stumbled
on. One or two of the grandees looked at me as if, better
informed than Scott, they knew that General La Fayette had
not gone to America to live. Some of these gentlemen certainly
do not love us; but I had cut out too much work for the
night to stay and return the big looks of even dukes, and,
watching an opportunity when the eyes of Madame de &mdash;&mdash; were
another way, I stole out of the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Charles now took his orders, and we drove down into
the heart of the town, somewhere near the general post-office, or
into those mazes of streets that near two years of practice have
not yet taught me to thread. We entered the court of a large
hotel that was brilliantly lighted; and I ascended, by a noble
flight of steps, to the first floor. Ante-chambers communicated
with a magnificent saloon, which appeared to be near forty feet
square. The ceilings were lofty, and the walls were ornamented
with military trophies, beautifully designed, and which had the
air of being embossed and gilded. I had got into the hotel of
one of Napoleon's marshals, you will say, or at least into one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
a marshal of the old <i>régime</i>. The latter conjecture may be
true, but the house is now inhabited by a great woollen manufacturer,
whom the events of the day have thrown into the presence
of all these military emblems. I found the worthy <i>industriel</i>
surrounded by a group, composed of men of his own
stamp, eagerly discussing the recent changes in the government.
The women, of whom there might have been a dozen, were
ranged, like a neglected parterre, along the opposite side of the
room. I paid my compliments, stayed a few minutes, and stole
away to the next engagement.</p>

<p class="indent">We had now to go to a little retired house on the
Champs Elysées. There were only three or four carriages before the
door, and on ascending to a small, but very neat apartment, I
found some twenty people collected. The mistress of the house
was an English lady, single, of a certain age, and a daughter of
the Earl of &mdash;&mdash;, who was once governor of New York. Here
was a very different set: one or two ladies of the old court,
women of elegant manners, and seemingly of good information;
several English women, pretty, quiet, and clever; besides a
dozen men of different nations. This was one of those little
<i>réunions</i> that are so common in Paris among the foreigners, in
which a small infusion of French serves to leaven a considerable
batch of human beings from other parts of the world. As it is
always a relief to me to speak my own language, after being a
good while among foreigners, I stayed an hour at this house.
In the course of the evening an Irishman of great wit and of exquisite
humour, one of the paragons of the age in his way, came
in. In the course of conversation, this gentleman, who is the
proprietor of an Irish estate, and a Catholic, told me of an atrocity
in the laws of his country of which until then I was ignorant.
It seems that any younger brother, or next heir, might
claim the estate by turning Protestant, or drive the incumbent
to the same act. I was rejoiced to hear that there was hardly
an instance of such profligacy known.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
To what baseness will not the struggle for political ascendancy urge us!</p>

<p class="indent">In the course of the evening, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, the Irish
gentleman, gravely introduced me to a Sir James &mdash;&mdash;, adding, with
perfect gravity, "a gentleman whose father humbugged the Pope&mdash;humbugged
infallibility." One could not but be amused with
such an introduction, urged in a way so infinitely droll, and I
ventured, at a proper moment, to ask an explanation, which,
unless I was also humbugged, was as follows.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the <i>détenus</i> in 1804 was Sir William &mdash;&mdash;,
the father of Sir James &mdash;&mdash;, the person in question. Taking advantage
of the presence of the Pope at Paris, he is said to
have called on the good-hearted Pius, with great concern of
manner, to state his case. He had left his sons in England,
and through his absence they had fallen under the care of two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Presbyterian aunts; as a father he was naturally anxious to
rescue them from this perilous situation. "Now, Pius," continued
my merry informant, "quite naturally supposed that all
this solicitude was in behalf of two orthodox Catholic souls, and
he got permission from Napoleon for the return of so good a
father to his own country,&mdash;never dreaming that the conversion
of the boys, if it ever took place, would only be from the Protestant
Episcopal Church of England to that of Calvin; or a
rescue from one of the devil's furnaces to pop them into another."
I laughed at this story, I suppose with a little incredulity;
but my Irish friend insisted on its truth, ending the
conversation with a significant nod, Catholic as he was, and
saying&mdash;"humbugged infallibility!"</p>

<p class="indent">By this time it was eleven o'clock; and as I am obliged to
keep reasonable hours, it was time to go to <i>the</i> party of the
evening. Count &mdash;&mdash;, of the &mdash;&mdash; Legation, gave a great ball.
My carriage entered the line at the distance of near a quarter of
a mile from the hotel; gensdarmes being actively employed in
keeping us all in our places. It was half an hour before I was
set down, and the quadrilles were in full motion when I entered.
It was a brilliant affair,&mdash;much the most so, I have ever
yet witnessed in a private house. Some said there were fifteen
hundred people present. The number seems incredible; and yet,
when one comes to calculate, it may be so. As I got into my
carriage to go away, Charles informed me that the people at the
gates affirm that more than six hundred carriages had entered
the court that evening. By allowing an average of little more
than two to each vehicle, we get the number mentioned.</p>

<p class="indent">I do not know exactly how many rooms were opened on
this occasion, but I should think there were fully a dozen. Two or
three were very large <i>salons</i>; and the one in the centre, which
was almost at fever heat, had crimson hangings, by way of
cooling one. I have never witnessed dancing at all comparable
to that of the quadrilles of this evening. Usually there is either
too much or too little of the dancing-master, but on this occasion
every one seemed inspired with a love of the art. It was a
beautiful sight to see a hundred charming young women, of the
first families of Europe,&mdash;for they were there, of all nations,
dressed with the simple elegance that is so becoming to the young of
the sex, and which is never departed from here until after
marriage,&mdash;moving in perfect time to delightful music, as if
animated by a common soul. The men, too, did better than usual, being
less lugubrious and mournful than our sex is apt to be in dancing.
I do not know how it is in private, but in the world, at
Paris, every young woman seems to have a good mother; or, at
least, one capable of giving her both a good tone and good
taste.</p>

<p class="indent">At this party I met the &mdash;&mdash;, an intimate friend
of the ambassador, and one who also honours me with a portion of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
friendship. In talking over the appearance of things, she told
me that some hundreds of <i>applications for invitations</i> to this
ball had been made. "Applications! I cannot conceive of such
meanness. In what manner?" "Directly; by note, by personal
intercession&mdash;almost by tears. Be certain of it, many
hundreds have been refused." In America we hear of refusals
to go to balls, but we have not yet reached the pass of sending
refusals to invite! "Do you see Mademoiselle &mdash;&mdash;, dancing
in the set before you?" She pointed to a beautiful French girl
whom I had often seen at her house, but whose family was in a
much lower station in society than herself. "Certainly; pray
how came <i>she</i> here?" "I brought her. Her mother was dying
to come, too, and she begged me to get an invitation for her
and her daughter; but it would not do to bring the mother to
such a place, and I was obliged to say no more tickets could be
issued. I wished, however, to bring the daughter, she is so
pretty; and we compromised the affair in that way." "And to
this the mother assented!" "Assented! How can you doubt
it? What funny American notions you have brought with you to France!"</p>

<p class="indent">I got some droll anecdotes from my companion, concerning
the ingredients of the company on this occasion, for she could be as
sarcastic as she was elegant. A young woman near us, attracted
attention by a loud and vulgar manner of laughing. "Do you
know that lady?" demanded my neighbour. "I have seen
her before, but scarcely know her name." "She is the daughter
of your acquaintance, the Marquise de &mdash;&mdash;." "Then she is,
or was, a Mademoiselle de &mdash;&mdash;." "She is not, nor properly
ever was, a Mademoiselle de &mdash;&mdash;. In the Revolution the Marquis
was imprisoned by you wicked republicans, and the Marquise
fled to England, whence she returned, after an absence of three
years, bringing with her this young lady, then an infant a few
months old." "And Monsieur le Marquis?" "He never saw
his daughter, having been beheaded in Paris, about a year
before her birth." "<i>Quel contre-temps!</i>" "<i>N'est-ce pas?</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">It is a melancholy admission, but it is no less true,
that good breeding is sometimes quite as active a virtue as good principles.
How many more of the company present were born about a year
after their fathers were beheaded, I have no means of knowing,
but had it been the case with all of them, the company would
have been of as elegant demeanour, and of much more <i>retenue</i> of
deportment, than we are accustomed to see, I will not say in
<i>good</i>, but certainly in <i>general</i> society, at home. One of
the consequences of good breeding is also a disinclination, positively
a distaste, to pry into the private affairs of others. The little
specimen to the contrary, just named, was rather an exception,
owing to the character of the individual, and to the indiscretion
of the young lady in laughing too loud; and then the affair of a
birth so <i>very</i> posthumous was rather too <i>patent</i> to
escape all criticism.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">My friend was in a gossiping mood this evening, and,
as she was well turned of fifty, I ventured to continue the conversation.
As some of the <i>liaisons</i> which exist here must be novel to you,
I shall mention one or two more.</p>

<p class="indent">A Madame de J&mdash;&mdash; passed us, leaning on the arm
of M. de C&mdash;&mdash;. I knew the former, who was a widow; had frequently
visited her, and had been surprised at the intimacy which
existed between her, and M. de C&mdash;&mdash;, who always appeared
quite at home in her house. I ventured to ask my neighbour if
the gentleman were the brother of the lady. "Her brother! It
is to be hoped not, as he is her husband." "Why does she not
bear his name, if that be the case?" "Because her first husband
is of a more illustrious family than her second; and then there
are some difficulties on the score of fortune. No, no. These
people are <i>bonâ fide</i> married. <i>Tenez</i>&mdash;do you see that
gentleman who is standing so assiduously near the chair of Madame
de S&mdash;&mdash;? He who is all attention and smiles to the lady?"
"Certainly: his politeness is even affectionate." "Well, it
ought to be, for it is M. de S&mdash;&mdash;, her husband." "They are a
happy couple, then." "<i>Hors de doute</i>: he meets her at <i>soirées</i>
and balls; is the pink of politeness; puts on her shawl; sees
her safe into her carriage, and&mdash;&mdash;" "Then they drive home
together, as loving as Darby and Joan." "And then he jumps
into his <i>cabriolet</i>, and drives to the lodgings of &mdash;&mdash;.
<i>Bon soir, monsieur</i> &mdash;&mdash;; you are making me fall into the
vulgar crime of scandal."</p>

<p class="indent">Now, much as all this may sound like invention, it is
quite true that I repeat no more to you than was said to me, and no
more than what I believe to be the fact. As respects the latter
couple, I have been elsewhere told that they literally never see
each other except in public, where they constantly meet as the
best friends in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">I was lately in some English society, when Lady G&mdash;&mdash; bet a
pair of gloves with Lord R&mdash;&mdash; that he had not seen Lady
R&mdash;&mdash; for a fortnight. The bet was won by the gentleman, who
proved satisfactorily that he had met his wife at a dinner party
only ten days before.</p>

<p class="indent">After all I have told you, and all that you may have
heard from others, I am nevertheless inclined to believe that the high
society of Paris is quite as exemplary as that of any other large
European town. If we are any better ourselves, is it not more
owing to the absence of temptation, than to any other cause?
Put large garrisons into our towns, fill the streets with idlers
who have nothing to do but to render themselves agreeable, and
with women with whom dress and pleasure are the principal
occupations, and then let us see what Protestantism and liberty
will avail us in this particular. The intelligent French say that
their society is improving in morals. I can believe this assertion,
of which I think there is sufficient proof by comparing the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
with the past, as the latter has been described to us. By the
past, I do not mean the period of the Revolution, when vulgarity
assisted to render vice still more odious&mdash;a happy union,
perhaps, for those who were to follow,&mdash;but the days of the old
<i>régime</i>. Chance has thrown me in the way of three or four old
dowagers of that period, women of high rank, and still in the
first circles, who, amid all their <i>finesse</i> of breeding, and ease
of manner, have had a most desperate <i>rouée</i> air about them. Their
very laugh, at times, has seemed replete with a bold levity that
was as disgusting as it was unfeminine. I have never, in any
other part of the world, seen loose sentiments <i>affichés</i>, with
more effrontery. These women are the complete antipodes of the
quiet, elegant Princesse de &mdash;&mdash;, who was at
Lady &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;'s this evening; though some of them
write <i>Princesses</i> on their cards, too.</p>

<p class="indent">The influence of a court must be great on the morals of
those who live in its purlieus. Conversing with the Duc de &mdash;&mdash;,
a man who has had general currency in the best society of Europe,
on this subject, he said,&mdash;"England has long decried our
manners. Previously to the Revolution, I admit they were bad;
perhaps worse than her own; but I know nothing in our history
so bad as what I have witnessed in England. The King invited
me to dine at Windsor. I found every one in the drawing-room,
but his Majesty and Lady &mdash;&mdash;. She entered but a minute
before him, like a queen. Her reception was that of a
queen; young, unmarried females kissed her hand. Now, all
this might happen in France, even now; but Louis XV, the
most dissolute of our monarchs, went no farther. At Windsor,
I saw the husband, sons, and daughters of the favourite, in the
circle! <i>Le parc des Cerfs</i> was not as bad as this."</p>

<p class="indent">"And yet, M. de &mdash;&mdash;, since we are conversing
frankly, listen to what I witnessed, but the other day, in France. You know
the situation of things at St. Ouen, and the rumours that are so
rife. We had the <i>fête Dieu</i> during my residence there. You,
who are a Catholic, need not be told that your sect believe in the
doctrine of the 'real presence.' There was a <i>reposoir</i> erected
in the garden of the <i>château</i>, and God, in person, was carried,
with religious pomp, to rest in the bowers of the ex-favourite.
It is true, the husband was not present: he was only in the provinces!"</p>

<p class="indent">"The influence of a throne makes sad parasites and hypocrites,"
said M. de &mdash;&mdash;, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">"And the influence of the people, too, though in a different
way. A courtier is merely a well-dressed demagogue."</p>

<p class="indent">"It follows, then, that man is just a poor devil."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">But I am gossiping away with you, when my
Asmodean career is ended; and it is time I went to bed. Good night!

<p class="f120"><b>No. I.</b></p>

<p class="indent">The author of the exploits of <i>Brown Bess</i> and of <i>The
Admirable Crichton</i> has announced his intention of <i>editing</i> "<i>The
Lions of London</i>," a task of no ordinary description; and <i>Boz</i>
has already chronicled the slang, humour, peculiarities, and
vices of the omnibus cads and cab-drivers. Pierce Egan, after
uttering a vulgar forgery of <i>Life in London</i>, has in a repentant
fit announced himself as "<i>A Pilgrim of the Thames</i>;" and, in
short, the wonders of this wondrous metropolis are drawn, depicted,
coloured, printed, narrated, represented, in every possible
shape and way to the town and country public. All this
we know: but we know more; we know that there are <i>the</i>
places, <i>the</i> scenes, and <i>the</i> characters to be visited, and
contemplated, and admired in town, which will be omitted to be
noticed by any of our pleasant historians; but which are, of all
others, worthy of sincere regard and periodical immortality! In
the East, according to the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,
the corner of the Kiosk was the distinguished place of
honour; and may we not conduct our readers to corners and
by-places, and "show their eyes and grieve their hearts?" We
have for some time felt a great anxiety to exhibit to our readers
a few remarkable features of society, or rather to introduce them
to Those who are connected with those features. All know, and
yet all do not intimately and in particular know, many of our
great scientific humanists, as connected with particular departments
of our precious faces or heads; but we long, we thirst, to
be the chroniclers of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Mr. A. and the eye,</span>
<span class="i10">Mr. B. and the ear,</span>
<span class="i10">Mr. C. and the nose,</span>
<span class="i10">Mr. D. and the teeth,</span>
<span class="i12">&amp;c.&emsp;&amp;c.&emsp;&amp;c.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Some of our readers will think we are about to publish
the works of <i>Head</i> in the usual popular monthly series; but we see
no reason why old Burton should have it all to himself, and why
a pleasant anatomy (which must be an anatomy of pleasure)
should not compete with the Anatomy of Melancholy!</p>

<p class="indent">We shall at once begin our agreeable task, and as it
is <i>biting</i> weather, we will immediately come to Mr. D. and the teeth,
than whom a more amiable, honourable, or generous man, or a more
decisive and perfect artist, does not exist. Persons may think
that his abode is a mere place where drops of laudanum are
dropped into wretched receptacles of pain; or where bits of
yellow double ivory are lugged out, as though the teeth were
dancing the hays in Hayes Court. No such thing! The house
is a palace! The man is a magician over the unruly spirit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
teeth! The arrangements are pleasant, touching, and delightful;
and the operations are rare and fascinating surprises, which no
person with a discoloured concave, or suspicious fang, ought to
neglect! What a mansion! What an artist! What a deathless D.!</p>

<p class="indent">I do not know when I have experienced more of ease
and pleasure than I did in the capacious and comfortable ante-room;
for I had, to speak the truth, accompanied a friend
who had the tooth-ache, and I saw around me, various respectable
objects of pang and pity, who were about to have that
salutary relief given to them, which the new poor-law has
directed to other poor devils, and which is derived from their
<i>being taken into the house</i>! One by one was beckoned out
by the porter to the relieving officer, and nothing could be
more interesting or effective than the departure of patient after
patient, "with a muffled drum" for a head, and who, as soon as
the door closed, was "heard no more of!" What luxury marks
this apartment! The handles of the doors are a complete set
of ivories; and, indeed, the whole interior is one scene of mingled
splendour and comfort. Let our readers, as Brutus says,
"<i>chew</i> upon this!" A large table stands in the room, covered
with every work that the imagination can devise, for the amusement
and satisfaction of the attentive reader. The students,
however, in this room, are not so steady and intent over their
books as are the visitors to the library of the British Museum;
but they snatch a little agreeable reading by fits and starts, and
take up a very tolerable number of volumes and pamphlets, and
put them down in a remarkably short compass of time. The
person to whom the selection of this entertaining library has
been entrusted, has executed his task with discretion, fidelity,
and spirit; and we were pleased to notice, as we jotted down in
our memorandum-book the names of the most attractive of the
works, how much he had endeavoured to collect together, pages
that should tend to soothe, beguile, and cheer the casual visitor
of the place. First we had "<i>Paine's Age of Reason</i>"&mdash;a book
calculated for those in whom pain and reason are so invariably
connected. Then we had "Sass's Drawings of the Human Figure;"
"The Sufferings of the Early Martyrs;" "History of
the Inquisition, with Prints of the Screws and Instruments
of Torture;" "Lardner on the Lever;" "Coulson on Distortions,
&amp;c." "Tracts on Tumours;" "Montgomery's Omnipresence;"
"Five Minutes' Advice on the Care of the Teeth;"
"The Lancet;" and "<i>Elegant Extracts</i>." There is no refreshment
ready in <i>this</i> room, except that which is derived by
the person who comes to have his or her teeth "looked at," contemplating
a near chair-neighbour who is about to part with
one of those useful inmates, which, like all other domestics,
get troublesome as they get older, and finally lose their places
from becoming in themselves perfectly unbearable! The passages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and galleries are magnificent&mdash;rows of pillars of the <i>Tuscan</i>
order are in even sets, and in perfect order and keeping!
On the staircase, which is of marble, stands a superb clock,
which <i>throbs</i> the time very awfully; and the suite of rooms
on the first floor is, as the visitors cannot but admit, of the
most costly order. Refreshments are here constantly spread before
the lingerer, tempting those (who have not had a wink of
sleep for weeks) to eat and enjoy themselves. In this house
one thing is remarkable, and I think it tends to confuse the
mind,&mdash;"the drawing-room" is on the ground-floor! Here
the soothing sorcerer over anguish and horror&mdash;receives his
visitors; and here, indeed, he sees company in due state. I
merely took a glimpse at this room, which was by no means
so provocative of curiosity to me as was the blue chamber to that
of Fatima's.</p>

<p class="indent">A few <i>mems</i> must close this weak and impotent
description:&mdash;a few recollections snatched amidst the fascination
of the whole place! We observed that the mode in which our artist
expelled a troublesome <i>double enemy</i> put an end to the
usual interpretation of Zanga's famous exclamation,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"The flesh <i>will</i> follow where the pincers tear!"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The <i>pincers</i> might be used, but the flesh did <i>not</i>
follow,&mdash;the eye-tooth came out as clean as a smelt. Mr. D. had several
pictures in <i>enamel</i>, which were much to be valued; and
he had in his hall a portrait by the late Sir Thomas Lawrence of
Mr. Cartwright&mdash;and likenesses by <i>H. B.</i> in one of his closets,
of Howard, Imrie, Sanford, Clarke, Jones, Parkinson, Hayes,
Biggs, Rogers, &amp;c. &amp;c. which are allowed to be, by all observers,
admirable works of art. There is a slight attempt at
<i>Mallan</i> in <i>mineral succedaneum</i>, which appears to be falling
away&mdash;we will not say decaying.</p>

<p class="indent">One nuisance there is, and we cannot as honest historians
pass it over; the street, in which our D. lives, is disturbed,
distracted, by an excess of music, amounting, arising indeed,
into a decided case of "<i>organic</i> disease." The <i>grinders</i>
making a point&mdash;it would seem a pointed point&mdash;of showing themselves
in the very front of that building,&mdash;which is opposed to anything
defective in the front!</p>

<p class="indent">As we were about to depart from this attractive spot&mdash;not
<i>spot</i>&mdash;place,&mdash;we saw Charles Taylor or Tom Cooke slipping
away with every tooth perfect, and yet not without a <i>falsetto</i>.
Some musical wag however still remained, and by permission of
the butler (a <i>drawer</i> of corks in large practice) we were allowed
to hear the following song; and we shall print it at once without
comment, explanation, or excuse,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2>KYAN'S PATENT&mdash;<br />THE NINE MUSES,&mdash;AND THE DRY-ROT.</h2>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That which is most elaborate in nature is that which soonest runs to decay."</span>
<span class="i51"><span class="smcap">Faraday.</span></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The Muses, to their infinite disgrace as useful members
of society, have for centuries been devoting their time to the sun,
the moon, the stars, flowers, lips, hair, love, "kisses, tears,
and smiles;" in short, to objects of mere enjoyment and beauty;
greatly to the delight, it must be confessed, of the young and
the romantic, but tending to no wise and useful purpose, and
contributing to no profitable end. The long luxurious indolence
of these nine inestimable young ladies for so many, many years,
does appear to us to cast no slight shade upon their characters;
and Parnassus itself does not "hold its own" as a place of any
considerable repute, when the habits of its female frequenters
are taken into account. It is, indeed, high time that the Muses
should get into places of all work,&mdash;that they should earn their
bread through habits of honest industry and integrity, and not be
idling about the rose-trees, and wasting their powers on a sigh,
an eyebrow, or a trumpery star. The time for useful exertion
is come; and the days of dalliance, dreaming, and ethereal delight
are passing away. Flora gives way to Cocker, and Apollo is
whipped off the top of his own Grecian mount by the schoolmaster
<i>abroad</i>. If the Muses do not now patronise statistical
reports, poor-law estimates, and fat-cattle meetings, they will as
surely "sink in their repute," ay, as surely as the name of their
firm is "Clio, Tighe, Thalia, Hemans, Euterpe, Landon, Polyhymnia,
Jenkinson, and Co." Imagination is all very well in its
way; but does it know how "things are in the City?" Is it in
the direction&mdash;it certainly ought to be&mdash;of the Great Northern
Railway, or the Public Safety British Patent Axletree Conveyance
Company? Can imagination "set a leg or an arm?"
if not, why imagination may imagine itself carrying out its own
shutters in these enlightened times, and shutting up its own shop
at mid-day.</p>

<p class="indent">We are happy to see, and to be able to say, that the
Muses, like the ladies in "the Invincibles," are marching with the times.
They are setting imagination to work on various well-sounding
schemes for public companies and joint-stockeries. Apollo is
preparing a prospectus for a New British Co-operative Joint
Stock Music Society, into which, of course, nothing foreign will
be allowed to creep, unless it is altered and dressed anew, and
"wears a livery like its fellows." Melpomene is to take the
Queen's Theatre for a serious bazaar, and Thalia is to turn
Astley's into an agreeable chapel for the Jumpers. Urania goes
to the Astronomical Society as housekeeper, and Terpsichore is
to be the lessee of the dancing-rooms in Brewer-street, Golden-square,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
for gymnastic purposes. Indeed, there will not be an
idle body in the lovely firm; and, in future, it is more than probable
that vessels will be propelled by means of airy verse, and
balloons inflated by fancy, or elevated and guided by the application
of high-flown figures. There is no knowing or foretelling
to <i>what</i> extent of usefulness poetry may be carried!</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">It has fallen to our lot to be able to record
one of the scientific turns which poetry has taken. The Muses having of late
years observed that the palm-tree, the laurel, and all their sacred
trees, had, like the trees in all gardens open to the public, suffered
much from ill-usage,&mdash;premature symptoms of dry-rot
having presented themselves,&mdash;the Nine were all at sixes and
sevens about the matter, until they were recommended by a
humane neighbour (as one of Morrison's pill victims says in a
grateful advertisement) to "try Kyan." "Try Kyan!" exclaimed
Calliope. "What, in the name of music, can Kyan be?" On
turning to the columns of the Morning Chronicle, however,
Erato (who could read) discovered the advertisement explanatory
of the great patent antidote to dry-rot in timber; and a deputation
of three of the daughters of Mnemosyne waited on Messrs.
Faraday, Pine, Kyan, Memel, Mills, Oakley, Terry, and
Woodison, gentlemen interested in the progress of this invaluable
discovery,&mdash;and finally at the office in Lime-street-square
the Muses bargained for a steeping of their undying, dying, decaying
timber in the wondrous tank at Red Lion wharf, Poplar.
The process, notwithstanding the mischief done to the wood by
the poets of this scratching age, was most triumphantly successful;
all symptoms of decay, except where certain initials were
carved, at once disappeared, and the immortal plants began to
put on "all their original brightness!" Apollo gave an awful
shriek of delight as he saw the wanton cuttings and witherings
disappear, and the grand leaves of beauty starting into life afresh,
at the inspiring touch of the immortal Kyan. The Muses, with
a few select friends, dined together afterwards, at the Macclesfield
Arms in the New-road, and a song upon Kyan's patent was
<i>impromptued</i> on the occasion, and was very favourably received,
when the mortal waiters were out of the room. We are enabled
to lay a copy of it before our readers; and we are sure they will,
with us, receive with pleasure this proof of the interest which the
Muses are taking in matters of science and useful art. It is reported
that the Nine are about to become members of the Society
for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.

<h2>THE ORIGINAL OF<br />"NOT A DRUM WAS HEARD."</h2>
<h2><span class="smcap">Scrap</span>, No. III.</h2>
<p class="author"><i>Water-grass-hill.</i></p>

<p class="indent">When <i>single-speech</i> Hamilton made in the Irish Commons
that <i>one</i> memorable hit, and persevered ever after in obdurate taciturnity,
folks began very justly to suspect that all was not right; in fact, that
the solitary egg on which he thus sat, plumed in all the glory of
incubation, had been laid by another. The Rev. Mr. Wolfe is <i>supposed</i>
to be the author of a single poem, unparalleled in the English language
for all the qualities of a true lyric, breathing the purest spirit
of the antique, and setting criticism completely at defiance. I say
<i>supposed</i>, for the gentlemen himself never claimed its authorship
during his short and unobtrusive lifetime. He who could write the
"Funeral of Sir John Moore," must have eclipsed all the lyric poets
of this latter age by the fervour and brilliancy of his powers. Do
the other writings of Mr. Wolfe bear any trace of inspiration? None.</p>

<p class="indent">I fear we must look elsewhere for the origin of those beautiful
lines; and I think I can put the public on the right scent. In 1749,
Colonel de Beaumanoir, a native of Britanny, having rained a regiment
in his own neighbourhood, went out with it to India, in that
unfortunate expedition commanded by Lally-Tolendal, the failure of

few faithful followers, and the next day the fleet sailed with the remainder
of the garrison for Europe. In the appendix to the "Memoirs
of <span class="smcap">Lally-Tolendal</span>," by his Son, the following lines occur,
which bear some resemblance to those attributed to Wolfe. Perhaps
Wolf Tone may have communicated them to his relative the clergyman
on his return from France. <i>Fides sit penès lectorem.</i></p>

<h2>A GOSSIP WITH SOME OLD ENGLISH POETS.</h2>

<p class="f110">BY CHARLES OLLIER.</p>

<p class="indent">All hail to the octo-syllabic measure! the most cheerful,
buoyant, and terse of all metres; at once familiar and refined, and fitted
more than any other to the narration of a gay and laughing tale.
Lord Byron, who indulged in it not a little, was pleased nevertheless
to condemn it for what he called its "fatal facility;" but we believe that
is <i>facility</i> is more a matter for the enjoyment of the reader than
for the execution of the writer; since, in the latter respect, it seems
to demand so much of polish, point, and neatness, as to require, in
its very absence of all apparent effort, no little labour in him who
would do its claims full justice. Cowper, who was ambitious to
excel in this pleasant verse, declared that the "easy jingle" of Mat.
Prior was inimitable; but Prior, delightful as his octo-syllabic
poetry undoubtedly is, has many rivals,&mdash;not indeed among his
contemporaries, but in poets who preceded and followed him. Shakespeare,
for example, in whose boundless riches is found almost every
variety of the Muse, has given us abundant specimens of this verse
in the prologues to each act of "Pericles, Prince of Tyre," as spoken
by the Ghost of old Gower, who, having, in his <i>Confessio Amantis</i>,
told the story afterwards dramatised by Shakespeare, is evoked from
his "ashes" to explain to the spectators the progress of the incidents
of the play. The following <i>notturno</i> could hardly have been
as pleasantly conveyed in any other measure:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now sleep yslaked hath the rout;</span>
<span class="i0">No din but snores, the house about,</span>
<span class="i0">Made louder by the o'er-fed breast</span>
<span class="i0">Of this most pompous marriage feast.</span>
<span class="i0">The cat, with eyne of burning coal,</span>
<span class="i0">Now couches 'fore the mouse's hole;</span>
<span class="i0">And crickets sing at th' oven's mouth,</span>
<span class="i0">As the blither for their drouth.</span>
<span class="i0">Hymen hath brought the bride to bed."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Ben Johnson, too, has revelled in this metre: its sweet
cheerfulness appears, for the time, to have drawn from his mind its austere
and sarcastic qualities, and to have lulled the violence of his wit.
Old Ben is, in short, never seen in so happy and amiable a light as
when he writes in the octo-syllabic. Here in a specimen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some act of Love bound to rehearse,</span>
<span class="i0">I thought to bind him in my verse;</span>
<span class="i0">Which, when he felt, 'Away!' quoth he,</span>
<span class="i0">'Can poets hope to fetter me?</span>
<span class="i0">It is enough they once did get</span>
<span class="i0">Mars and my mother in their net;</span>
<span class="i0">I wear not these my wings in vain.</span>
<span class="i0">With which he fled me; and again</span>
<span class="i0">Into my rhymes could ne'er be got</span>
<span class="i0">By any art. Then wonder not</span>
<span class="i0">That, since, my numbers are so cold,</span>
<span class="i0">when Love is fled, and I grow old."</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">But what shall we say of Herrick, the English Anacreon,
who fondled this measure with such graceful dalliance? We cannot
resist the temptation of making an extract, and of <i>italicising</i> a
line or two, that we may enjoy them with the reader:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A sweet disorder in the dresse</span>
<span class="i0">Kindles in cloathes a wantonnesse;</span>
<span class="i0">A lawne about the shoulders thrown</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Into a fine distraction</i>;</span>
<span class="i0">An erring lace, which here and there</span>
<span class="i0">Enthralls the crimson stomacher;</span>
<span class="i0">A cuffe neglectfull, and thereby</span>
<span class="i0">Ribbands to flow confusedly;</span>
<span class="i0"><i>A winning wave, deserving note,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In the tempestuous petticote</i>;</span>
<span class="i0">A carelesse shooe-string, in whose tye</span>
<span class="i0"><i>I see a wild civility</i>;</span>
<span class="i0">Doe more bewitch me, than when art</span>
<span class="i0">Is too precise in every part."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Mark the ease, the play, the <i>curiosa felicitas</i>, of this
exquisite little poem. Could it have been as happy in any other measure?</p>

<p class="indent">The stern and unflinching patriot, Andrew Marvell, evidently
takes delight in the piquant grace of the octo-syllabic. Here is a
passage from his poem addressed to the Lord Fairfax, descriptive
of the grounds about that nobleman's house, in Yorkshire, called
Nun-Appleton. Speaking of the meadows, Marvell says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No scene, that turns with engines strange,</span>
<span class="i0">Does oftener than these meadows change;</span>
<span class="i0">For when the sun the grass hath vex'd,</span>
<span class="i0">The tawny mowers enter next;</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Who seem like Israelites to be,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Walking on foot through a green sea</i>.</span>
<span class="i0">To them the grassy deeps divide,</span>
<span class="i0">And crowd a lane to either side.</span>
<span class="i0">With whistling scythe, and elbow strong,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>These massacre the grass along</i>.</span>
</div></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mower now commands the field;</span>
<span class="i0">In whose new traverse seemeth wrought</span>
<span class="i0">A camp of battle newly fought;</span>
<span class="i0">Where, as the meads with hay, the plain</span>
<span class="i0">Lies quilted o'er with bodies slain:</span>
<span class="i0">The women that with forks it fling,</span>
<span class="i0">Do represent the pillaging.</span>
<span class="i0">And now the careless victors play,</span>
<span class="i0">Dancing the triumphs of the hay.</span>
<span class="i0">When, after this, 'tis piled in cocks,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Like a calm sea it shews the rocks</i>."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The poems of Thomas Randolph, a writer of the seventeenth
century, are not so well known as they deserve to be. A specimen,
therefore, of his treatment of our favourite verse, will be some such
a novelty as is afforded by the revival of an obsolete fashion. He is
addressing his mistress while walking through a grove:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"See Zephyrus through the leaves doth stray,</span>
<span class="i0">And has free liberty to play,</span>
<span class="i0">And braid thy locks. And shall I find</span>
<span class="i0">Less favour than a saucy wind?</span>
<span class="i0">Now let me sit and fix my eyes</span>
<span class="i0">On thee that art my paradise.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art my all: the spring remains</span>
<span class="i0">In the fair violets of thy veins;</span>
<span class="i0">And that it is a summer's day,</span>
<span class="i0">Ripe cherries in thy lips display;</span>
<span class="i0">And when for autumn I would seek,</span>
<span class="i0">'Tis in the apples of thy cheek;</span>
<span class="i0">But that which only moves my smart,</span>
<span class="i0">Is to see winter in thy heart."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Of Butler it is needless to speak; everybody knows Hudibras.
He is, indeed, a glorious champion of the octo-syllabic verse. The
glories, too, of Prior,&mdash;the witty, the humorous, the <i>riant</i>
Prior,&mdash;are too well known to require illustration. We say "too well known,"
for Matthew, alas! had a sovereign contempt for <i>les bienséances</i>, and
only, now-a-days, finds his "way into families" because time and a
classic reputation have, in a manner, sanctified his extravagancies.
But what must have been the irresistible charm of his octo-syllabic
measure, to have seduced the morbid methodist, Cowper, into a warm
eulogy of the very metre in which his licentious freaks were perpetuated?</p>

<p class="indent">As in Prior's case, Gay chose this particular verse to sin
in. We do not allude to his "Fables," but to his "Tales," which are dexterous
and pleasant enough, but wrong. The reader must not expect
specimens. From the next writer, however, to whom we shall
allude, namely, Green, author of "The Spleen," we shall be happy
to transfer to our pages an extract. Green was a member of the
Society of Friends; but, whatever might have been the formality of
the outward man, never did a more genial heart beat in the bosom
of a human creature than in that of Quaker Green. He was a philosopher,
a humanist, a wit, a poet; and we do not like him the less
because he took especial delight in the sly humour of the eight-syllable
rhyme. He found in this measure a pleasant compromise
between a staid cheerfulness and a roystering joke, and he dandled
it to his heart's content in the true spirit of Quaker love-making;
that is to say, with a certain significance of purpose qualified by
sobriety of pretence. The friendly triumph of the flesh over the
spirit was never more cordially manifested; but all is done "with
conscience and tender heart." The poem called "The Spleen"
would have been a luxury from any writer. From Green, in his
drab coat, it has a double relish. The fire that burned under the
broad-brimmed hat of this wise and gentle lover of humanity, was
too strong for the stuff of which his physical man was composed; it</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"O'er informed his tenement of clay;"</span>
</div></div>

<p>and our poetical Quaker died before he had reached his
middle age. His principal poem is distinguished by the elastic play of the
versification, by manly good sense, and flashing wit. Poor Green! it was
especially necessary for him, with his delicate organization, to study
how he might best exorcise the spleen, or, as we should now call it,
hypochondria,&mdash;a task which we, in our Miscellany, have taken under
our especial care. The following extract from the exordium to the
Quaker's poem will afford a good taste of his quality. We have
italicised some lines that appeared to be peculiarly felicitous:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hunting I reckon very good</span>
<span class="i0">To brace the nerves, and stir the blood;</span>
<span class="i0">But after no field-honours itch,</span>
<span class="i0">Atchiev'd by leaping hedge and ditch.</span>
<span class="i0"><i>While Spleen lies soft relax'd in bed,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or o'er coal-fires inclines the head</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">Hygeia's sons with hound and horn,</span>
<span class="i0">And jovial cry, awake the Morn:</span>
<span class="i0">These see her from her dusky plight,</span>
<span class="i0">Smear'd by th' embraces of the Night,</span>
<span class="i0">With roral wash redeem her face,</span>
<span class="i0">And prove herself of Titan's race,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>And, mounting in loose robes the skies,</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Shed light and fragrance as she flies</i>.</span>
<span class="i0">Then horse and hound fierce joy display,</span>
<span class="i0">Exulting at the 'Hark-away!'</span>
<span class="i0">And in pursuit o'er tainted ground</span>
<span class="i0">From lungs robust field-notes resound.</span>
<span class="i0">Then, as St. George the dragon slew,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Spleen pierc'd, trod down, and dying view</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">While all the spirits are on wing,</span>
<span class="i0">And woods, and hills, and valleys ring.</span>
<span class="i2">To cure the mind's wrong bias, Spleen,</span>
<span class="i0">Some recommend the bowling-green;</span>
<span class="i0">Some, hilly walks; all, exercise;</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fling but a stone, the giant dies</i>;</span>
<span class="i0">Laugh, and be well. Monkeys have been</span>
<span class="i0">Extreme good doctors for the Spleen;</span>
<span class="i0">And kitten, if the humour hit,</span>
<span class="i0">Has harlequin'd away the fit."</span>

<h2>AN ITALIAN ANECDOTE.</h2>

<p class="indent"><i>Naples, July 1.</i>&mdash;This was one of the hottest
days of the season. I had long contemplated Fort St. Elmo, high on the crest
of the mountain which overhung Naples, as one of the objects
which I was bound to visit. I knew and felt that, like Vesuvius,
it was one of those sights which exercise a tyranny over every traveller,
not to be evaded, and which he must see, or hazard his
peace of mind for ever; but never yet had I been able to overcome
my natural indolence, and to proceed to explore it. On
this morning I rose with an alacrity and love of enterprise quite
unusual to me, and I at once determined to ascend to St. Elmo
to see the magnificent Certosini Convent, with the Chiesa di S.
Martino, to enjoy the extensive view which this summit presents,
and to hear the ascending buzz of the city and its numerous inhabitants.
I immediately sent to T&mdash;&mdash;, to accompany me;
and, after eating a hearty breakfast, we took our departure.</p>

<p class="indent">Who that has ever mounted the steep, rugged, and never-ending
ascent, will not pity the middle-aged gentleman of indolent
habits, seeing sights for conscience sake, of no mean size, (for
such I am,) as he struggled with the difficulties before him, looking
up in dismay at the castle, inflating and distending his lungs
with an action to which they had long been unaccustomed, until
his face rivalled the sun in glowing crimson?</p>

<p class="indent">At length we reached our object. We saw the sights,&mdash;admired
the beauty of the church, and its beautiful pictures by
Spagnoletto,&mdash;exclaimed with rapture at the view, and heard
the buzz. With my conscience satisfied, and with my critical
observations on all we had seen, ready to be made upon the first
favourable opportunity, I lost no time in descending to whence
we came. By this time it was past meridian. The descent was
very trying upon legs of forty-five years' standing; and the tremulous
motion which it produced upon the muscles, only increased
the longing I felt, to find myself once more extended full
length on my sofa at the Vittoria.</p>

<p class="indent">I had taken off my coat, and, lazzaroni-like, had
thrown it over my shoulder; my neckcloth was thrust into my waistcoat
pocket, and my neck was bare. I carried my hat on my stick,
using it by way of parasol; and, thus accoutred, I determined
to make one desperate effort to brave the heat of the sun, that
was baking the pavement of Santa Lucia, and emitting a glare
that acted like a burning-glass upon my eyeballs. As we walked
through this ordeal, we passed close to an assembly of young
lazzaronis, basking in the sun, near to a stall; there they lay, in
the midst of fish-bones, orange-peels, and decayed melons. We
evidently excited their mirth; and I, in particular, felt myself
privileged to be laughed at,&mdash;for what could be more grotesque
than my appearance? One of the boys was standing. We
had scarcely turned our backs upon them, when I received a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
blow on the head from a melon-rind;&mdash;I turned about, and
immediately the whole gang ran off laughing. I would have
followed; but, in truth, was too tired. I could scarcely move
but at a slow walk. The boys stopped, and looked at us. At
length, making a virtue of necessity, I called out to the boy who
had thrown the melon-rind, to come to me&mdash;he hesitated; I
called again&mdash;he was evidently puzzled, and suspicious of my
intention; I then showed him a carline. "Come here," said I,
"take this." "In the name of goodness!" exclaimed T&mdash;&mdash;,
"what are you about?" "Never mind," said I; "stop and see."
The boy at length took courage, and came to me. "Here," said
I, "<i>bravo! bravissimo! avete fatto bene!</i> take this." Upon which,
in surprise, the boy, taking the piece of money out of my hand,
ran off in the greatest exultation, showing it to his little friends
as a prize fallen down from heaven.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now do tell me," said T&mdash;&mdash;, "what demon of
madness can have possessed you? You ought to have broken every bone in
that young rascal's skin, instead of feeing him for insulting us."
"So I would," said I, "if I could; but to catch him is impossible.
By feeing him for his insolence, he will probably
throw another piece of melon at the first Englishman he sees,
who will, no doubt, give him the beating which I cannot." T&mdash;&mdash;
laughed heartily at the ingenious turn which my indolence had
taken&mdash;administering a beating <i>à ricochet</i>, as he called it; and,
having reached my room, we laughed over our adventure, and
speculated upon the beating the youngster would get.</p>

<p class="indent">And, true enough, the next day, as we were seated
on one of the benches of the Villa Reale, we heard a sort of hue
and cry on the Chiaja, and shortly after, saw our carroty
and irascible friend W&mdash;&mdash; appear, foaming with rage, streaming
from every pore, owing to some recent exertion, and exploding
with bursts of execration. He came straight to us.&mdash;"Who
ever knew such an infernal country as this?" said he,
"D&mdash;them all for a beggarly set of villains. Did you ever
see the like? I gave it him well, however,&mdash;that's some comfort.
The young rascal won't forget me, for some time, I'll
warrant you!" T&mdash;&mdash; and I smiled at each other in anticipation
of the reason, which only made him more furious.
"Here," said he, "was I walking quietly along, when a young
rascal of a lazzaroni thought fit to shy half a water-melon at my
head;&mdash;you may laugh; but it was no laughing matter to me,
nor to him either, for I have half killed the young urchin; and
then, forsooth, I must have half the town of Naples upon me,
backed by all their carrion of old women." We allowed his rage
to expend itself, and said nothing, for fear of being implicated
in his wrath, inasmuch as I was the origin of his disaster; but,
truly, indolence was never so completely justified, as on this
occasion.</p>

<h2>OLIVER TWIST,</h2>
<p class="f110">OR, <b>THE PARISH BOY'S PROGRESS.</b></p>
<p class="f90">BY BOZ.<br />ILLUSTRATED BY GEORGE CRUIKSHANK.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<h3>CHAPTER THE FIRST</h3>
<p class="f90">
  TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN,<br />
AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH.</p>

<p class="indent">Among other public buildings in the town of Mudfog,
it boasts of one which is common to most towns great or small,
to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse there was born on
a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch
as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in
this stage of the business at all events, the item of mortality
whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter. For a long
time after he was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble,
by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt
whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in
which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs
would never have appeared, or, if they had, being comprised
within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen
of biography extant in the literature of any age or country.
Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in
a workhouse is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance
that can possibly befal a human being, I do mean to say
that in this particular instance it was the best thing for Oliver
Twist that could by possibility have occurred. The fact is, that
there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon
himself the office of respiration,&mdash;a troublesome practice, but one
which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence,&mdash;and
for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather
unequally poised between this world and the next, the balance
being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if during this
brief period Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers,
anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom,
he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed
in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old
woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance
of beer, and a parish surgeon who did such matters by
contract, Oliver and nature fought out the point between them.
The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed,
sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse
the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the
parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have
been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed
of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space
of time than three minutes and a quarter.</p>

<p class="indent">As Oliver gave this first testimony of the free and
proper action of his lungs, the patchwork coverlet, which was carelessly
flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young
female was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice
imperfectly articulated the words "Let me see the child, and die."</p>

<p class="indent">The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards
the fire, giving the palms of his hands a warm, and a rub, alternately;
but as the young woman spoke, he rose, and, advancing to the
bed's head, said with more kindness than might have been expected
of him&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you must not talk about dying, yet."</p>

<p class="indent">"Lor bless her dear heart, no!" interposed the nurse,
hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of
which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.
"Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have,
sir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all on 'em dead
except two, and them in the wurkus with me, she'll know better
than to take on in that way, bless her dear heart! Think what
it is to be a mother, there's a dear young lamb, do."</p>

<p class="indent">Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother's
prospects failed in producing its due effect. The patient shook her
head, and stretched out her hand towards the child.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted
her cold white lips passionately on its forehead, passed her hands
over her face, gazed wildly round, shuddered, fell back&mdash;and
died. They chafed her breast, hands, and temples; but the
blood had frozen for ever. They talked of hope and comfort.
They had been strangers too long.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's all over, Mrs. Thingummy," said the surgeon, at last.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, poor dear; so it is!" said the nurse, picking up
the cork of the green bottle which had fallen out on the pillow as
she stooped to take up the child. "Poor dear!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You needn't mind sending up to me, if the child cries,
nurse," said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation.
"It's very likely it <i>will</i> be troublesome. Give it a
little gruel if it is." He put on his hat, and, pausing by the
bedside on his way to the door, added, "She was a good-looking
girl too; where did she come from?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She was brought here last night," replied the old woman,
"by the overseer's order. She was found lying in the street;&mdash;she
had walked some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces;
but where she came from, or where she was going to, nobody
knows."</p>

<p class="indent">The surgeon leant over the body, and raised the left
hand. "The old story," he said, shaking his head: "no wedding-ring,
I see. Ah! good night."</p>

<p class="indent">The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the
nurse, having once more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down
on a low chair before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.</p>

<p class="indent">And what an excellent example of the power of dress
young Oliver Twist was! Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto
formed his only covering, he might have been the child of a
nobleman or a beggar;&mdash;it would have been hard for the haughtiest
stranger to have fixed his station in society. But now he
was enveloped in the old calico robes, that had grown yellow in
the same service; he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his
place at once&mdash;a parish child&mdash;the orphan of a workhouse&mdash;the
humble, half-starved drudge&mdash;to be cuffed and buffeted through
the world, despised by all, and pitied by none.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Oliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was
an orphan, left to the tender mercies of churchwardens and overseers,
perhaps he would have cried the louder.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<h3>CHAPTER THE SECOND</h3>
<p class="f90">TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD.</p>

<p class="indent">For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim
of asystematic course of treachery and deception&mdash;he was brought
up by hand. The hungry and destitute situation of the infant
orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the
parish authorities. The parish authorities inquired with dignity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female
then domiciled in "the house" who was in a situation to impart
to Oliver Twist the consolation and nourishment of which he
stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with humility
that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities magnanimously
and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be
"farmed," or, in other words, that he should be despatched
to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or
thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws rolled
about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much
food, or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence
of an elderly female who received the culprits at and for the
consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.
Sevenpence-halfpenny's worth per week is a good round diet for
s child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny&mdash;quite
enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable.
The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience;
she knew what was good for children, and she had a very accurate
perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated
the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and
consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance
than was originally provided for them; thereby finding
in the lowest depth a deeper still, and proving herself a
very great experimental philosopher.</p>

<p class="indent">Everybody knows the story of another experimental
philosopher, who had a great theory about a horse being able to live
without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he got his
own horse down to a straw a day, and would most unquestionably
have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal
upon nothing at all, if he hadn't died, just four-and-twenty
hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of
air. Unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the female
to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a
similar result usually attended the operation of <i>her</i> system; for
just at the very moment when a child had contrived to exist
upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food,
it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten,
either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire
from neglect, or got smothered by accident; in any one of which
cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another
world, and there gathered to the fathers which it had
never known in this.</p>

<p class="indent">Occasionally, when there was some more than usually
interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in
turning up a bedstead, or inadvertently scalded to death when
there happened to be a washing, (though the latter accident was
very scarce,&mdash;anything approaching to a washing being of rare
occurrence in the farm,) the jury would take it into their heads
to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners would rebelliously
affix their signatures to a remonstrance: but these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
impertinencies were speedily checked by the evidence of the
surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom
had always opened the body, and found nothing inside (which
was very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably
swore whatever the parish wanted, which was very self-devotional.
Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to the
farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were
coming. The children were neat and clean to behold, when <i>they</i>
went; and what more would the people have?</p>

<p class="indent">It cannot be expected that this system of farming would
produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist's
eighth birth-day found him a pale, thin child, somewhat diminutive
in stature, and decidedly small in circumference.
But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit
in Oliver's breast: it had had plenty of room to expand, thanks
to the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance
may be attributed his having any eighth birth-day at
all. Be this as it may, however, it <i>was</i> his eighth birth-day;
and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of
two other young gentlemen, who, after participating with him
in a sound threshing, had been locked up therein, for atrociously
presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the
house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble
the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate.</p>

<p class="indent">"Goodness gracious! is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?"
said Mrs. Mann, thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected
ecstasies of joy. "(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats up
stairs, and wash 'em directly.)&mdash;My heart alive! Mr. Bumble,
how glad I am to see you, sure-ly!"</p>

<p class="indent">Now Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric one; so,
instead of responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred
spirit, he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then
bestowed upon it a kick, which could have emanated from no
leg but a beadle's.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lor, only think," said Mrs. Mann, running out,&mdash;for
the three boys had been removed by this time,&mdash;"only think of
that! That I should have forgotten that the gate was bolted
on the inside, on account of them dear children! Walk in, sir;
walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble; do, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">Although this invitation was accompanied with a
curtsey that might have softened the heart of a churchwarden, it by
no means mollified the beadle.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs.
Mann," inquired Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane,&mdash;"to keep
the parish officers a-waiting at your garden-gate, when they
come here upon porochial business connected with the porochial
orphans? Are you aware, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may
say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"I'm sure, Mr. Bumble, that I was only a-telling one
or two of the dear children as is so fond of you, that it was you
a-coming," replied Mrs. Mann with great humility.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and
his importance. He had displayed the one, and vindicated the
other. He relaxed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, well, Mrs. Mann," he replied in a calmer tone;
"it may be as you say; it may be. Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann;
for I come on business, and have got something to say."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour
with a brick floor, placed a seat for him, and officiously deposited
his cocked hat and cane on the table before him. Mr. Bumble
wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had
engendered, glanced complacently at the cocked hat, and smiled.
Yes, he smiled: beadles are but men, and Mr. Bumble smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now don't you be offended at what I'm a-going to say,"
observed Mrs. Mann with captivating sweetness. "You've had
a long walk, you know, or I wouldn't mention it. Now will you
take a little drop of something, Mr. Bumble?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not a drop&mdash;not a drop," said Mr. Bumble, waving his
right hand in a dignified, but still placid manner.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think you will," said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed
the tone of the refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it.
"Just a <i>leetle</i> drop, with a little cold water, and a lump of
sugar."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Bumble coughed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, just a little drop," said Mrs. Mann persuasively.</p>

<p class="indent">"What is it?" inquired the beadle.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why it's what I'm obliged to keep a little of in the
house, to put in the blessed infants' Daffy when they ain't well, Mr.
Bumble," replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard,
and took down a bottle and glass. "It's gin."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?" inquired
Bumble, following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, bless 'em, that I do, dear as it is," replied the
nurse. "I couldn't see 'em suffer before my very eyes, you know, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"No," said Mr. Bumble approvingly; "no, you could not.
You are a humane woman, Mrs. Mann."&mdash;(Here she set down the
glass.)&mdash;"I shall take an early opportunity of mentioning it to
the board, Mrs. Mann."&mdash;(He drew it towards him.)&mdash;"You feel
as a mother, Mrs. Mann."&mdash;(He stirred the gin and water.)&mdash;"I&mdash;I
drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann;"&mdash;and he
swallowed half of it.</p>

<p class="indent">"And now about business," said the beadle, taking
out a leathern pocket-book. "The child that was half-baptised,
Oliver Twist, is eight years old to-day."</p>

<p class="indent">"Bless him!" interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her
left eye with the corner of her apron.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"And notwithstanding an offered reward of ten pound,
which was afterwards increased to twenty pound,&mdash;notwithstanding
the most superlative, and, I may say, supernat'ral exertions on
the part of this parish," said Bumble, "we have never been able
to discover who is his father, or what is his mother's settlement,
name, or condition."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but
added, after a moment's reflection, "How comes he to have any name
at all, then?"</p>

<p class="indent">The beadle drew himself up with great pride, and
said, "I inwented it."</p>

<p class="indent">"You, Mr. Bumble!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I, Mrs. Mann. We name our foundlin's in alphabetical
order. The last was a S,&mdash;Swubble: I named him. This was
a T,&mdash;Twist: I named <i>him</i>. The next one as comes will be
Unwin, and the next Vilkins. I have got names ready made to
the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it again, when
we come to Z."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, you're quite a literary character, sir!" said Mrs. Mann.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, well," said the beadle, evidently gratified
with the compliment; "perhaps I may be; perhaps I may be, Mrs.
Mann." He finished the gin and water, and added, "Oliver
being now too old to remain here, the Board have determined to
have him back into the house; and I have come out myself to
take him there,&mdash;so let me see him at once."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll fetch him directly," said Mrs. Mann, leaving
the room for that purpose. And Oliver having by this time had as much
of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands removed
as could be scrubbed off in one washing, was led into
the room by his benevolent protectress.</p>

<p class="indent">"Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver," said Mrs. Mann.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on
the chair and the cocked hat on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you go along with me, Oliver?" said Mr. Bumble in
a majestic voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver was about to say that he would go along with
anybody with great readiness, when, glancing upwards, he caught sight
of Mrs. Mann, who had got behind the beadle's chair, and was
shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance. He took
the hint at once, for the fist had been too often impressed upon
his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection.</p>

<p class="indent">"Will <i>she</i> go with me?" inquired poor Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, she can't," replied Mr. Bumble; "but she'll come
and see you, sometimes."</p>

<p class="indent">This was no very great consolation to the child; but,
young as he was, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great
regret at going away. It was no very difficult matter for the
boy to call the tears into his eyes. Hunger and recent ill-usage
are great assistants if you want to cry; and Oliver cried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
very naturally indeed. Mrs. Mann gave him a thousand embraces,
and, what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece of
bread and butter, lest he should seem too hungry when he got
to the workhouse. With the slice of bread in his hand, and the
little brown-cloth parish cap upon his head, Oliver was then
led away by Mr. Bumble from the wretched home where one
kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant
years. And yet he burst into an agony of childish grief as the
cottage-gate closed after him. Wretched as were the little companions
in misery he was leaving behind, they were the only
friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in the
great wide world sank into the child's heart for the first time.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; and little Oliver,
firmly grasping his gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring
at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were "nearly
there," to which interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief
and snappish replies; for the temporary blandness which gin
and water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated,
and he was once again a beadle.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse
a quarter of an hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition
of a second slice of bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed
him over to the care of an old woman, returned, and, telling
him it was a board night, informed him that the board had said
he was to appear before it forthwith.</p>

<p class="indent">Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live
board was, Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was
not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry. He had no
time to think about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave
him a tap on the head with his cane to wake him up, and another
on the back to make him lively, and, bidding him follow,
conducted him into a large whitewashed room, where eight or
ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table, at the top of which,
seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest, was a particularly
fat gentleman with a very round, red face.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bow to the board," said Bumble. Oliver brushed
away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes, and seeing
no board but the table, fortunately bowed to that.</p>

<p class="indent">"What's your name, boy?" said the gentleman in the high chair.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many
gentlemen, which made him tremble; and the beadle gave him another
tap behind, which made him cry; and these two causes made him
answer in a very low and hesitating voice; whereupon a gentleman
in a white waistcoat said he was a fool, which was a capital
way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite at his ease.</p>

<p class="indent">"Boy," said the gentleman in the high chair; "listen
to me. You know you're an orphan, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What's that, sir?" inquired poor Oliver.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"The boy <i>is</i> a fool&mdash;I thought he was," said
the gentleman in the white waistcoat, in a very decided tone. If one member
of a class be blessed with an intuitive perception of others of the
same race, the gentleman in the white waistcoat was unquestionably
well qualified to pronounce an opinion on the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush!" said the gentleman who had spoken first. "You
know you've got no father or mother, and that you are brought
up by the parish, don't you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir," replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">"What are you crying for?" inquired the gentleman
in the white waistcoat; and to be sure it was very extraordinary.
What <i>could</i> he be crying for?</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope you say your prayers every night," said another
gentleman in a gruff voice, "and pray for the people who feed
you, and take care of you, like a Christian."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir," stammered the boy. The gentleman who spoke
last was unconsciously right. It would have been <i>very</i> like a
Christian, and a marvellously good Christian, too, if Oliver had
prayed for the people who fed and took care of <i>him</i>. But he
hadn't, because nobody had taught him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, you have come here to be educated, and taught a
useful trade," said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair.</p>

<p class="indent">"So you'll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six
o'clock," added the surly one in the white waistcoat.</p>

<p class="indent">For the combination of both these blessings in the one
simple process of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction
of the beadle, and was then hurried away to a large ward, where,
on a rough hard bed, he sobbed himself to sleep. What a noble
illustration of the tender laws of this favoured country! they
let the paupers go to sleep!</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Oliver! He little thought, as he lay sleeping
in happy unconsciousness of all around him, that the board had
that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the
most material influence over all his future fortunes. But they
had. And this was it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">The members of this board were very sage, deep,
philosophical men; and when they came to turn their attention to the
workhouse, they found out at once, what ordinary folks would
never have discovered;&mdash;the poor people liked it! It was a regular
place of public entertainment for the poorer classes,&mdash;a
tavern where there was nothing to pay,&mdash;a public breakfast,
dinner, tea, and supper, all the year round,&mdash;a brick and mortar
elysium where it was all play and no work. "Oho!" said the
board, looking very knowing; "we are the fellows to set this
to rights; we'll stop it all in no time." So they established
the rule, that all poor people should have the alternative (for they
would compel nobody, not they,) of being starved by a gradual
process in the house, or by a quick one out of it. With this view,
they contracted with the water-works to lay on an unlimited
supply of water, and with a corn-factor to supply periodically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
small quantities of oatmeal; and issued three meals of thin gruel
a-day, with an onion twice a week, and half a roll on Sundays.
They made a great many other wise and humane regulations
having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary to repeat:
kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in consequence
of the great expense of a suit in Doctors' Commons; and,
instead of compelling a man to support his family as they had
theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him
a bachelor! There is no telling how many applicants for relief
under these last two heads would not have started up in all
classes of society, if it had not been coupled with the workhouse.
But they were long-headed men, and they had provided for
this difficulty. The relief was inseparable from the workhouse
and the gruel; and that frightened people.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first three months after Oliver Twist was
removed, the system was in full operation. It was rather expensive at
first, in consequence of the increase in the undertaker's bill, and
the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers, which
fluttered loosely on their wasted, shrunken forms, after a week
or two's gruel. But the number of workhouse inmates got
thin, as well as the paupers; and the board were in ecstasies.</p>

<p class="indent">The room in which the boys were fed, was a large,
stone hall, with a copper at one end, out of which the master, dressed
in an apron for the purpose, and assisted by one or two
women, ladled the gruel at meal-times; of which composition
each boy had one porringer, and no more,&mdash;except on festive
occasions, and then he had two ounces and a quarter of bread
besides. The bowls never wanted washing&mdash;the boys polished
them with their spoons, till they shone again; and when they
had performed this operation (which never took very long, the
spoons being nearly as large as the bowls), they would sit
staring at the copper with such eager eyes as if they could devour
the very bricks of which it was composed; employing
themselves meanwhile in sucking their fingers most assiduously,
with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel
that might have been cast thereon. Boys have generally excellent
appetites: Oliver Twist and his companions suffered
the tortures of slow starvation for three months; at last they
got so voracious and wild with hunger, that one boy, who was
tall for his age, and hadn't been used to that sort of thing,
(for his father had kept a small cook's shop,) hinted darkly to
his companions, that unless he had another basin of gruel <i>per
diem</i>, he was afraid he should some night eat the boy who slept
next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age.
He had a wild, hungry eye, and they implicitly believed him.
A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the master
after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to Oliver Twist.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The evening arrived: the boys took their places; the
master in his cook's uniform stationed himself at the copper; his pauper
assistants ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served
out, and a long grace was said over the short commons. The
gruel disappeared, and the boys whispered each other and
winked at Oliver, while his next neighbours nudged him. Child
as he was, he was desperate with hunger and reckless with misery.
He rose from the table, and advancing, basin and spoon in
hand, to the master, said, somewhat alarmed at his own temerity&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Please, sir, I want some more."</p>

<p class="indent">The master was a fat, healthy man, but he turned very
pale. He gazed in stupified astonishment on the small rebel for some
seconds, and then clung for support to the copper. The assistants
were paralyzed with wonder, and the boys with fear.</p>

<p class="indent">"What!" said the master at length, in a faint voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please, sir," replied Oliver, "I want some more."</p>

<p class="indent">The master aimed a blow at Oliver's head with the ladle,
pinioned him in his arms, shrieked aloud for the beadle.</p>

<p class="indent">The board were sitting in solemn conclave when Mr. Bumble
rushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing the
gentleman in the high chair, said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir;&mdash;Oliver
Twist has asked for more." There was a general start. Horror was
depicted on every countenance.</p>

<p class="indent">"For <i>more</i>!" said Mr. Limbkins. "Compose
yourself, Bumble, and answer me distinctly. Do I understand that he
asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the
dietary?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He did, sir," replied Bumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"That boy will be hung," said the gentleman in
the white waistcoat; "I know that boy will be hung."</p>

<p class="indent">Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman's opinion.
An animated discussion took place. Oliver was ordered into instant
confinement; and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside
of the gate, offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who
would take Oliver Twist off the hands of the perish: in other
words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man
or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade, business, or
calling.</p>

<p class="indent">"I never was more convinced of anything in my life,"
said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate
and read the bill next morning,&mdash;"I never was more convinced
of anything in my life, than I am that that boy will come to
be hung."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">As I propose to show in the sequel whether the
white-waistcoated gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the
interest of this narrative, (supposing it to possess any at all,) if
I ventured to hint just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist will
be a long or a short piece of biography.

<h2>RICHIE BARTER;</h2>
<p class="f110">THE MAN WHO SHOULD, BUT DID NOT.</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">Yes! the good Sir Toby Plum died; and the very
statues in the Stock Exchange were moved,&mdash;the very pillars of that sanctuary
particularly distinguished themselves by their violent agitation,&mdash;the
old Lady in Threadneedle Street refused to be comforted,&mdash;and the
universal brow of 'Change Alley was clouded with the profoundest grief.
The dumb animals of that region&mdash;the bears and bulls&mdash;prowled about
in savage woe, and "looked unutterable things," on the day that the
remains of Sir Toby Plum were gathered to his fathers. He had a
running personal account of seventy years and upwards with old Dame
Nature, which is now paid;&mdash;(the only one, it was maliciously said, he
ever paid;)&mdash;and he dies possessed&mdash;not he, but others &mdash; of &mdash;&mdash; thousands,
(we leave a blank for the number, to be hereafter filled up,) or,
what is quite as good, the name of them.</p>

<p class="indent">"What's in a name?" Ask that beautiful inconsolable creature,
his widow, who, at the age of twenty-three, finds she is once more mistress
of herself, and of her dear Sir Toby's worldly possessions besides. As
these were supposed to be infinite, can it be imagined that we will
attempt to set down in round numbers what is inconceivable, and,
consequently, without a name? But see:&mdash;there is a staid, solemn,
business-looking personage, just stept out of her boudoir,&mdash;Peter Smyrk,
the man of business, a kind of lurcher to the late Sir Toby. She is at
present too inconsolable to receive him. Perhaps he might inform
you&mdash;you perceive by his impatience and disappointment he is most
anxious to do so. She, poor creature! could not be supposed interested
in such details, who was only a few days ago on the very brink of the
grave&mdash;(for she accompanied the remains of the good Sir Toby to the
churchyard).</p>

<p class="indent">It was about a fortnight after the death of good Sir Toby
that his disconsolate widow felt reconciled to her mourning and "the novelty
of her situation." Absorbed in thoughts about her own sweet person,
and busy with reflections&mdash;such as her mirror gave,&mdash;the important
Peter Smyrk was announced. The sweetest voice in the city welcomed
Peter Smyrk.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very happy to see you, madam; but still
sincerely sorry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Pray, Mr. Smyrk, don't revive a subject so painful to me. Sir
Toby was a good man: I shall never&mdash;ne-ver forget&mdash;&mdash;" And tears
such us angels&mdash;or widows&mdash;weep, coursed down her cheek.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm sure not, madam; and I must entreat you to believe
how sincerely I sympathise with you on your loss, and how very sorry I am
to be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! you are very&mdash;very good, Mr. Smyrk&mdash;very
considerate; so was the good Sir Toby. But these papers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"&mdash;Will, I fear, madam, but create fresh sorrow.
In fact&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Very true, Mr. Smyrk; anything that reminds me of that good
old man causes my sorrows to flow afresh."</p>

<p class="indent">"In truth, madam," said the sympathising man of business, "there
<i>is</i> something in these papers to cause just and deserving regret,&mdash;but
still very little to remind you of him;&mdash;he has left you but 500<i>l.</i>
All the rest of his property goes to his nephew."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"What! all?" exclaimed the relict of Sir Toby Plum.</p>

<p class="indent">"All, madam;&mdash;everything."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I am the&mdash;&mdash;" But the pillows of her ottoman
only knew, as she buried her face in them, the superlative degree of misery to
which she said she was consigned by the too prudent Sir Toby.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a sweet, voluptuous moonlight night,&mdash;so fair,
so sweet, so full of that delicious languor that best accords with the human
heart in its softest hours, tinging the picturesque summits of chimney-tops
as well as towers, and bringing out into pleasing relief each particular
brick of the classic region of the Minories,&mdash;that Richie Barter, enveloped
in a double-milled dreadnought, stood before what <i>was</i> the mansion
of the late Sir Toby Plum. Richie was the very personification
of a man on 'Change,&mdash;busy, important, and imposing. He was head
clerk in the house, and having served the good Sir Toby till he could
serve him no longer, and having wound up the affairs of the firm, which
seem disposed of, in that neatly-tied parcel under his arm, he avoids
the garish eye of day, and calls by moonlight to transact a little business
and condolence together. Richie was a prudent man, frugal both
of his purse and person, and stood at the door of Sir Toby, elevated
with the integrity of his purpose, and the consciousness of four thousand
good pounds his own making. A few moments, and he
was ushered into the prettiest of all parlours, where, reposing on
the most seductive of ottomans, reclined the pale and disconsolate
mistress of the mansion. By the softened lustre of a solitary lamp, the
prudent eye of Richie took a hasty glance around him: everything
bespoke comfort and elegance. He sat down, drew his chair near the
sofa, and laid the neatly-tied parcel at her feet. Only one of these was
visible, and was shrouded from the too curious gaze of Richie in a
little slipper; the other, with retiring delicacy, was withdrawn within
those precincts where the imagination of Richie did not follow. The
communings of Richie on the occasion were worthy of him, and as he
feasted his eyes on its fair and delicate proportions, he calculated
(for he was a man of calculation) by a rule of <i>proportions</i>, that if
one sweet foot gave such pleasure, what would two give? In
truth, Richie, after trying the question by every rule of proportion
that <i>Cocker</i> or <i>Cupid</i> could suggest, boldly asked himself
what might the lady give, who abounded in proportion; and, as a prudent
man, he thought at no remote period he might put that question.</p>

<p class="indent">"Still inconsolable, madam?" said Richie Barter after a
few prefatory hems. "Surely you might yield to the soothing anxieties of
your friends, and be reconciled to the loss&mdash;good man that he was!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! Mr. Barter, such a loss!&mdash;so undeserved!&mdash;so
unexpected!&mdash;and to be left thus a prey to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"We must all go in our turn, madam," interrupted the
sententious Richie; "and 'tis a consolation to his successors to know that his
affairs were in a most flourishing condition;&mdash;a net capital, madam, of
forty thousand pounds, after all demands. You will find the exact
state of his affairs in these papers."</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Plum petulantly kicked the parcel off the sofa.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hate business, Mr. Barter; and were forty times the sum"
(perceiving his ignorance of the testamentary disposition of the property)
"contained in them, I would trust to your skill and integrity to wind up the matter."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"These forty thousand at your command, madam," said Richie,
"the bulk of Sir Toby's property, if properly <i>husbanded</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">The mention of a sum which she knew she <i>had not</i>,
coupled with the name of husband, who she knew had not appreciated her merits,
brought two pearly drops into her eyes, which Richie would have given
a quarter's salary to be permitted to kiss off, and which vied in size and
lustre with those that trembled in her ears; but he did what was quite
as grateful to the widow,&mdash;he summoned a little moisture into his
own. This sympathetic display was not lost on the considerate lady.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Forty times that sum'&mdash;were not these her words?"
thought Richie Barter, as, wending his way down Cheapside, he began to ponder
on the widow's words, "and would entrust it all to Richie Barter!
Well! that sum, and my own four thousand, would make a man of
Richie Barter for life." And, brimful of the gayest and happiest
anticipations, he strode on.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please, sir, what o'clock is it?" asked a little boy of Richie,
as he stood staring at the clock of Bow Church; to which Richie, heedless of
time and space, answered, "Forty thousand;" and, equally regardless
of the shouts of laughter which the answer provoked, he walked on.</p>

<p class="indent">Night after night the precise Richie stood before the mansion
of the late Sir Toby Plum, enwrapt in his dreadnought, and in thoughts
equally fearless. The same low, considerate, but somewhat confidential
rap admitted him; the same sweet little parlour and its fair occupant
received him; the same confidence was expressed in his integrity
and skill. Financial arrangements, discussed by <i>proportions</i>, he
found irresistibly conclusive; till, in the fulness of time,&mdash;according
to Richie's own account, three months <i>after sight</i>,&mdash;he became one
of the happiest of husbands, and forthwith began to make arrangements for
<i>husbanding</i>&mdash;now that he was qualified&mdash;their joint stock; and
Richie Barter was a happy man. Richie was also a cautious man; but how absurd
a thing is caution, particularly in affairs of the heart!&mdash;with which, if
they would prosper, the head must have nothing to do. In a short time
Richie began to discover that he might possibly have been a little too
precipitate in marriage; that pro<i>portions</i>, which gave forty thousand
pounds as a result of the most correct calculation, were not to be relied
upon; in short, that he might have looked before him;&mdash;and Richie
sighed profoundly as he exclaimed, "<i>I should&mdash;but did not!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">The moon that generally succeeds matrimony, and upon which
all the sweets of poetry, and prose, and the grocer's shop, have been expended
to give an adequate idea of its deliciousness,&mdash;thus "gilding
refined gold," and making a planet, supposed to be green cheese, the
very essence of honey,&mdash;that luminary had run its course, and found
Richie Barter one day in the dishabille becoming a Benedict, flung on
a sofa, with his dexter hand thrown across the back of it, lost in a
reverie as profound as his breeches-pocket, with something like a "pale
cast of thought" on a countenance once rubicund, and now rendered
perfectly cadaverous by a glance at a letter which he was crumpling
in his fist.</p>

<p class="indent">"How is this, Julia, dear? there must be some mistake," said
the agitated Richie to the most prudent of wives, as she entered the room.
"Only a paltry five hundred, when I thought forty thousand was in
the way!&mdash;Surely there must be a mistake in this!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"In matters of business, Mr. Barter,&mdash;you know I hate
business,&mdash;there <i>will</i> be mistakes," quoth the lady; "business is my
aversion;" and she swept by the amazed Richie with all the dignity of a Siddons.
"I married you, Mr. Barter, to get rid of business and its degrading
details;" and she looked with no very equivocal air of contempt on
the bulk of Richie as he lay coiled on the sofa, crumpling the letter.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Smyrk," said a servant half opening the door.</p>

<p class="indent">"Wish you ten thousand joys, Mrs. Barter," said Sir Toby's
man of business as he entered. "An excellent character,&mdash;a most prudent
man, is Mr. Barter."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why not make it forty thousand joys, sir?" exclaimed Richie.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very facetious, Mr. Barter; but this just reminds me of a
little business I came about,&mdash;a few debts of your good lady, which her
creditors are a little clamorous for, particularly since you've got the
reputation of having got forty thousand pounds with her."</p>

<p class="indent">"Forty thousand devils!" roared the furious Richie.
"Will the <i>reputation</i> of that sum pay one shilling of her
debts?&mdash;tell me that."</p>

<p class="indent">"Can't exactly say; but, as the friend of the late Sir Toby,
I looked in, in the family way. A little business of my own&mdash;a trifle over
three hundred pounds;&mdash;Mrs. Barter will tell you the value received."
And the prudent Mr. Smyrk presented his bill to that amount, and
left Richie glaring and grinning at this fresh demand.</p>

<p class="indent">"This is beyond all endurance, Mrs. Barter," said Richie,
as he flung the bill on the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. B. deliberately took it up, and appeared for a moment
absorbed in thought. "I have it!&mdash;I have it!" at length she exclaimed,
as the bewildered Richie stood staring at her abstraction.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Mrs. B.; and what have
you&mdash;not forty thousand pounds?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No&mdash;a thought," said she seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">"A fiddle-stick!" cried Richie.</p>

<p class="indent">"No such thing, love!" and the fascinating Mrs. B. slid
her arm round her helpmate's neck, and began to unfold her purpose. "You
know," said she, "how I was disappointed in my just expectations
at the death of Sir Toby. I had every reason to expect that the
bulk of his property, which goes to his nephew, would have been
mine. That young man is as yet unacquainted with the fact, and by
the assistance of Smyrk, whom we might get over, he might remain so,
and for a period sufficiently long for our purpose. Smyrk may manage
that, and also to keep the world in ignorance of the matter. At
present we have the <i>reputation</i> of being the sole owners
of forty thousand pounds."</p>

<p class="indent">"Nonsense, Mrs. B.! What's in a name?" muttered Richie.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll tell you what's in it. There is, in the first place, the
credit derived from the reputation of that sum,&mdash;the splendour, the elegance,
the comfort, the world's good opinion, the world's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Laugh!" exclaimed Barter, with deriding bitterness, as he sneered
at the chimera of his helpmate. "I'm a ruined man! I'm a beggar!&mdash;a fool!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You may be all three together, Mr. Barter, if you choose;
but that would be too extravagant. Let us first settle this trifle of
Smyrk's, whose bare whisper, you know, in the city, will settle the
affair for us; and with your present savings, love,&mdash;isn't it four
thousand pounds?&mdash;and the name of forty thousand pounds&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"What's in a name?" sighed the desponding Richie; but,
brightening at the prospect conjured up before him, he appeared to acquiesce,
and the bill of Peter Smyrk was instantly paid. Mrs. B's drafts
on futurity, and on Richie's four thousand pounds, began to be pretty
considerable; and all the <i>good debts</i>, which, as sleeping
partner in the firm, she brought with her, were paid.</p>

<p class="indent">How often did he revert to his former unambitious and peaceful
life when freed from any attachments either of love or law,&mdash;when,
with a clear conscience, and a well-brushed coat, he sat perched on
the high stool at his desk in &mdash;&mdash; Alley, where his horizon was
bounded by cotton-bags and wool-sacks, and through a vista of tea-chests,
as they were piled in pyramidal precision, before his considerate
eyes! Thoughts of better days and better things came over
him as he flung his last sovereign in payment for some pretty trumpery
of his very dear Mrs. B. and cried, "I might have prevented
all this,&mdash;<i>I should</i>&mdash;<i>but did not</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">In this mood of mind it was, that Richie, as he was one
day exercising his ruminating faculties on the number and colour of the flags
on London Bridge, and profoundly intent on the diagrams formed by
the mud thereon, was roused from his reverie by a smart tap on
the shoulder. Now this was given with such precision, there was no
mistaking it; and if he had any doubts of the intent of the individual
thus accosting him, they were at once dispelled by his <i>captivating</i>
manner, which, though manly, was somewhat <i>apprehensive</i>, and of
such a nature as to be quite <i>taking</i> at first sight;&mdash;such is the
overpowering, irresistible charm of manner!</p>

<p class="indent">"'Tis rather sudden, sir," said Richie, "and the amount
not very great; it might have been settled without arrest."</p>

<p class="indent">"You must admit, Mr. Barter," said the sheriff's officer,
"that the thing is done genteelly; no noise or exposure. Surely you
won't go to jail for this trifle;" and Richie groaned as the
<i>Bench</i> and its bars stared him in the face.</p>

<p class="indent">"No use in fretting, sir," said the chief performer in this
civil action. "There's nothing like bending to a storm. If a man reels
and staggers, the best thing he can do is to 'go to the wall' for support:
and let me tell you, sir, that many a man has made a right
good stand <i>there</i> when driven to it. Lord bless you! the coats of
half my acquaintance are absolutely threadbare from standing too
close to it. You don't understand me, mayhap not; two or three good
<i>compositions</i>, and <i>then</i> a good fat insolvency, friendly assignees,
and a few other friendly etceteras,&mdash;that's what I mean by 'going to
the wall,' Mr. Barter. You'll make a pretty <i>wall</i>flower yourself&mdash;an
excellent creeping plant. You may be bruised a little, and in that
case the <i>wall</i> will be good for shelter and support, and in time you
may creep against it;" and the worthy official gentlemen chuckled, as
he gave poor Barter a nudge in the side, and conducted him through
what he called the way of all flesh,&mdash;a small wicket studded with
spikes, on either side of which stood fellows with looks as sharp and
as full of iron. And as Richie found himself in the midst of the
prison, a sinking of the heart&mdash;a feeling of loneliness and desolation
came over him, and he exclaimed,</p>

<p class="indent">"How easily I might have avoided this!&mdash;I could have done
so&mdash;'tis clear <span class="smcap">I should&mdash;but I did not</span>!"</p>

<p class="indent">The reader perhaps scarcely requires to be reminded, that
an acknowledgment of the independence of America, and preliminaries of
peace between that country and Britain, were signed at Paris, November
30th, 1782; though it was not until the following February
that a vessel from the United States first arrived in the river Thames.
Early in that month the friend who communicated this narrative
chanced to visit an old London physician, who had long since retired
from practice, and who had, oddly enough, selected as the seat of his
repose one of those ancient houses, built half of brick and half of
wood, which stood within the last seven years, on the western side of
the Southwark end of old London Bridge, partly hanging over the roaring
water, and partly standing in the street called Bridge-Foot.
Another visitor, who was then present, was a zealous old Dissenting
clergyman, probably originally of the family of Dunwoodie, or Dinwithie,
but who at this time was called Doctor Downwithit; a name
which he singularly well deserved, from his practice of beating the
cushion in his fervency, in the pulpit, and of vehemently striking the
table in conversation, to enforce his arguments and observations. In
supporting these, he was generally rather loud and tenacious; and
one of his most favourite notions was, that almost all genuine religion
had travelled westward to America, which had thus become the ark
wherein it was preserved, and the very Salem of the modern world.
He believed, however, on the authority of the early historians of the
country, and especially on that of the strange narratives of the
Mather family, that certain parts were grievously vexed by witches
and evil spirits; for, like many of his brethren, he held that compacts
with the infernal powers were still possible. But if <i>New</i> England
were thus troubled, he also considered that <i>Old</i> England was in a
still worse condition; for he maintained the well-known saying to be
no allegory, but a literal fact, that Satan was bodily resident in London!</p>

<p class="indent">The remainder of the party, to which the reader is now introduced,
consisted of the old physician himself, and his wife,&mdash;a little sharp
old dame, most terrifically stiff and ceremonious, and dressed in the
most solemn fashion of half-a-dozen years previous. Her hair, superbly
powdered, was most exactly combed straight upright over a
cushion, the sides being curiously frizzed, and the back turned up in a
broad loop; upon the top of which tower appeared a tremulous little
gauze cap, decorated with ribands, and fastened by long pins with
heads of diamond-paste. The rest of her dress consisted of a stiff
rose-colour silk gown, of great length in the waist, and bordered in
every part with rich full trimmings; whilst the front, and all around
it, was open, and drawn up in large festoons with knots of riband,
discovering an under garment of purple silk, and a round and
full-flounced white muslin apron. Black silk shoes, with high French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
heels and rich diamond-cut steel buckles, completed her costume.
Next to this stately dress, if there were any thing in which Mistress
Cleopatra Curetoun was most particularly particular, it was
in observing and exacting the most punctilious manners, and in the
exhibition and preservation of her tea-equipage; a very rare, very
small, and very fragile, set of Nan-kin porcelain, which forty years
back, was in the highest estimation and value.</p>

<p class="indent">The recent peace with America, and particularly the arrival
of a ship from the United States, had inspired Dr. Downwithit with even
more than his usual warmth and energy in discoursing of them, especially
when he spake of the unlooked-for happiness and glory of "the
Thirteen Stripes of America at that moment flying in the river!"
He also farther expressed his joyful zeal by frequent and vigorous
blows upon Mrs. Cleopatra's small round tea-table, of the carved
Honduras mahogany then so fashionable, which approached in colour
to ebony itself. At every stroke of his broad and heavy fist, all the
china simultaneously leaped and chattered, and the table declined
and rose again with a creaking jerk, which showed how much it was
internally affected by the worthy preacher's zealous orations; and it
may be doubted if either spring or hinge ever perfectly recovered
them. At each of these convulsions, Mrs. Cleopatra regarded her
visitor with a withering frown, every lineament of which was visible,
from the extremely open character of her head-dress; and she
appeared to be earnestly wishing that the boisterous admirer of
America were safe in irons on board the vessel he declaimed about,
with thrice the thirteen stripes duly laid upon his back.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Thirteen Stripes of America in the river, madam!"
exclaimed the doctor for the twentieth time; and for the twentieth time
he drove his fist upon the table with the aforesaid consequences; "the
Thirteen Stripes of America in the river!&mdash;it's a step towards the
universal peace of the world, and an event not to be paralleled in
our times! But what do we hereupon? Why, I'll tell you: instead
of receiving our American brethren with repentance, kindness, and
honour, we let their ship come up even to the very Custom-house
with as little regard as a herring-buss or the Gravesend tilt-boat!</p>

<p class="indent">"Convince yourself of it by today's <i>London Chronicle</i>.
Only listen. 'February 8th. Mr. Hammet begged to inform the House of a very
recent and extraordinary event; that, at the very time he was speaking,
an American ship was in the river Thames, with the Thirteen
Stripes flying on board!'&mdash;an interjectional bang upon the table.&mdash;'She
offered to enter at the Custom-house, but the officers were at a
loss what to do.' Now, Mr. Physician, what have you to say to this?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, doctor," said Curetoun merrily, "that brother Jonathan
was in vastly great haste to get a week sooner where nobody wanted
him at all; and so we may conclude that he's very glad the war's
over, notwithstanding his swaggering."</p>

<p class="indent">"But, sir, we <i>do</i> want our Transatlantic brother,"
instantly rejoined Downwithit, in a vehement and positive voice; "we want all
those blessings which America has in such abundance,&mdash;her liberty,
her patriotism, her pastoral simplicity, her temperance, her humanity,
her piety, her&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Her witches, and her slaves!" added the physician quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sir," said the minister, innocently, "there has not been
either witch or conjuror in America for these last fifty years, and more.
If I live another day, I will go to the wharf and glad my eyes with
the sight of that most happy vessel wherein the Thirteen Stripes of
America are now floating in the river; nor will I refuse to give the
right hand of fellowship to the meanest mariner or servant on board,
but think myself honoured and happy in his grasp: for methinks
there must be something soul-refreshing in the very voice and touch
of persons coming from so pious a country. <i>Here</i> we speak with the
tongues of worldlings; but <i>there</i> the common converse is framed out
of that used by our ancient godly ancestors, who, for conscience sake,
emigrated to the American deserts and forests. It is 'holy oil
from the lamps of the sanctuary,' as the pious John Clarke calls it;
a sort of blessed tongue, which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You're an awful smart chap, I calkilate," exclaimed a loud
voice in the passage, with a most remarkable kind of twang; "you <i>are</i>
mighty 'cute, but I rather guess now the 'squire is <i>to</i> home, and
that I must see him right slick away at once, and so here I sticks."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sure, he speak to massa," added another voice,
evidently that of a negro, with a thick gobbling sound; "he berry 'ticklar
message for him from berry ole friend." Then, in a lower tone, it
continued, "He give Ivory lilly drop o' rum, Mister Spanker Pokehorn
see him."</p>

<p class="indent">These speeches had followed a loud knocking at the door,
and the servant's vain attempt to explain that Dr. Curetoun was engaged with
visitors. The domestic, however, at length succeeded in tranquillising
the guests, and then entered with a letter for the physician,
of which he almost immediately announced the contents, by saying,
"Well, Dr. Downwithit, you will now have it in your power to
shake hands with a <i>real</i> American from yonder ship, without waiting
till to-morrow, or even going down to the wharf; for I learn by this
letter, that my old acquaintance Backwoodsley, who went to settle in
Kentucky twenty years ago, has sent over his intended son-in-law,
and one of his negroes, to collect his outstanding debts, and dispose
of his property."</p>

<p class="indent">"By your favour, then, sir," said the clergyman, "I beg
that we may presently have them both in."</p>

<p class="indent">The physician's orders to this effect being given, in
a few seconds appeared the American and his negro. The former was a very
tall and strong man, with a sallow and most audacious countenance,
shaded by hog-colour hair, which grew in stiff pendent flakes; he
was dressed in a large loose suit of coarse light-brown duffel, with
a long and wide frock-coat and trousers, and a broad white hat. He
carried a five-feet untrimmed bamboo in one hand, and in the other a
Dutch pipe, which he continued to smoke and swing about, to the
great molestation of Mrs. Cleopatra, who absolutely started with
horror, at the sight of a human being clad in a style so savage, and so
entirely opposite to the fashion of the time. Of the negro it is
enough to say, that he was of the Dutch race, broad and big in person,
very greasy in the face, something like a ship's cook; his mouth was
of an enormous size, and evidently accustomed to both good laughing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and good living; and his dress consisted of coarse dark-grey cloth,
with a tow shirt and trousers, and a dirty striped woollen cap. After
a courteous welcome and introduction, the physician inquired after
the welfare of his acquaintance in Kentucky, to which the American
replied in the same loud nasal tone as before,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, the 'squire's pretty kedge for an ould un, and I
guess that I'm cleverly myself; though, as I've been progressing all day
hither and yon, I arn't in such good kilter as I was when I first got in
the ould country; for I reckon it rained some to-day, and was dreadful
sloshy going, enough to make mankind slump at every step. It was
mighty near four o'clock, too, afore I could see a plate-house to feed
at; and when I made an enquerry for one, folk laughed and said
nout, as if I'd spoke Greek, or was moosical, for you doosn't talk such
dreadful coorious elegant English here in your little place of an
island as we do, I reckon. So I began to rile, I did; and grow tarnation
wolfy: but at last I saw the New York Coffee-house, and in I
turns, and spends the balance of the day there. They charged me
four dollars for feed and drinking, they did; and yet couldn't give me
a beaker of egging, or gin cock-tail, or a grain of sangaree, or any
other fogmatic, or a dish of homminy. And now I should like to
make an enquerry of you; what's your names? and how have you
got along?&mdash;I say, Ivory, you precious nigger!" he continued, suddenly
turning round and aiming a long stroke at him with his rattan,
"What do <i>you</i> do, in the 'squire's keeping-room?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Massa help tell he to come in," returned Ivory, most
adroitly edging and skipping out of the sweep of the bamboo.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir," interposed the physician, coming between them,
"it was at my request he came, and so he is not at all to blame. My
friend here is extremely desirous of hearing from your own lips something
about a country which he esteems so <i>free</i>, so <i>pious</i>, and so
<i>happy</i> as America." This he uttered with a peculiarly arch
expression, and a side-glance at Downwithit; and then continued, "But
first what refreshments shall we offer you, Mr. Pokehorn; I believe
that's your name?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, I arn't nice, by no manner of means," returned the
American; "I can take considerable of anything now, but the nigger will
like a beaker of rum best."</p>

<p class="indent">"Pray, sir," said Mrs. Cleopatra in a very stately manner,
though meant to be very gracious, "what family has Mr. Backwoodsley?
I was but a mere girl when he left Europe, though I <i>can</i> remember
he was a fine tall portly gentleman."</p>

<p class="indent">"Possible! Well, now, ma'am, I should have guessed you'd
been raised a purty middling awful long time afore that, to look at you:
but, as you say, the 'squire's tall enough now, I calkilate, and so is all
his family, for that matter; for Longfellow Backwoodsley, of Kiwigittyquag,
measures six foot three in natur's stockings, and his sister
Boadicea is but an inch and a half shorter. What family has the
'squire, did you say? Why, mighty near a dozen, I calkilate. Let's
see: there's Travelout Backwoodsley, the oldest, he was the squatter
as went to Tennessee; Longfellow, as I told you about, an awful
smart gunner and racoon-catcher he is; Gumbleton, that is considerable
of a lawyer in York State: Hoister, as went to sea; my ould
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
woman as is to be, Boadicea; Increase-and-Multiply, the schoolmaster
in Connecticut; Brandywine, what keeps the Rock of Columbia
hotel at Boston, and a mighty powerful log-tavern it is as you'll
see in a year's march; Leandish, that has the plate-house at Hoboken;
Skinner, what set up the leather and finding store in Kentucky:
I some think that's the tote, but four or five squeakers,
squealers, younkers, whelps, and rubbish, that keeps about the ould
log-house at home as yet. Pray how ould's your wife, 'squire? and
where was she raised?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose," said the physician, taking no notice of this
question, "that Master Backwoodsley is growing rich, and likes his settlement,
by his not coming back to England."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh yaas! he conducts well, and likes his location," was the
reply. "He bought at a good lay first, and then filled it with betterments,
and farming trade, and creturs, and helps, and niggers, at an awful
smart outlay of the dollars, I calkilate; but he has got along considerable
well for all that. For sartain he is the yellow flower of the forest
for prosperity. As for coming back, he used to say, when the war
had a closure he would go to the ould country, and bring away the
plunder he left behind; but about last fall the ague give him a purty
particular smart awful shaking, and put him in an unhandsome fix, so
the journey wouldn't convene. So one day, as I was a-looking over
my snake-fence at Rams-Babylon, almost partly opposite to his clearing,
what doos I see, but the 'squire coming along the road at a jouncing
pace on his Narragansett mar, what is a real smasher at a trotting,
and then he pulled up close to the zig-zag, and I stuck myself atop of
a stake, and we held a talk. Says the 'squire, says he, 'Son-in-law
Spanker P. Pokehorn as is to be'&mdash;my name's Anthony Spanker
Pendleton Pokehorn, but he always shorts it,&mdash;'Son-in-law Spanker
P. Pokehorn, I'll tell you what it is,&mdash;I guess I'm getting ould now,
and more than that, I've a desp'ut ugly ague, what has made me
quite froughy and brash to what I was, so that I should take two good
blows of my fist to bring down a beef-cretur; which doosn't ought to
be, when a man's only sixty. Now, you see, as I can't go to get in
my debits and plunder from the ould country, I'll deed them all to
you for thirty dollars cash, or lumber, or breadstuffs, or farmers'
pro<i>duce</i>, if you admire; and the tote appreciates to mighty near
two hundred, I guess.'"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, sir," said Curetoun, "and on this
account you have come to England?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh yaas!" answered the Columbian; "but at first I declined
off to buy at a better lay; for arter higgling back and forth for a while,
I give the 'squire but twenty dollars in all, and he give me the nigger,
Ivory Whiteface there, besides. Sartain he was awful sharp to make
an ugly bargain; but if he <i>was</i> the steel blade, I guess I was the
unpierceable di'mond; and, for fear he should squiggle, I got all set
down in black and white afore the authority, and a letter to Lawyer
Sharples. Now I calkilate to put up all at auction, and to sell some
notions of my own, what I've brought over in my plunder, to make
more avails.&mdash;How do you allot upon that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, sir," said Dr. Downwithit, "that sensible notions
from America are very much wanted at this time, to show us the excellence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of her equitable laws and liberties, and the purity of her religion.
I say, sir, publish them. There's no doubt of their selling
well and quickly for any bookseller&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"The Lord!" exclaimed Mr. Pokehorn, with a shrill whistle
and a sidelong glance at the minister, and then, turning to Curetoun, he said,
"The ould 'squire's awful wordy; he's a Congress-man or a slang-whanger,
I guess, or else he's mighty moosical, I reckon.&mdash;Bookseller!&mdash;Publish!
&mdash;What doos he mean?&mdash;You tarnation nigger! who told
you to laugh? You calkilate as I harn't got the cowskins here; but
I'll whop you cooriously all as one.&mdash;I'll tell you what it is, friend,
I doosn't know what you means, I doosn't."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, Mr. Pokehorn, that you should print your American notions."</p>

<p class="indent">"Print!&mdash;Oh yaas! I guess now,&mdash;in the notice of
vendue you mean. Why, there's no merchants' trade, no awful package; only a
few small little notions, and such wares, though they arn't got
genoowine into the ould country, I reckon. It's some Indian plunder
as I cleared out when I came away."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it possible, then," exclaimed Downwithit, "that
the highly-favoured inhabitants of America deal in plunder! Restore that
illgotten spoil of the Indians young man, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"What <i>doos</i> he mean?" interrupted Pokehorn, in a
perplexed and angry voice. "Why, doosn't he understand English? Arn't plunder
travelling stuff?&mdash;And what did you think notions was?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sir," said the minister, "in our language the term signifies
thoughts; and I supposed that you had meant intellectual, or moral,
or religious views of America; not the base wares of worldly traffic."</p>

<p class="indent">"Perhaps, Mr. Pokehorn," said the physician, wishing to
relieve both his guests, "you interest yourself more in the politics of your
country. Did you witness any of the late actions? or was your residence
near the seat of war?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sartain!" returned the American. "I guess that we had
purty considerable tough skrimmageing about us. What with the Indians,
and the riglars, and the skinners, and the cow-boys, there warn't no
keeping a beef-cretur in the pen, nor sleeping ten winks at a time.
You'd have thought the devil was let loose."</p>

<p class="indent">"And no doubt he was, as he always is in war," said Downwithit,
"or rather he sent forth his legions to vex your persecuted land; for
his only proper habitation on earth is this sin-devising city of London!"</p>

<p class="indent">"That a berry true, massa," interposed the negro, "for Massa
Backwoodsley often say, 'Ivory, I whop you, sure as a devil in London;'
and he always do it. But folk say, another devil in Ameriky,
for all that. He know story of man what see um and talk to um. He
not b'lieve it at all, dough. Good parson sometime preach about he's
tempatation."</p>

<p class="indent">"That's a fact," added Mr. Pokehorn, "and an awful strange
history it is, if true. If you want to hear the story, the nigger can
fix you; for he's precious tonguey and wordy about them devildoms,
and witches, and wild Indians, when he sits in the mud in the
sunshine, at Rams-Babylon and High-Forks, keeping the helps from
work, or at a maple-log fire in the winter."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Then, my sable friend," said Downwithit, "with the good leave of
all present, we'll have it now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, I'll tell you what it is," answered Pokehorn, "if it
will happify the ould 'squire, the nigger shall have his own head for once in a
while; so fire away, Ivory, and when you're not right I'll set you
wrong myself."</p>

<p class="indent">"Iss, massa," began the negro; "ebbery body like a hear ole
Ivory tell he story about a <span class="smcap">Plunder Creek</span>:</p>

<p class="indent">"In um ole ancient time of York, afore a great war, all a West
Indy keys and a Long Island Straits and Sound war' a berry full of a ugly
cruel pirates;&mdash;s'pose massa often heard of they;&mdash;and um ould folk,
what sure to know, say a devil fuss help 'em get plunder, and then
larn 'em how to hide it safe, in a middle of dark stormy nights, under
bluffs, and up a creeks, all along shore, nighum Bowery Lane.&mdash;S'pose
massa know a Bowery Lane, in um end of York?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sartain the 'squire does know that, you tarnation Guinea-crow,
though he doos keep in the ould country," interposed Mr. Pokehorn;
"but I guess it's enough to make mankind rile to hear a body doubt
it, sin' the Bowery Lane, in the free independent city of York, in York
State, must be knowed by all the tote of the univarsal arth, I reckon!
Well, now I calkilate it was a mighty coorious place for them ugly
pirates, and did convene well, being partly all nigh the straits, awful
rocky, and considerable full of trees hanging over, because there
warn't then no clearing them away; and the say was, that the devil and
them tarnation set of sarpents buried their plunder there, where mankind
mought look for it till the week arter doomsday, and never get
it out again. They say the devil's hands is cruel clitchy when he takes
money to keep; and though a purty considerable banditti of money-diggers
has often been arter it, they couldn't fix it, that's a fact, and
I some think that nobody never will now."</p>

<p class="indent">"Him that try a last," resumed the negro,&mdash;"a half-starve
crazy schoolmaster and almanack-maker, name a Domine Crolius Arend
Keekenkettel, what some call he Peep-in-a-pot,&mdash;he travel about and
live by him wits, wherever him find good cupboard. He ask a ole
governor of York let him conjure away a devil, and get up money for
a state; only he want a pay first to help him dig. But golly! a governor
he mighty smart for white man, and no fool; he say, 'Dere a
shovel and pickaxe, dem all you want now, I guess. You go dig; you
find considerable much treasure of a ugly pirates, you hab a half then,
but no tink a get anyting afore, I calkilate.'"</p>

<p class="indent">"Shut your ugly beak, you croaking blackbird!" interrupted
the American, incensed by Ivory's singular praise of the whites; "and
doosn't be moosical upon your betters; though he was an Englisher,
I reckon that he was a purty middling sight afore a small world of
niggers. Well, the schoolmaster he contrived to make friends with a
fat little Dutcher, which had to name Dyckman Deypester, and was
located on a clearing in the Bloomendael, up the Bowery Lane, on the
road to Yonkers and Tarry Town. The say was, that he had such an
almighty quantity of dollars, that he floored his keeping-room with
them under the bricks; and I rather guess that he did keep 'em awfully
close out of the sight of mankind. I doosn't tell you this for
sartain: but, to be sure, he was considerable of a farmer, he was; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
made as many betterments, and got as many humans and creturs
about his clearing, as brought a whole banditti of suitorers arter his
daughter Dortje; and she was besides a dreadful smart, clever, coorious
lass as you shall see between Cow-neck and Babylon. There
was young Louis Hudson, a springy, ac<i>tive</i> young fellow. He was a
settler; but nobody knowed where he was born, nor himself neither,
like a homeless and markless ram. I guess, though, he was raised to
York State, he was such a flower of mankind. Then there was ould
Morgan Hornigold, from Jamaica: belike he was a leetle of the buccaneer,
for he'd been to sea all his days, and looked some between a
Jarman and a Spaniard, with a cross of the sea bull-dog. He was
purty kedge still; but I some think he wanted to lay up for life where
it warn't knowed what he had been. Then there was the almanack-maker,
and a banditti of suitorers besides, as I said afore. I calkilate
that dollars warn't awful plenty with any of them: but what they
wanted in cash, they made up in fierce love to Doll Deypester; and
stuff, and notions, and palaver to the ould Dutcher. He was a coorious
smart individual, and considerably moosical, and so he let them
think that they'd got his good word by sarving as helps on his clearing,
making his zig-zag grand against breachy cattle, or the likes of
that; but I reckon that he warn't the fish to be caught without the
golden hook: though, if the devil had been the fisherman then, he
would have fixed the Dutcher. I some think that it was nigh spring
that Doll Deypester's birth-day came about, and all the suitorers
were awful earnest with ould Dyckman to fix for one of them; the
woman being most for young Hudson, and the Dutcher for him as had
most plunder, and could best get well along in the world. So says the
mynheer, says he, 'I'll tell you what it is,' says he; 'you're all
mighty smart fellows, you are; but afore I give my gal to any of you,
I must know if you can pay the charges; for I reckon for me to give
the dollars and the wife both is what I call a leetle too purty middling
particklar. I won't have no squatting on my clearing, and no bundling
with my darter, I won't; and so, to save squiggling, whoever of
you can bring me first five hundred hard dollars on her birth-day shall
have Dortje Deypester.'&mdash;That was what ould Dyckman said, only I
rather guess that he didn't talk such coorious elegant English as I
doos, because he was an awful smoker, and a Dutcher besides. Upon the
hearing of this, they mighty soon took themselves slick right away off,
all but young Hudson and the schoolmaster; for one knowed when he
was in good quarters, and t'other loved Dortje too well, I calkilate, to
leave till he couldn't stay no longer.&mdash;I say, Ivory, arn't you going to
tell the 'squire the story, or do you calkilate as I should go the whole
hog for you, you 'tarnal lazy log of ebony?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Him tinkee massa like to hear heself talk best," answered
the negro. "Golly! he tell it awful elegant, sure:&mdash;most as well as ole
Ivory. A day afore a Dortje's birth-day, come on mighty ugly storm,
what a ole folk say tear up ebberyting he meet on a ground, and rocks
on a shore, so that man see considerable much strange tings dere,
what he never know afore or again. A wind crack a biggest trees, and
snap a strongest zig-zags like a twigs, and a rain pour down like a
water-spout. Toward a night a storm he little clear up, and a wind
he blow but in puff and gusts, and a moon show heself, dough in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
mighty cloudy watery sky. Then Louis he leave a house of ole
Deypester, 'cause he not see Dortje give away next morning to Jamaica-man,
and bote of 'em sad enough, he calkilate; but there no
help, and away he go in despair. He not got far from a clearing when
he see a moon shine down mighty ugly narrow gulf, where a road go
to a Hudson River below, and he stop little and look, 'cause he never
remember he to see a place afore. While he stand, he tink he hear
man speak, and then he see him sitting on rock in a moonlight, half
way down a gulf, and another standing by. Hudson then go down
heself on a dark side, till he get opposite, and then he look over and
see a Domine Keekenkettel talking to a mighty 'tickler handsome,
grand, ole colour gentleum&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sartain it was the ould gentleman, sure<i>ly</i>," interrupted
the American, "in the shape of a nigger, which arn't considerably much of a
hiding for the devil, I calkilate."</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't tink he look a bit of a devil," answered Ivory,
somewhat offended. "A tink a devil so handsome as a colour man? Be sure
he no devil, 'cause ebberybody know he all white!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Quit, you lying jackdaw!" replied Pokehorn with great
promptness, and a long stroke at Ivory; "that's only in Guinea, I calkilate,
that he mayn't be mistaken for one of the family. Go on, and don't
be moosical, or I trounce you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," resumed the negro, "Louis soon hear a domine say, 'This
our bargain, then,&mdash;I take your place to watch a pirates' treasure,&mdash;I
guess I soon fix him, and get him all slick away. But afore you and
I deal, p'raps you show where a money is buried.' A stranger then
point between a rocks beside him, and say in he's deep voice, 'Dere!'
And then down by a colour man, Louis he see into a ground, what
seems all full of treasure shining in a moonlight; here awful much gold
and dollars, and dere a gold and silver plate, and a t'other place full
of di'monds and jewels, bright as stars in a night sky. Grach! I
tink he won'er, and b'lieve he rile a little that a almanack-maker so
easy get a five hundred dollars for Dortje Deypester. A domine stare
into a cave as if he's eyes eat up all he look at; but at last he get up
and say, 'I gree, and dere my hand on a bargain; I take care all
instead of you, and much more as you can show me.' So he fill he's
pouches, and then go away to ole Deypester for a horses and bags to
bring away a rest, dough he often turn a head to look back at a treasure.
He hardly gone when a strange colour man call out to Louis in
he's deep voice, 'This a dark night for a sad heart to journey in.'
Louis turn he round directly, and see him close beside, berry tall and
genteel, such a bootiful gentleum! dough he no make out he's face for
a clouds over a moon. He little feared and won'ered at first, but soon
he got up he's pluck and say, 'I guess it dark enough, but how you
know my heart sad?' T' other answer him smart, 'That want no wizard,
when he hear a sighs like yours. But he know little more yet: he
reckon you want a five hundred dollars afore to-morrow, or lose your
sweetheart, which a true shame for ac<i>tive</i> springy lad like you:
a pirates' treasure dere, hab a ten thousand times as much, as he know by
a watching it these twenty years.'&mdash;'In a God's name!' say Louis then,
'who are you,&mdash;and who set you there?'&mdash;'One of a last of a Spanish
buccaneers' say the other; 'that berry Captain Hornigold, what make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
love to Dortje Deypester. He take a ship, and kill all on board but
me and young child, that I slave to; then he bring us bote to a shore,
where he hide all his plunder, and stab us, and tell a ghosts to watch
it. A young child he live, and found on a river bank, and so called
by it name&mdash;Louis Hudson, it yourself!&mdash;but I die, and wan'er about
a treasure-grave till a captain come back, or another take my place,
or a right owner come for his own. All that happen to-night, and I
soon at liberty for ever!&mdash;You hear a money-digger say he look to a
pirates' spoil hereafter, and be sure he never quit a creek again,
dough he never find a gold any more. This treasure here, belong to
a father, who killed in ship; it now all your own; take him, but take
a nothing more;&mdash;use him well, and you be fifty times so rich as
Deypester, and hab a blessing beside.&mdash;Hark! a bell strike twelve!&mdash;my
time most up now, and dere come a captain!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ivory, you 'tarnal tonguey imp!" again interrupted the
American, "doos you mean to keep on all night about that precious wordy black
preaching in the creek? Now I'll show you how to finish it all right
slick away at once, I will.&mdash;You see, then, the captain comes trampoosing
up from the river with a spade and a lanthorn, to dig for the
treasure; and, as soon as he gets in, he cries out, 'Plunder and
prize-money! this is a desp'ut ugly awful dark berth.&mdash;Is there anybody
on watch, I wonder?' Upon which that dreadful big black comes up and
says, 'Yes, I calkilate I'm awake here; and now, as I've kept the
treasures of the bold buccaneers till you've come back, if you admire
we'll go off together.'&mdash;'Bear a smart hand, then, with the
plunder into the boat below, afore the tide falls,' says Hornigold.
'Clouds and midnight! how dark it is, and the gale blows stiffer than
ever!&mdash;Seas and billows! why, the tide's coming up the creek ten
fathom strong!'&mdash;That's all as was ever heard of the captain or the
nigger, I guess; for what between the water as come roaring up, and
the rain as came pouring down, they were carried off to sea with all
their plunder, and nobody never saw or heard of them sarpents
again!"</p>

<p class="indent">"A most astonishing and mysterious providence, truly," said
Downwithit, "and worthy of being recorded with the narratives of Baxter,
Reynolds, Janeway, and Mather.&mdash;But what became of the others?"</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">"Why," said Mr. Pokehorn, "as for Louis, he
turned out to be some awful great man or other, and considerable rich. He
showed ould Deypester a thousand dollars next morning, and married Dortje
afore night. But Keekenkettel went mad outright, because he
couldn't never fix the treasure again, and found that he'd filled his
pouches with shells and stones, as looked mighty like dollars and
doubloons in the moonshine. Folk say he was only dreaming, and
that there never warn't no such treasure for him to find; though
they guessed that young Hudson got his money by the storm having
washed it up out of the ground. But it's a true fact, it is, that the
domine always arter, kept camfoozling about the Pirates' Plunder Creek
as long as he lived, as he bargained to do; and whenever there's a
mighty smart storm in the night, with a blink of moonlight, the say is
that he's to be seen there still."

<h2>AUTHORS AND ACTORS;</h2>
<p class="f90">OR, <b>ENGAGING A COMPANY</b>.</p>
<p class="f90"><i>A Dramatic Sketch.</i></p>
<hr class="r5" />

<p class="indent"><i>Scene&mdash;The Manager's Room. The Manager discovered.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Well! my theatre is built at last,
and I have now only to think about opening it. My walls are so dry
that they cannot throw a damp upon my prospects. My stage is
all ready for starting; and every one, I am happy to say, seems
inclined to take the box-seat. Everything now must go as
smooth as a railroad. I have always heard that a manager
must lead a devil of a life; but I am in hopes I shall be an
exception to the rule, and that management to me will be a
delightful pastime.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl</i> (<i>without</i>).&mdash;But I must see him.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Who the deuce can this be?</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;(<i>Enter a Servant.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Servant.</i>&mdash;If you please, sir, here's a person wants to speak
to you.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;I'm busy about the opening of the theatre; tell
him you can't get near me.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Servant.</i>&mdash;But he says he's an author, sir, and has called
about his piece.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;His piece! why, these authors let me have no
peace at all.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Servant.</i>&mdash;He would come up, sir, though I told him you
wouldn't suffer any one behind the scenes.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;And particularly an author; for he makes people
suffer enough before them.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Servant.</i>&mdash;Here he is, sir; he would force his way up.</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;(<i>Exit Servant. Enter Fitz-Growl.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;My servant says you would force your way up.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;And isn't it natural an author should wish to
do so?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Well; but, sir, it is not usual in theatres for the
manager to see any one.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;Not usual to see any one! It must be a very
poor look-out.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Well, sir, as you are here, may I ask your business?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;Why, being anxious for the success of your
theatre, I sent you three of my pieces to begin with. Now, sir,
I've had no answer.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;My dear sir, we cannot answer
everybody. Theatres never answer in these times. However, your pieces
shall be looked out. You can believe in my assurance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;Certainly; a manager ought to have
assurance enough for anything. But I tell you, sir, if you want to succeed,
you must open with my piece.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;What is the nature of it?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;Nature! The beauty of my piece is,
that there's no nature at all in it; it's beautifully unnatural.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Indeed! I hope there is some spirit in the dialogue?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;Some spirit, sir! there is a ghost in it.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;A ghost, my dear sir! that won't do for my
theatre; my audience would have too much sense for a thing of that kind.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;Then you'll never do any good, sir; but, may
I ask what sort of pieces you intend producing?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Variety and novelty, sir, will be my aim.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;Novelty! then my piece is the very thing. I
sink the whole stage.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Thank you; but I'd rather leave the task of
sinking the stage to others; my aim shall be to raise it.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;My dear sir, you know nothing of effect; if
you could only cover the stage with people, and then let them all
down at once, it would be terrific!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;My dear sir, I don't want to cover my stage with
people, and then let them down; I'd sooner hold my performers up than see them let down.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;That's very fine talking; but you must get the
money, and I can assure you mine are the only pieces to do it.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Indeed, sir; then I'm too generous to my
fellow-managers to think of monopolising the only author whose pieces will draw.</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;(<i>Enter Servant.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Servant.</i>&mdash;A gentleman named Scowl is below.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Oh! the gentleman I was to see respecting an
engagement. Beg him to walk up. &emsp;&emsp;(<i>Exit Servant.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;Ah! he's an old friend of mine. He plays
the devil in all my pieces.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Plays the devil, does he?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;My best friend, sir; he has made the
character I allude to his own.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;It is to be hoped, for his sake, that the
character you allude to will not return the compliment.</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;(<i>Enter Scowl.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;Ah! my dear Scowl, how are you?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Scowl.</i>&mdash;So, so; I swallowed a quantity of the
smoke last night in your new piece.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Did the audience swallow it too?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Scowl.</i>&mdash;Sir?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;I beg your pardon, sir; I believe you
wish to lead the business at my theatre?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;He's the very man for it.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;What is your line, sir?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Scowl.</i>&mdash;Why, I don't mind the heavy business; but I prefer
the demons, or the singing scoundrels.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;But I don't think I shall do that sort of thing.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Scowl.</i>&mdash;More fool you. If you want your theatre to pay,
you must stick to the melodrama: the people are sure to come
if you can only frighten them away.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;Yes, I find it so with my pieces;
they draw the same people over and over again, because they are forced to
come several times before they can venture to sit them out.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;But I sha'n't aim at that.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Scowl.</i>&mdash;More fool you. But if I can be of any
service to you in the combat way,&mdash;I can fight with a sword in each hand,
a dagger in my mouth, and a bayonet in my eye. What do you think of that?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Astonishing!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Scowl.</i>&mdash;My friend Mr. Fitz-Growl has written me
an excellent new part.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;What's that about?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;Oh! nothing particular. I write
down a few horrors, make a list of the murders, and my friend Scowl knows
what to be up to.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Really, gentlemen, I don't see that
we can come to terms.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;Don't see!&mdash;what! you
don't want my pieces?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Scowl.</i>&mdash;Nor my acting?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Neither, gentlemen, I thank you.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;Then I'll go home and write a melodrama,
called the "<i>Doomed Manager</i>," and you shall be the hero.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Thank you.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Scowl.</i>&mdash;And I'll play the part.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;What! you represent me? That's too cruel.
But I must wish you good morning.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Scowl.</i>&mdash;Farewell! remember me!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Fitz-Growl.</i>&mdash;And me too. I say, sir, remember me!</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;(<i>Exeunt Scowl and Fitz-Growl with melodramatic eye-rollings.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Well, I hope all the applications won't be like
this, or I shall never get a company.</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;(<i>Enter a Bill-sticker.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Well, my good fellow, who are you?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Bill-sticker.</i>&mdash;Why, I'm one of your best friends; I'm the
bill-sticker. Nobody sticks up for you like I do.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Well, but what do you want?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Bill-sticker.</i>&mdash;Why, sir, I'm sorry to say that as fast as I
put your bills up, somebody else comes and pulls them down.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;How is that?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Bill-sticker.</i>&mdash;I don't know, sir. It's werry ungentlemanly,
whoever does it. The fact is, sir, your bills meet with as much
opposition as bills in Parliament; and I'm sure I don't know
why, unless it is that they are what we call money-bills.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Perhaps they are too large, and occupy too much
space: you know the printing is very large, the type is bold,
and the capitals are immense.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Bill-sticker.</i>&mdash;That's it, sir. It's the immense
capital; it's such a novelty in theatres that they're all afraid of it. Shall I
pull down their bills, sir?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Certainly not. I will never sanction
those whom I employ in unworthily attempting to hurt the interests of
others. My theatre is for the amusement of all, and the employment
of many; but the injury of none.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Bill-sticker.</i>&mdash;Oh! if that's your motto,
everybody ought to stick up for you; and I'm sure I will for one.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Thank you, friend, for the promise of your influence.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Bill-sticker.</i>&mdash;And it's no mean influence,
either; for, though only one poor fellow, I carry more bills in a day than the
House of Commons carries in a whole session.</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;(<i>Exit Bill-sticker.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Well! management does not seem so smooth,
after all: one meets with vexations now and then, I fear. Oh!
who comes now?</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;(<i>Enter Queershanks.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Your pleasure, sir?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;My name is Queershanks. You have built a
theatre, have you not?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;I have, sir.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;Very good: then you will want a model.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;A model after it is built?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;Certainly: but not a model
of a theatre; a model of a man.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;What for, sir?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;Why, sir, you will want occasionally
to give representations of statues. I am an excellent hand at it.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;But, sir, my theatre is dedicated to Apollo.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;The very thing, sir: I have stood as the model
of the Apollo Belvedere to the cleverest artists.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;They must have been clever artists to make an
Apollo Belvedere with you for their model; but I cannot entertain
your engagement in that shape.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;Not engage me in that shape! My shape is
unexceptionable. Only look at this muscle. Here's muscle
for Hercules, sir! Feel it, sir; will you be so good?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Quite unnecessary, sir. I don't think what you
could do would suit our audience.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;Do you mean to say, sir, I
should do you no good? Look at this muscle, sir. Would not muscle like
that make a tremendous hit? (<i>Striking him.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Sir, I'm quite satisfied.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;Satisfied, sir! so you ought to be:
I've got the nose of Mars, sir.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;My dear sir, what is it to the public if you've
got Mars' nose and Pa's chin.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;I mean the classical Mars,&mdash;not my mother,
you silly fellow. Then I've got the eye of a Cyclop, and the
whiskers of Virginius. As yours is to be a classical theatre,
will you give me a trial?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;What can you do?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;I'm very good in the ancient
statues, only I've made them modern to suit the time. You know the "<i>African
alarmed by thunder</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Yes: a fine subject.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;I've modernised it into the "<i>Black footman
frightened by an omnibus</i>:" this is it. (<i>Music; he does it.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Very good! What else have you? Can you
give me "<i>Ajax defying the lightning</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;I have modernised it into the "<i>Little boy defying
the beadle</i>." (<i>Music; he does it.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Capital! Have you any more?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;One more. You've seen the "<i>Dying Gladiator</i>?"
I think my "<i>Prize-fighter unable to come up to time</i>"
beats it all to nothing. (<i>Music; he does it.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;That's something like sculpture, isn't it?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Yes; but it won't do in my theatre.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;Won't do, sir! what do you mean?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Why, I think the audience I wish to attract will
like something better than dumb show. Good morning!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Queershanks.</i>&mdash;I'm gone, sir; but remember you've
lost me. I tell you, sir, that my statues would have made your season; but
I leave you, sir, with contempt (<i>striking an attitude</i>). Do you
know that, sir? It's the celebrated statue of Napoleon turning
with contempt from the shores of Elba, which, as you know, he
left because he wanted more <i>elbow</i> room. (<i>Exit Queershanks
with an attitude.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Well; each person that applies for
an engagement seems to think he is the man to make my fortune for me, and
gets quite angry that I won't let him have an opportunity of
doing so; but I begin to see I must think for myself.</p>

influence in the theatrical world; he promised to speak to you; has he done so?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Really, madam, I do not remember to
have had an interview with any such person.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. F.</i>&mdash;Indeed! that's strange: but I suppose

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;Indeed, madam; I'm happy
to make their acquaintance.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. F.</i>&mdash;And so you ought to be, sir. Come here,
Julietta: this young lady, sir, has got <i>such</i> a voice! It goes upon the high
<i>C's</i> as safe as an East-Indiaman. I want you to engage her.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;I should like to hear her sing,
before I thought of engaging her; she might fail.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. F.</i>&mdash;And if she did, sir,&mdash;if the public
were so unjust,&mdash;how great would be the consolation to you to know that you
partially repaired the injury by paying the dear child a salary!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;I am afraid, madam,
I could not proceed on that plan.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. F.</i>&mdash;You will excuse my saying, sir,
that you have strange notions of liberality; but you shall hear her sing.
Come, my dear, let's have the <i>Baccy-role</i>; it's beautiful in your

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. F.</i>&mdash;You see, sir, that's what the dear

that will wear off when she gets before the audience.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mrs. F.</i>&mdash;What can he do! anything&mdash;he's

no small difficulty in exercising one's own discretion in these

<h2>A CRITICAL GOSSIP WITH<br />LADY MARY WORTLEY MONTAGU.</h2>

<p class="indent">The character of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu is about as
little known to the generality of readers as the source of the Nile, or the
precise position of the North Pole. She has taken her place in public
estimation as a forward, witty, voluptuous woman of fashion, who
flirted, if she did not intrigue, with Pope; who was initiated into all
the mysteries of a Turkish harem, and who chronicled those mysteries
with no very delicate hand:&mdash;who affected friendships, lampooned
her associates, and wrote verses of <i>single-entendre</i>; who married
rashly, loved unwisely, and led a life of ultra-friendship and long
unexplained divorce. Such is Lady Mary Wortley Montagu supposed
to be! so prone is biography to perpetuate the fleeting scandals of
the day, to distort mystery or obscurity into indecorum or baseness,
and to darken and discolour the stream of time with the filth that is
vulgarly and maliciously thrown into it at its source. The period appears
to have arrived at which Lady Mary's character has obtained
the power of purifying itself. With many faults, constitutional as
well as acquired, there can be no doubt that she was a lady of surpassing
powers of mind, of extreme wit, an easy command of her
own as well as of the learned languages, a surprising knowledge of
the world even in her youth, a vivid poetical imagination, a heart full
of foibles, but fuller of love for her <i>own</i> circle, and that of her
friends; and, above all, an abundance of common sense, which regulated her
affections, her actions, her reflections, and her style, so as to render
her the most accomplished lady of her own, or of the subsequent age.
We do not think we can do justice to this fascinating creature in a
better way than by lounging through the three volumes which Lord
Wharncliffe's ancestral love, literary ability, and elegant taste, have
given to the world. We may gossip with this work as we might with
her who originated it, stroll with her in her favourite gardens, listen
to her verses, catch her agreeable anecdotes, receive her valuable
observations on human nature, as though she were actually before us in
her splendid and <i>eternal</i> nightgown, or in her Turkish dress, (so sweet
in Lord Harrington's charming miniature) or in her domino at Venice,
or in her lute-string, or in her English court-dress. Our gossip,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
however,&mdash;save as to the remarks we may, to use the phrase of the
dramatist, utter aside to that vast pit, the public,&mdash;will very much
resemble that between Macbeth and the armed head, at which the
witches give their admonitory caution. That caution will not be lost
upon us&mdash;for it will nearly be,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"Hear <i>her</i> speak,
and say thou nought."</p>

<p class="indent">The introduction to this interesting work is from the editor,
and it is written with a Walpole felicity in its points, though we would rather
have had it more continuous than anecdotical. Our purpose we
have professed to be, to gossip with Lady Mary, and we therefore
shall make but two extracts from the introduction,&mdash;the one because
it is <i>perhaps</i> leaning to the unfeeling; the other, because it is
indisputably the truth of feeling. Madame de Sevigné did not deserve the
phrase which we have marked in italics in the following passage, and
indeed Lady Mary, in one of her letters, announces herself as a successful
rival of this very agreeable French letter-writer,&mdash;an announcement
which ought to have cautioned an editor against depreciating
the powers of one whom the edited had chosen to select as a rival.</p>

<p class="indent">"The modern world will smile, but should however beware
of too hastily despising works that charmed Lady Mary Wortley in her
youth, and were courageously defended by Madame de Sevigné even
when hers was past, and they began to be sliding out of fashion. She,
it seems, thought with the <i>old woman</i> just now mentioned, that they
had a tendency to elevate the mind, and to instil honourable and generous
sentiments. At any rate they must have fostered application
and perseverance, by accustoming their readers to what the French
term <i>des ouvrages de longue haleine</i>. After resolutely mastering
Clelia, nobody could pretend to quail at the aspect of Mezeray, or even
at that of Holinshed's Chronicle printed in black letter. Clarendon,
Burnet, and Rapin, had not yet issued into daylight."</p>

<p class="indent">With the foregoing extract (and all critics should get
rid of their bile as quickly as they can) all that is unpleasant is at rest.
Let us give the following feeling, beautiful anecdote.</p>

<p class="indent">"The name of another young friend will excite more
attention&mdash;Mrs. Anne Wortley. <i>Mrs.</i> Anne has a most mature sound to our
modern ears; but, in the phraseology of those days, <i>Miss</i>, which had
hardly yet ceased to be a term of reproach, still denoted childishness,
flippancy, or some other contemptible quality, and was rarely applied
to young ladies of a respectable class. In Steele's Guardian, the
youngest of Nestor Ironside's wards, aged fifteen, is Mrs. Mary Lizard.
Nay, Lady Bute herself could remember having been styled Mrs.
Wortley, when a child, by two or three elderly visitors, as tenacious of
their ancient modes of speech as of other old fashions. Mrs. Anne,
then, was the second daughter of Mr. Sidney<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Wortley Montagu, and the favourite sister of his son Edward. She died in
the bloom of youth, unmarried. Lady Mary, in common with others who had
known her, represented her as eminently pretty and agreeable; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
her brother so cherished her memory, that, in after times, his little
girl knew it to be the highest mark of his favour, when, pointing at
herself, he said to her mother, "Don't you think she grows like my
poor sister Anne?"</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Mary had Lord Byron's fate. She wrote a journal
of her life; she became the historian of her own genius, her youthful love,
and her young trials. It chanced to be her fate, that the one into
whose hands her manuscript fell, considered it her duty (wisely and
affectionately, or not, is immaterial for our purposes) to doom it to be
a work of destruction. It is hard for genius that it cannot find an
executor who regards the future in preference to the present; who
cannot absolve himself from immediate ties, living incumbrances,
pressing prejudices, conceived personalities,&mdash;to yield immortality its
due!&mdash;who, in fact, in the blindness of temporary fears and temporary
associations, classes that which he holds, erringly as that of
the age,&mdash;which should be, and in its spirit was destined to be, "for
all time." We have mentioned two immortal names; and before we
pass into the three volumes, we cannot help endeavouring to connect
them in the minds of our readers, as they are by their spirit connected
in ours. Lord Byron was a moody, fiery, brooding child,&mdash;full of passion,
obstinacy, and irregularity, in his teens;&mdash;Lady Mary was a
single-thinking, classical, daring, inspired girl long under one-and-twenty.
Lord Byron at a plunge formed his own spreading circles on
the glittering still-life lake of fashionable society: Lady Mary with
her beauty and her genius effected the same result by the same impetuosity.
Lady Mary made, as it would appear, a cold unsatisfactory
marriage, but, it must be admitted, with one possessed of a patience
untainted by genius:&mdash;Lord Byron iced himself into the connubial state,
but shuddered at its coldness. The press, and the poets, and the
prosers united with serene ferocity against both. Both, alas! were</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">"Souls made of fire and children of the sun,</span>
<span class="i9">With whom revenge was virtue!"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Their revenge was mutual-minded. Misunderstood, calumniated,
they quitted the land which was not worthy of them. Genius-borne, they
both passed to the east; and to them we owe the most sensible,&mdash;the
most passioned,&mdash;the most voluptuous,&mdash;and the most inspired pictures
of "the land of the citron and myrtle," that have ever waked
the wish and melted the heart of us southron readers. A mysterious
divorcement from the marital partner marked the absence&mdash;the long
last absence&mdash;of each! Mind-banished,&mdash;person-expatriated,&mdash;they
vented upon their country that revenge of which injured genius can
alone be capable. And looking at the calumnies upon the one, and
the female animosities towards the other,&mdash;regarding the banishment
of mental beauty and magic power in both,&mdash;we cannot better convey
to our readers the revenge which genius gave, and must ever give,
than by making a common cause of the two, and explaining it in the
inimitable lines of the one.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"And if my voice break forth, 'tis not that now</span>
<span class="i10">I shrink from what is suffered; let him speak</span>

<span class="i10">And pile on human heads the mountain of my curse.</span>
<span class="i10">That curse shall be <i>forgiveness</i>!"&mdash;</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">This is indeed the inspiration of forgiveness. We feel an
awe after reading this humane and lofty imprecation, which calls for a pause.
There is the same feeling upon us from which we cannot escape,
as that to which we are subject when we wander under the arched
roof and sculptured aisles,&mdash;in the breathing, breathless, cathedral
silence,&mdash;in the awful stone repose,&mdash;in the contemplation of</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"The uplifted palms,
the silent marble lips!"</p>

<p class="indent">The similarity between the genius of Byron and that of Lady Mary,
and their fates,&mdash;except as to the death and duration of life of the
two, (the one dying at the age of thirty-seven, and the other at the
age of seventy-three,&mdash;a sad and strange reverse figures!)&mdash;are
singularly interesting and affecting. The one,&mdash;sexually to distinguish
them,&mdash;was <i>Rousseau</i> with a heart,&mdash;the other <i>De Staël</i>
with one.&mdash;But we grow serious, critical, and minute. We are not certain
that we are not growing anatomical. We shall therefore enter upon our
<i>conversazione</i> with our charming, high-born, easy
caftan,&mdash;Minerva,&mdash;Lady Mary Wortley Montagu!</p>

<p class="indent">We pass silently over her biography, and at once commence
with the unmarried <i>Lady Mary Pierrepont</i> and the married Montagu!
What can be livelier than the following York picture. It is
<i>Hogarthian</i>!&mdash;and let it not be forgotten that the lady was
only twenty, and unwedded.</p>

<p class="center"><br />"TO MRS. WORTLEY."</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"I return you a thousand thanks, my dear,
for so agreeable an entertainment as your letter in our cold climate, where the
sun appears unwillingly&mdash;Wit is as wonderfully pleasing as a sun-shiny day;
and, to speak poetically, Ph&oelig;bus is very sparing of all his favours.
I fancied your letter an emblem of yourself: in some parts I found the
softness of your voice, and in others the vivacity of your eyes: you
are to expect no return but humble and hearty thanks, yet I can't
forbear entertaining you with our York lovers. (Strange monsters
you'll think, love being as much forced up here as melons.) In the
first form of these creatures, is even Mr. Vanbrug. Heaven, no doubt,
compassionating our dulness, has inspired him with a passion that
make us all ready to die with laughing: 'tis credibly reported that he
is endeavouring at the honourable state of matrimony, and vows to
lead a sinful life no more. Whether pure holiness inspires the mind,
or dotage turns his brain, is hard to find. 'Tis certain he keeps Monday
and Thursday market (<i>assembly</i> day) constantly; and for those
that don't regard worldly muck, there's extraordinary good choice indeed.
I believe last Monday there were two hundred pieces of woman's
flesh (fat and lean): but you know Van's taste was always
odd: his inclination to ruins has given him a fancy for Mrs. Yarborough:
he sighs and ogles so, that it would do your heart good to see
him; and she is not a little pleased in so small a proportion of men
amongst such a number of women, that a whole man should fall to
her share. My dear, adieu, My service to Mr. Congreve.</p>

<p class="indent">This delightful epistle to Congreve appears to have been written
at the time she resided at Twickenham,&mdash;lured there by the quiet and
loveliness of that classic spot, and the fascination of Pope's society.
The following letter would seem to confirm the sincerity of these
racy verses;&mdash;and the presence of "Doctor Swift and Johnny Gay,"
&mdash;ballad-writing too,&mdash;must have had some influence over the pen
of the poetess.</p>

<p class="center space-above1">"TO THE COUNTESS OF MAR.</p>
<p class="author">"Twickenham, 17&mdash;.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"<span class="smcap">Dear Sister,</span>
&mdash;I was very glad to hear from you, though there
was something in your letters very monstrous and shocking. I wonder
with what conscience you can talk to me of your being an old
woman; I beg I may hear no more on't. For my part I pretend to
be as young as ever, and really am as young as needs to be, to all intents
and purposes. I attribute all this to your living so long at Chatton,
and fancy a week at Paris will correct such wild imaginations,
and set things in a better light. My cure for lowness of spirits is not
drinking nasty water, but galloping all day, <i>and a moderate glass of
champaign at night in good company</i>; and I believe this regimen,
closely followed, is one of the most wholesome that can be prescribed,

as it appears by the text, not willing to own herself middle-aged. Another lady
happened to be sitting at breakfast with her when an awkward country
lad, new in her service, brought word that 'there was one as
begged to speak to her.'&mdash;'What is his name?'&mdash;'Don't know.'&mdash;'What
sort of person? a gentleman?'&mdash;'Can't say rightly.'&mdash;'Go
and ask him his business.'&mdash;The fellow returned grinning. 'Why,
madam, he says as how&mdash;he says he is&mdash;'&mdash;'Well, what does he say,
fool?'&mdash;'He says he is one as dies for your ladyship.'&mdash;'Dies for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
me! exclaimed the lady, the more incensed from seeing her friend
inclined to laugh as well as her footman,&mdash;'was there ever such a
piece of insolence! Turn him out of my house this minute. And
hark ye, shut the door in his face.' The clown obeyed; but going
to work more roughly than John Bull will ever admit of, produced a
scuffle that disturbed the neighbours and called in the constable. At
last the audacious lover, driven to explain himself, proved nothing
worse than an honest tradesman, a dyer, whom her ladyship often employed
to refresh her old gowns."</p>

carried half the pleasures of my life along with her; I am more stupid
than I can describe, and am as full of moral reflections as either Cambray
or Pascal. I think of nothing but the nothingness of the good
things of this world, the transitoriness of its joys, the pungency of its
sorrows, and many discoveries that have been made these three thousand
years, and committed to print ever since the first erecting of
presses. I advise you, as the best thing you can do that day, let it
happen as it will, to visit Lady Stafford: she has the goodness to
carry with her a true-born Englishwoman, who is neither good nor
bad, nor capable of being either; Lady Phil Prat by name, of the
Hamilton family, and who will be glad of your acquaintance, and you
can never be sorry for hers.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>

never was fuller, and, God be praised, some people <i>brille</i> in it who
<i>brilled</i> twenty years ago. My cousin Buller is of that number, who
is just what she was in all respects when she inhabited Bond-street.
The sprouts of this age are such green withered things, 'tis a great
comfort to us grown up people: I except my own daughter, who is to
be the ornament of the ensuing court. I beg you will exact from Lady
Stafford a particular of her perfections, which would sound suspected
from my hand; at the same time I must do justice to a little twig belonging
to my sister Gower. Miss Jenny is like the Duchess of
Queensberry both in face and spirit. <i>A propos</i> of family affairs: I
had almost forgot our dear and amiable cousin Lady Denbigh, who
has blazed out all this winter; she has brought with her from Paris
cart-loads of riband, surprising fashion, and of a complexion of the
last edition, which naturally attracts all the she and he fools in London;
and accordingly she is surrounded with a little court of both,
and keeps a Sunday assembly to shew she has learned to play at cards
on that day. Lady Frances Fielding<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>

royal blood, with all his grandmother's beauty, wit and good qualities.
In short, he is Nell Gwin in person, with the sex altered, and

<p class="blockquot indent">"I cannot deny, but that I was very well diverted
on the Coronation day. I saw the procession much at my ease, in a house which I
filled with my own company, and then got into Westminster-hall
without trouble, where it was very entertaining to observe the variety
of airs that all meant the same thing. The business of every walker
there was to conceal vanity and gain admiration. For these purposes
some languished and others strutted; but a visible satisfaction was
diffused over every countenance, as soon as the coronet was clapped
on the head. But she that drew the greatest number of eyes, was
indisputably Lady Orkney. She exposed behind a mixture of fat and
wrinkles; and before, a very considerable protuberance which preceded
her. Add to this, the inimitable roll of her eyes, and her grey
hairs, which by good fortune stood directly upright, and 'tis impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
to imagine a more delightful spectacle. She had embellished all this
with considerable magnificence, which made her look as big again as
usual; and I should have thought her one of the largest things of
God's making if my Lady St. J**n had not displayed all her charms in
honour of the day. The poor Duchess of M***se <i>crept along with a
dozen of black snakes playing round her face</i>, and my Lady P***nd
(who is fallen away since her dismission from court) represented very
finely an Egyptian mummy embroidered over with hieroglyphics."</p>

<p class="indent space-below2">Lady Mary read, and of course loved, the writings of Fielding.
He was related to her. She had in her service a Fanny at the time she
read Joseph Andrews, and thus she writes of her:</p>

<p class="center">"TO THE COUNTESS OF BUTE.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"<span class="smcap">My dear Child</span>,&mdash;
 have at length received the box, with the
books enclosed, for which I give you many thanks, as they amused me
very much. I gave a very ridiculous proof of it, fitter indeed for my
grand-daughter than myself. I returned from a party on horseback:
and after having rode twenty miles, part of it by moonshine, it was
ten at night when I found the box arrived. I could not deny myself
the pleasure of opening it; and falling upon Fielding's works, was
fool enough to sit up all night reading. I think Joseph Andrews better
than his Foundling. I believe I was the more struck with it, having
at present a Fanny in my own house, not only by the name, which
happens to be the same, but the extraordinary beauty, joined with an
understanding yet more extraordinary at her age, which is but few
months past sixteen: she is in the post of my chambermaid. I fancy
you will tax my discretion for taking a servant thus qualified; but my
woman, who is also my housekeeper, was always teizing me with her
having too much work, and complaining of ill health, which determined
me to take her a deputy; and when I was at Louvere, where I
drank the waters, one of the most considerable merchants there pressed
me to take this daughter of his: her mother has an uncommon
good character, and the girl has had a better education than is usual
for those of her rank; she writes a good hand, and has been brought
up to keep accounts, which she does to great perfection; and had herself
such a violent desire to serve me, that I was persuaded to take
her: I do not yet repent it from any part of her behaviour. But there
has been no peace in the family ever since she came into it; I might
say the parish, all the women in it having declared open war with her,
and the men endeavouring all treaties of a different sort: my own
woman puts herself at the head of the first party, and her spleen is
increased by having no reason for it. The young creature is never
stirring from my apartment, always at her needle, and never
complaining of any thing. You will laugh at this tedious account of my
domestics (if you have patience to read it over), but I have few other
subjects to talk of."</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing can be livelier or happier than the following agreeable
outbreak at Lady J. Wharton lavishing herself away upon one unworthy her.

the hands are strangely given and taken, while they are in motion, at

<p class="indent">The observations on Richardson are a little too harsh,&mdash;
but the sobbing over his works is a compliment which no criticism could dry up.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"This Richardson is a strange fellow. I heartily despise
him, and eagerly read him, nay, sob over his works, in a most scandalous manner.
The two first tomes of Clarissa touched me, as being very resembling
to my maiden days; and I find in the pictures of Sir Thomas
Grandison and his lady, what I have heard of my mother, and
seen of my father."</p>

<p class="indent space-below2">Time having made us wiser than <i>the Wortley</i>,
it is amusing to see her guessing at and confounding authors and their works.</p>

<p class="center">"TO THE COUNTESS OF BUTE.</p>

<p class="author"><br />"Louvere, June 23, 1754.</p>
<p class="blockquot indent">"<span class="smcap">My dear Child</span>,&mdash;I have promised
you some remarks on all the books I have received. I believe you would easily forgive
my not keeping my word; however, I shall go on. The Rambler is certainly
a strong misnomer; he always plods in the beaten road of his predecessors,
following the Spectator (with the same pace a pack-horse
would do a hunter) in the style that is proper to lengthen a paper.
These writers may, perhaps, be of service to the public, which is saying
a great deal in their favour. There are numbers of both sexes
who never read anything but such productions, and cannot spare time,
from doing nothing, to go through a sixpenny pamphlet. Such gentle
readers may be improved by a moral hint, which, though repeated over
and over, from generation to generation, they never heard in their
lives. I should be glad to know the name of this laborious author.
H. Fielding has given a true picture of himself and his first wife, in
the characters of Mr. and Mrs. Booth, some compliments to his own
figure excepted; and, I am persuaded, several of the incidents he
mentions are real matters of fact. I wonder he does not perceive Tom
Jones and Mr. Booth are sorry scoundrels. All this sort of books have
the same fault, which I cannot easily pardon, being very mischievous.
They place a merit in extravagant passions, and encourage young
people to hope for impossible events, to draw them out of the misery
they choose to plunge themselves into, expecting legacies from unknown
relations, and generous benefactors to distressed virtue, as
much out of nature as fairy treasures. Fielding has really a fund of
true humour, and was to be pitied at his first entrance into the world,
having no choice, as he said himself, but to be a hackney writer, or a
hackney coachman. His genius deserved a better fate: but I cannot
help blaming that continued indiscretion, to give it the softest name,
that has run through his life, and I am afraid still remains. I guessed
R. Random to be his, though without his name. I cannot think Ferdinand
Fathom wrote by the same hand, it is every way so much
below it. Sally Fielding has mended her style in her last volume of
David Simple, which conveys a useful moral, though she does not
seem to have intended it: I mean, shews the ill consequences of not
providing against casual losses, which happen to almost everybody.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Mrs. Orgueil's character is well drawn, and is frequently to be met
with. The Art of Tormenting, the Female Quixote, and Sir C. Goodville,
are all sale work. I suppose they proceed from her pen, and I
heartily pity her, constrained by her circumstances to seek her bread
by a method, I do not doubt, she despises. Tell me who is that
accomplished countess she celebrates. I left no such person in London;
nor can I imagine who is meant by the English Sappho mentioned
in Betsy Thoughtless, whose adventures, and those of Jemmy
Jessamy, gave me some amusement. I was better entertained by the
valet, who very fairly represents how you are bought and sold by your
servants. I am now so accustomed to another manner of treatment,
it would be difficult to me to suffer them: his adventures have the
uncommon merit of ending in a surprising manner. The general want
of invention which reigns among our writers inclines me to think it is
not the natural growth of our island, which has not sun enough to warm
the imagination. The press is loaded by the servile flock of imitators.
Lord Bolingbroke would have quoted Horace in this place. Since I
was born, no original has appeared excepting Congreve, and Fielding,
who would, I believe, have approached nearer to his excellencies, if
not forced, by necessity, to publish without correction, and throw
many productions into the world, he would have thrown into the fire,
if meat could have been got without money, or money without scribbling.
The greatest virtue, justice, and the most distinguishing prerogative
of mankind, writing, when duly executed, do honour to human
nature; but, when degenerated into trades, are the most contemptible
ways of getting bread. I am sorry not to see any more of
Peregrine Pickle's performances; I wish you would tell me his name!"</p>

<p>An ancestor of Lord Moira was capable of making a nice distinction:</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"I cannot believe Sir John's advancement is owing
to his merit, tho' he certainly deserves such a distinction; but I am persuaded
the present disposers of such dignitys are neither more clear-sighted,
or more disinterested than their predecessors. Even since I knew
the world, Irish patents have been hung out to sale, like the laced
and embroidered coats in Monmouth-street, and bought up by the
same sort of people; I mean those who had rather wear shabby
finery than no finery at all; though I don't suppose this was Sir
John's case. That <i>good creature</i>, (as the country saying is,) has not
a bit of pride about him. I dare swear he purchased his title for
the same reason he used to purchase pictures in Italy; not because
he wanted to buy, but because somebody or other wanted to sell.
He hardly ever opened his mouth but to say 'What you please, sir;'&mdash;'Your
humble servant;' or some gentle expression to the same
effect. It is scarce credible that with this unlimited complaisance
he should draw a blow upon himself; yet it so happened that one of
his own countrymen was brute enough to strike him. As it was done
before many witnesses, Lord Mansel heard of it; and thinking that
if poor Sir John took no notice of it, he would suffer daily insults
of the same kind, out of pure good nature resolved to spirit him
up, at least to some shew of resentment, intending to make up the
matter afterwards in as honourable a manner as he could for the
poor patient. He represented to him very warmly that no gentleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
could take a box on the ear. Sir John answered with great
calmness, 'I know that, but this was not a box on the ear, it was
only a slap o' the face.'"</p>

<p>The following is a smart sketch&mdash;perhaps a little too piquant:</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"Next to the great ball, what makes the most noise
is the marriage of an old maid, who lives in this street, without a portion, to a man of
7,000<i>l.</i> <i>per annum</i>, and they say 40,000<i>l.</i> in ready money.
Her equipage and liveries outshine any body's in town. He has presented her
with 3,000<i>l.</i> in jewels; and never was man more smitten with these
charms that had lain invisible for these forty years; but, with all his
glory, never bride had fewer enviers, the dear beast of a man is so
filthy, frightful, odious, and detestable. I would turn away such a
footman for fear of spoiling my dinner, while he waited at table.
They were married on Friday, and came to church <i>en parade</i> on
Sunday. I happened to sit in the pew with them, and had the
honour of seeing Mrs. Bride fall fast asleep in the middle of the
sermon, and snore very comfortably; which made several women
in the church think the bridegroom not quite so ugly as they did before.
Envious people say 'twas all counterfeited to please him, but
I believe that to be scandal; for I dare swear, nothing but downright
necessity could make her miss one word of the sermon. He professes
to have married her for her devotion, patience, meekness, and
other Christian virtues he observed in her: his first wife (who has
left no children) being very handsome, and so good-natured as to
have ventured her own salvation to secure his. He has married this
lady to have a companion in that paradise where his first has given
him a title. I believe I have given you too much of this couple;
but they are not to be comprehended in few words.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"My dear Mrs. Hewet, remember me and believe that
nothing can put you out of my head."</p>

<p class="indent">The noble dukes of the present day, and the learned members of
the faculty, are by no means of so sportive a turn as they were in the
goodly times of Mrs. Hewet. We confess we should like to have to
get up some fine morning to be in St. James's Park in time to see
some such elegant struggle between the Duke of Devonshire and Sir
Henry Halford as the following:</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"There is another story that I had from a hand I dare
depend upon. The Duke of Grafton and Dr. Garth ran a foot-match in the
Mall of 200 yards, and the latter, to his immortal glory, beat."</p>

<p>With a strong turn for building herself, Lady Mary makes some
sensible remarks on its folly in others.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"Building is the general weakness of old people; I
have had a twitch of it myself, though certainly it is the highest absurdity,
and as sure a proof of dotage as pink-coloured ribands, or even matrimony.
Nay, perhaps, there is more to be said in defence of the last; I mean
in a childless old man; he may prefer a boy born in his own house,
though he knows it is not his own, to disrespectful or worthless nephews
or nieces. But there is no excuse for beginning an edifice he
can never inhabit, or probably see finished. The Duchess of Marlborough
used to ridicule the vanity of it, by saying one might always
live upon other people's follies: yet you see she built the most ridiculous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
house I ever saw, since it really is not habitable, from the excessive
damps; so true it is, the things that we would do, those do we
not, and the things we would not do, those do we daily. I feel in
myself a proof of this assertion, being much against my will at Venice,
though I own it is the only great town where I can properly reside, yet
here I find so many vexations, that, in spite of all my philosophy, and
(what is more powerful,) my phlegm, I am oftner out of humour than
among my plants and poultry in the country. I cannot help being
concerned at the success of iniquitous schemes, and grieve for oppressed
merit. You, who see these things every day, think me as unreasonable,
in making them matter of complaint, as if I seriously
lamented the change of seasons. You should consider I have lived
almost a hermit ten years, and the world is as new to me as to a
country girl transported from Wales to Coventry. I know I ought to
think my lot very good, that can boast of some sincere friends among
strangers."</p>

<p class="indent">But we must put an end to this agreeable conference,&mdash;though
we think, that if we could for ever listen to such vivid gossip, we should
never grow old. We had intended to have treated of the romantic
intimacy, and subsequent determined hatred, that existed between
Lady Mary and Pope; but our limits warn us that we must not
indulge in a lengthy discussion of the subject. She, it is clear, was
flattered by his wit and his mental beauty. In him real passion took
root. His advances she appears to have repulsed, and he was thus
suddenly driven to the galling contemplation of his own person, and
he at once from the adoring poet became the "Deformed Transformed"
into hate itself. Byron never forgave an allusion to his
lameness. The separation of Mr. Wortley from his accomplished
wife still remains unexplained; but it is clear that kindly and
respectful feelings were preserved unblemished between them; and there is
a delicate tenderness in each towards the other in the veriest trifles,
which shows how feeble a thing is absence over sincere affections.
We are rather surprised that no letters from Lady Mary to her
grand-daughter Lady Jane, (one of the daughters of the Countess of
Bute,) have not straggled into print. How beautifully must she
have written to children, and particularly to such a child as Lady
Jane appears to have been! The letters, however, we fear are lost.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">If we might be permitted to adopt a new manner of
life, and to pitch our tent in whatever part of his Majesty's dominions we
pleased,&mdash;we have no hesitation in saying that we should lose no time in
directing <i>those people</i>, however respectable they may be, who inhabit
Strawberry Hill, to <i>get out</i>! We should then send down by the
Twickenham carrier complete sets of the works of Pope, Swift, Johnny
Gay, and the dear Arbuthnot,&mdash;of the Letters of Horace Walpole, of
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Pepys' Memoirs, Evelyn's Memoirs,
Shakspeare, and some other works of trifling interest,&mdash;begging they may
be placed in <i>that</i> little library with the stained glass. We should
then Ourselves go down!&mdash;have a comfortable annuity from government,
and a moderate handful of servants from the neighbourhood;
and there we would pass away our life, "from morn to noon,&mdash;from
noon to dewy eve,&mdash;a summer's day!" This plan has something in
it so modest and reasonable, that we cannot help thinking it will attract
the attention of the existing ministry, and in the end be realized!

<h2>THEATRICAL ADVERTISEMENT, EXTRAORDINARY.</h2>

<p class="blockquot indent space-above2 space-below2">
[As we might reasonably be expected to account
for the possession of the following document, we beg to state that it was
put into our hands by an unknown gentleman, who slipped unseen
into our <i>sanctum</i>, clothed in a whity-brown suit, half-boots,
and blue cotton stockings. The gentleman apologized for the
negligence of his attire, by stating that he was in "reduced"
circumstances. His employers, he said, had hit upon an ingenious
mode of reimbursing themselves for the losses they sustained by
trading under the market price,&mdash;which was simply paying their
workmen one half of their wages, and owing them the other. On
our inquiring with great sympathy, whether he was not desirous
to get the last-mentioned moiety, he replied with real feeling,
that he wished he might. He then begged the loan of a small
pinch of snuff, sighed deeply, and withdrew.&mdash;
<span class="smcap">Ed. B. M.</span>]</p>

<p class="indent">Messrs. Four, Two, and One, many years resident on the
Surrey side of the river Thames, beg most respectfully to announce to the
play-going public, that in consequence of the increasing demand for
all sorts of low-priced theatrical articles, they have at length succeeded
in securing and entering upon those large, commodious, and formerly
well-known high-priced premises situate in Drury-lane and Covent-garden;
and having by this arrangement prevented the possibility
of competition, they are determined to do business in future upon
the Surrey-side system only. To prove the sincerity of their intentions,
Four, Two, and One take this opportunity of making known to
the directors of theatrical establishments, that they have a number of
hints ready cut and dried, upon the necessity of a general reduction of
the salaries of the principal <span class="smcap">English</span> <i>artistes</i>,
which will be found singularly useful to managers taking a Continental trip
for the purpose of securing <span class="smcap">Foreign</span> talent for the
London market.</p>

<p class="indent">F. T. and O. also recommend their celebrated elastic, self-acting,
portable, Anglo-Parisian pen, skilfully contrived to fit all hands, and
which enables the writer, after six lessons upon the Hamiltonian system,
to translate any French piece into <i>Surrey-side English</i>; thereby
superseding the necessity of employing and paying any author
or adapter who thinks it worth his while to embarrass himself with
the study of reading, writing, or any other abstruse or outlandish
knowledge whatsoever.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">F. T. and O. cannot conclude without returning their
most sincere and heartfelt thanks to the nobility, gentry, and friends of the drama
generally, by whom their endeavours have been so eminently patronized.
In particular, they should consider themselves guilty of the
grossest ingratitude, did they omit this occasion of acknowledging their
infinite obligations to the proprietors of the Patent establishments,
who (by their active zeal, and indefatigable industry in the
great cause of general reduction,) have placed Four, Two, and One, in
their present premises, and have thereby enforced and illustrated this
incontrovertible fact,&mdash;that Sheridan, Harris, and Colman were mere
humbugs and imposters compared with F. T. and O.; and, that during
their long and high-priced professional career, they did nothing to
obtain or preserve the protection of a candid and enlightened public.

<h2>EDWARD SAVILLE.</h2>
<p class="f110">A TRANSCRIPT. BY CHARLES WHITEHEAD.</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">The doctor tells me I must take no wine. Pshaw! It is not that
which mounts into my brain; and sometimes&mdash;but I must not wander&mdash;wine
is the best corrector of these fancies. One bottle more
of sober claret, and I shall be able to finish before midnight the brief
sketch of my life which I promised Travers long ago.</p>

<p class="indent">It were worse than useless to set down any particulars of
my boyhood. An only son is usually a spoiled one, and that which is so
easy and delightful a task to most parents was by no means difficult
or unpleasant to mine; and yet, to do myself justice, I believe I was
not more conceited, insolent, selfish, and rapacious than others are
during those days of innocence, as they are called,&mdash;those days of
innocence which form the germ of that noble and disinterested
creature, man.</p>

<p class="indent">At the age of three-and-twenty I succeeded to my father's
estate. It was to divert a sense of loneliness which beset me, that I
plunged into&mdash;as they term it, but the phrase is a wrong one&mdash;that
I ventured upon the course of folly and dissipation into which so
many young men of fortune like myself hurry themselves, or are led,
or are driven. But why recount these scenes of pleasure&mdash;so called,
or miscalled&mdash;whose reaction is utter weariness, satiety, and disgust?</p>

<p class="indent">I was at the theatre one night, when the friend who accompanied
me directed my attention to a very lovely girl, who, with her mother
and a party of friends, occupied the next box. She was, certainly,
the loveliest creature my eyes had ever lighted upon; with a sylph-like
form, (that is the usual phrase, I believe,) wanting perhaps that
complete roundness of limb which is considered essential to perfect
beauty in a woman&mdash;but she was barely sixteen&mdash;and yet suggesting,
too, the idea of consummate symmetry. Her face&mdash;but who
can describe beauty? who even can paint it? Let any man look at
the finest attempts to achieve this impossibility by the old masters,
and then let him compare them with the faces he has seen, and may
see every day. Heavens! what inanities! Can a man paint a soul
upon canvass? And yet the artist talks of his "expression."</p>

<p class="indent">I watched her closely during the performance,&mdash;indeed,
I had no power to withdraw my gaze from her; and once or twice her eyes
met mine, and I thought I could perceive she was not altogether
displeased at my attention. Her confusion betrayed that to me, and
in one short hour I was a lost man.</p>

<p class="indent">When the play was over, I framed a miserable excuse,
which I thought at the time a most ingenious one, to my friend for not
accompanying him home to supper, as I had promised; and hastening
after my unknown and her mother, who had left the box, was just in
time to see them enter a coach. I contrived to keep pace with it,
and saw it deposit its beautiful freight at a house in a small private
street near Portman Square.</p>

<p class="indent">I could laugh&mdash;unaccustomed as I am even to private laughing
now-a-days&mdash;when I think, as I do sometimes, on those days of sentiment.
It were as futile to attempt to renew that sentiment after
thirty, as to strive to recal those days, and to bid them stand in next
year's calendar. The green wood is out of the tree by that time;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and the trunk becomes hard, and gnarled, and stubborn. Now is the
time to enjoy life. At five-and-thirty the blood and the brain act in
concert, and the heart beats not one pulse the quicker, while they do
their spiriting&mdash;not gently always.&mdash;To return.</p>

<p class="indent">I went home that night altogether an altered man, and
rose next morning from a sleepless bed, absorbed with the one idea which had
worked so miraculous a change within me. All that day, almost
without intermission, did I pace up and down the street in the hope of
seeing her; but in vain. Not once did she approach the window;
and I did not deem it prudent to question one of the servants who
came out of the house several times during the day. I betook myself,
therefore, towards evening to a green-grocer's shop in the neighbourhood;
and the purchase of some fruit gave me a privilege to indulge
in a little chat with the good old woman who conducted the
business. I affected to be chiefly solicitous respecting the elderly
lady, whom I had seen by chance, and believed to be a friend of my
father, but whose name I could not, for the life of me, remember.
The old woman smiled at my shallow artifice, but proceeded to inform
me that the elderly lady was the widow of an officer who had been
killed in the Peninsular War, leaving an only daughter, at that period
an infant. I begged pardon&mdash;the name? did she know the daughter's name?</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh yes! it was Isabella Denham."</p>

<p class="indent">It was an era in my life, the first sound of that name.
I thanked my kind informant, and withdrew.</p>

<p class="indent">I need not tell how unremittingly, and for how many weeks,
I paced up and down that street, with various success; how regularly I attended
the church she frequented; and how at length I obtained an
introduction to the family.</p>

<p class="indent">I found Isabella Denham more captivating than the accumulated
fancies and self-willed convictions of months had pictured her to me.
It is no unusual result in such cases; but whether it be that the object
transcends the imagination, or that the imagination subserves the
object, I know not. It was so, however; for feeling upon these occasions
takes the place of reason, which is an impertinence.</p>

<p class="indent">Let me be just. I think, had I loved Isabella Denham less,
I should equally have admired her. She had a mind and a heart; she was
accomplished; she was beautiful, gentle, and good; and she loved
me. Yes, she loved me. I believed it then, and I am certain of it
now. How I loved her, she never knew: that was for Time to show,
and he has shown it.</p>

<p class="indent">I offered her my hand in due time, and was accepted. How I
despised the sneers and banter of some of my friends who could
not conceive the idea of a marriage with fortune on one side, and
none on the other, and yet were endeavouring at the same time
to effect an engagement of a similar nature in their own favour!
How I disregarded the gratuitous advice of sundry of my officious
relatives, who thought that all love had died when their own gave up
the ghost, and who sometimes prophesied truly because they were
always prognosticating evil!</p>

<p class="indent">We were at length married; and the close of the fourth
year saw no diminution of our happiness. We were domestic enough without
seclusion, and went into as much company as sufficed to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
us feel that home was the happiest place after all. One circumstance
had contributed to augment my felicity,&mdash;the birth of a son,
which took place about a year after our marriage.</p>

<p class="indent">I know not what some people mean, who tell you that when
a man becomes married, love subsides into affection, and friendship
takes the place of passion. It was not so with me. I loved the
wife as much as I had adored the mistress. To make her happy
was myself to be so; and to have made her so, I would have laid
down my life. Some, indeed, hinted that I indulged her too much&mdash;that
I let her have her own way in everything. And why not?
Did I marry to make my wife the creature, or the slave, of some
system of management, rule of action, or principle of conduct?
phrases which I abhor. No&mdash;no; be they as wise as they will, I
was right. I am convinced of it. <i>That</i> was not the cause.
We were happy.</p>

<p class="indent">It was by the merest chance that I one day encountered
Hastings in the street&mdash;my friend Hastings. We had been companions at
Eton, and at college our intimacy had grown into friendship. Were
I now asked for what particular quality of mind or heart I had chosen
Hastings for a friend, I should find some difficulty in answering the
question. He was what is termed "a good-natured fellow;" there
was nothing gross or offensive in his gaiety, and he was always the
same. His feelings never led him to make a fool of himself which is
much to say of a young man. They might be called good <i>plated</i>
feelings, which answered the purpose well enough, and sometimes
passed for more costly articles. It is much, after all, to possess a
friend between whom and yourself you can drew comparisons favourable
to the latter, and who is perfectly content that you should do so.</p>

<p class="indent">He dined with me on the next day. His powers of conversation
were certainly much improved since we had last talked together. He
could turn the most superficial reading to admirable account; and so
minute was his observation, and so faithfully and graphically could he
describe manners, and the surface motives of men, that it almost
appeared like a profound knowledge of mankind. Isabella was pleased
with his society; and after she had retired to the drawing-room, my
friend expatiated somewhat at large upon her beauty and elegance,
and, above all, upon the good sense which characterised her. I need
hardly say that I also was delighted with him, and when we shook
hands for the night, I could have hugged the man for his glowing
eulogy. I almost loved every one who admired her. I was too
weak&mdash;too weak.</p>

<p class="indent">He visited us often, for his time was altogether his own.
He was living upon expectancy, and accordingly had more leisure than money.
At various periods I pressed him to make my purse his own,
and he did so. I had, indeed, more money at my disposal than I
cared for, or knew what to do with; and at that time I thought, when
I served a friend, that I had found the best employment of it. It is
strange,&mdash;and yet perhaps it is not by any means strange,&mdash;how men
alter in this particular as they grow older. The heart-strings and the
purse-strings are not so easily drawn then.</p>

<p class="indent">Well, I was his banker, and felt myself sufficiently repaid
by his society. About this time, also, I was greatly occupied in business of
a somewhat troublesome nature, to conclude which it was necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
that I should visit my estate. My probable term of absence was to
be about six weeks. The fashionable season was in its meridian, and
I could not be cruel enough to ask Isabella to accompany me. She
had latterly taken more pleasure in parties, and balls, and concerts
than heretofore. Perhaps I had kept her too close; we were too domestic.
After all, it was not the way of the world. I thought so,
and Hastings agreed with me;&mdash;I would see it reformed altogether
when I return.</p>

<p class="indent">In the mean while I begged Hastings to look in now and then,
and see that she was not lonely and out of spirits. It was natural to expect
that my first absence from her would cause her to feel so. He
promised to do as I requested, and I set off into the country, where I
was detained more than two months; and at length, finding myself
released from an irksome attendance on very unpleasant business, I
took post-horses, and with all the ardour of a lover returned to
London.</p>

<p class="indent">I returned to London.&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">I remember the minutest particulars of that scene so well!
Not a tittle of it has escaped my memory&mdash;not a word, not a syllable! It
will never depart from my mind&mdash;from my soul!</p>

<p class="indent">When the porter opened the door, I hastened through the hall,
and sprang up stairs into the drawing-room. She was not there; but my
little boy, hearing my well-known footstep, came from the adjoining
room and ran towards me. I caught him in my arms, and gave him a thousand kisses.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, my dear little fellow, and where is mamma?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not here&mdash;not here," said the boy, looking around;
"but I'm so glad you've come back!"</p>

<p class="indent">Isabella was gone out, doubtless. I rang the bell. I did not
observe Mrs. Martin, the housekeeper, enter the room,&mdash;I was still
caressing the child.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ha! Mrs. Martin&mdash;But what's the matter?
You look ill.&mdash;Where is Mrs. Saville?"</p>

<p class="indent">The woman spoke not, but trembled violently, and turned
very pale. I motioned her to take a seat. She did so.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear madam, you alarm me," said I. "Is anything
wrong&mdash;your mistress&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Tears were streaming down the woman's face, as she arose
suddenly, and with her hands clasped before her she came towards me.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, sir! bear it like a man," she cried, weeping bitterly;&mdash;"do
bear it like a man, sir! That I should live to tell you this!&mdash;I, who
have carried you in these arms, and have prayed a thousand times for
your happiness when I should be dead and gone!"</p>

<p class="indent">She paused. Perhaps my face revealed the sickness of heart
which at that moment overcame me. I could not rise from my seat; I
could not lift the child from my knee, as he lay upon my bosom with
his head pressed against my heart.</p>

<p class="indent">"Merciful Heaven!&mdash;Isabella is ill&mdash;she is
dying!&mdash;at once, at once tell me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no," said the woman bitterly, "she is not ill or dying.
Mr. Saville, I durst not tell you my suspicions before you left town&mdash;I
durst not, sir. For mercy's sake compose yourself! My mistress left
this house last Tuesday night with Mr. Hastings."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">That horrible shriek still rings in my ears. I remember
thrusting the child from me, and clasping my head with my hands; and then I
was smitten down&mdash;struck to the earth&mdash;worse than dead&mdash;oh, how
much worse than dead!</p>

<p class="indent">It was a long, long, hideous dream that succeeded, full of
woe, and lamentations, and weeping, and curses, and despair. But I awoke at
last from that dream. Where was I? It was a very narrow, but
lofty room; the walls were whitewashed, and there was one small
window about twelve feet from the door. I was seated on a low
truckle-bed; and as I turned my eyes from the light of the window,
they fell upon my hands, which were laid before me. Around my
wrists there were deep marks, as though they had been tied together
with cords; and when I moved, a sharp pain went round me, like a
girdle. But the rope had been loosened, and was no longer about me.
A man entered the room.</p>

<p class="indent">"How do you feel yourself now?" said he,
laying his hand upon my shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">I looked up. Methought I recognised the voice,
and the face was almost familiar to me, and repulsively so.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am well&mdash;very well," I answered. "Where am I?"</p>

<p class="indent">The man said nothing, but silently left the room,
presently returning with a gentleman, of whom, as of the man, I had an
indistinct remembrance.</p>

<p class="indent">"You will be better soon, sir," said this person kindly,
as he felt my pulse; and he turned towards the man, and spoke to him in an
undertone. "Let him be kept very quiet," was all I heard, and he
retired shortly after.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes:&mdash;I had been mad&mdash;raving mad&mdash;for two years,
and was now slowly struggling back into consciousness. Feeble glimmerings of the
past came upon me at first, and then farther half-revelations were
extended to me; until at length <i>the cause</i>, dimly and remotely,
but gradually nearer and more near, stood before me like a curse. It is
well for me that I did not then relapse into madness; but I wrestled
with it, I overcame it, and in a month was taken away in my own
physician's carriage, and brought back home. Home?&mdash;that had
been destroyed.</p>

<p class="indent">My friend, Dr. Herbert, was, and is, the best fellow
breathing. He devoted for some weeks nearly the whole of his time to me. He
endeavoured to draw my mind away from the one subject, which might,
he thought, if entertained, once more overthrow my reason. He was
mistaken. The very endeavour to discard that memory, as often as it
recurred, would soon have distracted me. I encouraged it, therefore,
and was strengthened by it;&mdash;my mind throve upon it,&mdash;it was
a comfort to me.</p>

<p class="indent">The many slight indications of an attachment&mdash;of a
passion&mdash;between <i>her</i> and this man Hastings,&mdash;and they must have
been but slight indications,&mdash;were presented to me now grossly and palpably.
I could see them all,&mdash;they stung me;&mdash;and I would curse my fool's
nature that was blind, or would not see and provide against the
consequence. And why did I curse my easy nature? Could I have
borne to live a wretched turnkey, a miserable listener at key-holes, a
dealer out of "punishment, the drudgery of devils?" Did I marry
to suspect virtue, or to control vice? Neither; and I was glad that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
when they did wrong me, they permitted me to know it. These
thoughts never affected my brain;&mdash;there was no fear of that. I
thought no longer from the brain;&mdash;these thoughts were in my heart,
and never moved thence.</p>

<p class="indent">One evening, as I was ascending the stairs, I overheard
the child inquiring of one of the servants "who that white-haired gentleman
was, and why he lived in the house?" I had hitherto refused to see
the child; but I now rang the bell, and ordered the housekeeper, who
constantly waited upon me, to bring him to me.</p>

<p class="indent">He was much grown since I had last seen him, and was a fine
boy. He did not know me, and was at first fearful of approaching me; but I
induced him to sit upon my knee, and, putting his hair from the forehead,
asked him if he would not give me a kiss. As he lifted his face,
and looked up at me&mdash;that look! his very mother was gazing through
those eyes! A sudden faintness possessed me. I lifted the child
gently from my knee, and motioned the housekeeper to take him from
my sight. I did not see him again.</p>

<p class="indent">But there was comfort still:&mdash;Hastings was in
London,&mdash;I was certain of it.</p>

<p class="indent">And so he was. One night, about a fortnight after my return
to town from Paris, where I was told he had been seen, and where I had
sought him in vain, I was proceeding home, baffled in my endeavours
to discover him in some of his old haunts, which I had ascertained after
many and fruitless inquiries. I was walking rapidly down a miserable
street in the vicinity of Clare Market, when a squalid wretch, issuing
from a public-house, came in contact with me. I think no human being
in the world would have recognised him but myself. Hideously changed
as he was, I knew him instantly. The half-shriek that burst from him
as he recoiled from me showed that he had recognised me also. The
struggle was a short one,&mdash;I had omitted to put my pistols in my
pocket on that evening. With what a savage triumph, when I had
dashed him on the pavement, did I stamp upon the prostrate carcass
of the groaning wretch! But my joy was brief; for I was suddenly
seized by three or four men, who held me firmly by the arms. I could
not get at him. Heedless of my ravings, they assisted the miscreant
to rise, who, casting one glance of terror towards me, darted down an
alley, and was lost to me for ever. He had escaped me.</p>

<p class="indent">How I reached home I know not. Herbert, who visited me
next morning, forbade me to rise from my bed. He said my brain was
unsettled, and I believe it was. But I was well again in a month.</p>

<p class="indent">The one idea pervaded my whole being when I arose from
my bed. My rencontre with Hastings had whetted my appetite for revenge so
keenly, that no reason, no thought, no feeling could control me. He
was evidently in a state of the most abject beggary and want. That
conviction did not disarm me; it rendered me only the more determined
and inflexible.</p>

<p class="indent">I went forth one evening, and with much difficulty discovered
the public-house from which I had seen him emerge on <i>that</i> night. From
the landlord I obtained every particular I required to know. Hastings
had, it seemed, changed his name;&mdash;it was now Harris. He resided
in one small room on the first floor of a house in a filthy court hard
by; that is, if he had not left the neighbourhood, for the man had not
seen him for a month past.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">It was well. I drank two glasses of brandy, for it was a cold
night, and proceeded towards my destination. I found it easily. There was
a light in the window, and, from the reflection of a man's figure on
the wall, I judged he was at home. The house-door was open, and I
entered the narrow passage. At that moment I trembled, and for an
instant could not proceed. No: it was not that which made me
tremble; I knew, and was prepared for, what I had to do. It was
the other,&mdash;it was that face which I feared I could not bear to behold.</p>

<p class="indent">This was, as I have said, the weakness of a moment.
I mounted the stairs, and burst into the room suddenly. A man and a woman
were seated at a small fire, who arose abruptly on my entrance. It
was not Harris and&mdash;his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where is the man&mdash;Hastings?" I exclaimed,
addressing the old couple.</p>

<p class="indent">As I uttered these words, a loud shriek proceeded from a
bed behind me, and a female dropt upon the floor. I knew that voice,&mdash;I
knew it well;&mdash;but it did not move me.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mrs. Harris is ill," said the old woman; "permit us to pass
you, sir;&mdash;it is one of the fits to which she is subject."</p>

<p class="indent">I allowed the woman to step by me, who, raising the
lifeless form beside her, drew it into an adjoining room.</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you want, sir? what is your business here?"
inquired the man.</p>

<p class="indent">I placed one hand into my coat-pocket and grasped a
pistol, and with the other seized the man by the collar.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where is Harris?" said I. "You had best tell me; you are a
dead man else. He is hid somewhere&mdash;he is below, in the house&mdash;where
is he?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He is there," gasped the man; and he pointed towards the bed,
upon which a body was lying, covered with a linen cloth.</p>

<p class="indent">I sank upon a chair. Hastings had indeed escaped me, and for
ever. I was left alone, for the man had hurried from the room. I
cannot describe the agony of feeling which I underwent during the
next half-hour. I took the light, and, walking to the bed, drew the
linen cloth from the face of the corpse.</p>

<p class="indent">How awful! how mysterious is the power of death! The man who
had insulted, who had wronged, who had betrayed me,&mdash;whose ingratitude&mdash;of
all crimes the vilest and the basest&mdash;had inverted my very
soul,&mdash;this man lay before me cold, serene, tranquil, miserable, callously
insensible,&mdash;and yet I had no power to curse him. There was
no serenity, no tranquillity upon the face, when I gazed upon it more
closely. The brow was corrugated, the cheeks collapsed, and the
eyelids sunken; and there was the soul's torture, as it left a tortured
body impressed upon the face. Enough to have mitigated a
more implacable hatred than mine!</p>

<p class="indent">I left the room, and walked down stairs. As I proceeded
along the passage, the man whom I had before seen came out of a lower room,
and opened the door for me. I was about to depart, when he caught
me gently but firmly by the arm.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, sir!" said he earnestly, "do not leave the house
without seeing Mrs. Harris. She has relapsed into another fit; but when she
comes to herself, it will be a comfort to her to see a friend of her
husband. You knew him, sir, when living; and for his sake, perhaps&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the man paused for a moment, and continued,&mdash;"you have a benevolent
heart, sir,&mdash;I am sure you have,&mdash;and if you knew all, even
though he may have wronged you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">It was an unseasonable time for an appeal of this nature.
The passions that had been forced back upon my heart had yet scarce begun
to subside, but I spoke calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">"You will tell her Mr. Saville has been here;" and I was going.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Saville!" repeated the man. "Oh, sir, we have heard that
name mentioned frequently of late. You will come again, or send,
perhaps;&mdash;will you not, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She will know where to find me, should she wish to see me,
which I think is hardly probable;" and with a cold "good-night" I left him.</p>

<p class="indent">I called upon Herbert on my way home, and told him all that had
taken place. He was surprised and shocked.</p>

<p class="indent">"Saville," said he, after a long pause, during which he
had been absorbed in reflection, "this cursed affair is destroying you. I am a
plain man. You may shake your head, and tell me coolly and calmly
that you have ceased to feel the injury which all the while is preying
upon you. It is that calmness which I fear most; it will kill you,
or worse than that,&mdash;you understand me. You must pursue this matter
no farther. The man is dead, and your wife &mdash;&mdash; Well," he resumed,
"I beg your pardon; I was wrong to call her by that name. May I
speak plainly?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You may."</p>

<p class="indent">"She is evidently in a state of want&mdash;of destitution. This
must not be. You must allow her&mdash;settle upon her&mdash;enough to rescue her
from poverty and its temptations. She must not starve;&mdash;I see you
could not bear that. And you must forget her. It will not do to see
a young man like yourself sacrificed, self-sacrificed, to the villany of
a scoundrel. I will say no more, Saville. Vice has too much homage
paid to her when an honourable man is made her victim."</p>

<p class="indent">Herbert was right&mdash;he was always so. No, no;&mdash;she
must not starve. That were indeed a miserable triumph to me. I went to my
solicitor on the next morning, and a deed was made out, settling a
competence upon her, and I sent with it as much money as she could
require for immediate exigencies. And I was resolved that I would
forget her. The worst was past, and time and occupation would do
much, and I would think this misery down. But the worst was not yet past.</p>

<p class="indent">I was informed, one morning, that a woman in the hall
desired to speak with me. Concluding that she was one of the many persons
who are accustomed to wait upon the wealthy with petitions, I ordered
the servant to admit her. A woman meanly dressed, and whose countenance
was concealed, moved towards me, and sinking upon her
knees, with her palms pressed together and raised towards me, looked
up into my face. Madness in me, and misery and famine in her, must
have wrought more strongly, if that were possible, than they had done,
could I have failed to recognise that face instantly. Her lips moved,&mdash;she
would have spoken, but she had no power to speak,&mdash;and with a
deep and heavy groan she fell upon the floor before me. I rang the
bell violently. A servant entered the room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Send Mrs. Martin to me instantly. Mrs. Martin," said I,
as the woman hastened into the room, "let Dr. Herbert be sent for immediately.
You must take care of her. See that she wants nothing."</p>

<p class="indent">"Gracious God! it is my mistress!" said the woman, as she
raised her head upon her knee. "You will let her remain in the house,
Mr. Saville?&mdash;in one of the upper rooms?"</p>

<p class="indent">"In her own room, Mrs. Martin.&mdash;I commit her to you.
When she recovers, we can make other arrangements."</p>

<p class="indent">It is out of the power of fortune or of fate to excite
such feelings within me now as pressed upon my heart for some days after
this scene. I thank God for it. Human strength or weakness could not
again endure so dreadful a conflict of brute passion and of human
feeling. That piteous face raised to mine would not depart from me.
That she should kneel,&mdash;that she should have been degraded abjectly
to crouch before me for forgiveness, for pardon, for the vilest pity,&mdash;and
that I should know and feel that the base expiation was the
poorest recompense&mdash;oh! I cannot pursue this farther.</p>

<p class="indent">Some days after this,&mdash;it was on a Sunday forenoon,&mdash;
Mrs. Martin entered the room. She took a seat opposite to me.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am come to speak with you, Mr. Saville," she said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, madam, proceed."</p>

<p class="indent">"Mrs. Saville, my mistress, sir, is dying."</p>

<p class="indent">I spoke not for some minutes, although I was not
altogether unprepared for a communication of this nature.</p>

<p class="indent">"You will take the child to her, madam; she will wish to see him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, sir, she has seen him every day since she came here,
and he is with her now. You will not be offended, sir, if I tell you that she
has seen him many times within the last two years. Yes, sir, when
you were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Mad, madam!&mdash;speak plainly!&mdash;I <i>was</i> mad."</p>

<p class="indent">"She came, sir, to me, and fell at my feet, imploring to
see the child, and I could not refuse her. I could not bear that my mistress
should kneel to me, and not be permitted to behold her own son;" and
here the woman wept bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is very well," said I, after a pause; "I do not blame
you. It is better, perhaps, that it should have been so."</p>

<p class="indent">"Could I prevail upon you, sir?" she continued, wiping her eyes;
"might I be so bold as to hope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">I anticipated the woman's thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">"She has expressed no wish that I should see her, Mrs. Martin."</p>

<p class="indent">"She does not mention your name even to me," said she; "but
she must not die without seeing you;&mdash;she <i>must</i> not, Mr. Saville."</p>

<p class="indent">My nature at times was changed from what it had been since
I was released from the mad-house. I cast a glance at the woman, which
she understood and feared.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mention not this subject again, madam, and leave me.
I would be alone."</p>

<p class="indent">I was disturbed by what the housekeeper had told me. She was
dying. It was well. I wished her to die. I felt that until she was
dead, my heart could not be brought to forgive her.</p>

<p class="indent">I walked out, and bent my steps towards the lodging which
Hastings had formerly occupied. I found the woman of the house at home,
and, with a calmness which I have since marvelled at, I drew from
her all the particulars of their sojourn at her house. They had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
living with her about ten months before the death of Hastings, who,
she understood, had been entirely deserted by his relations, but why
she knew not. About a month previous to the decease of Hastings,
he came home one night, saying that he had been waylaid by a ruffian
and much injured, and he had never risen from his bed again.</p>

<p class="indent">I ventured to ask "if Mr. Harris and his wife
lived happily together?"</p>

<p class="indent">The woman shook her head. "There was a strange mystery
about them," said she, "which I never could rightly make out. She was
ever gentle and obedient; but still there was something unlike a wife,
I used to think, whenever she addressed him. And he, sir,&mdash;poor
man! we should not speak ill of the dead,&mdash;but when he came home&mdash;from
the gaming-house, we often thought&mdash;how he used to strike
and beat her, telling her to go to her Mr. Saville! He was jealous of
you, sir, I suppose, but I am certain without cause; for she was an
angel, sir, if ever angel was born upon this earth.&mdash;But you are ill,
sir. What is the matter?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing, nothing," said I, rising suddenly; "I am better now;"
and pressing my purse upon the woman, I rushed from the house.</p>

<p class="indent">God of justice! how dreadful is thy vengeance, and how
thou oft-times makest the sinner work out his own punishment! I thought not
of the wife at first,&mdash;I thought of Isabella Denham. My heart dwelt
upon her once more as I had first beheld her at the theatre,&mdash;the
young, the lovely, the innocent being of former days. I remembered
when but to see her for a moment at the window was happiness
unspeakable,&mdash;when even the pressure of her hand in mine was a blessing
and a delight to me. And to think that this creature, who had
lain in my bosom, who had been tended, watched, almost served,
with a degree of love akin to idolatry,&mdash;who had never seen one
glance of unkindness from me, who had heard no tone from my lips
save of affection&mdash;too often of foolish weakness;&mdash;to think that this
creature should have become the slave, the drudge,&mdash;the spurned and
beaten drudge of a brutal miscreant,&mdash;the thought was too horrible!</p>

<p class="indent">I had scarcely entered my own house when Mrs. Martin sought me.</p>

<p class="indent">"For mercy's sake, sir!" she said in agitation, "come and take
your last leave of my mistress. She is dying, and has prayed to see
you once more."</p>

<p class="indent">I followed her in silence. I met Herbert at the door
of the room. "I am glad you are come," said he. He was in tears.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am too weak, Herbert; am I not?"</p>

<p class="indent">He pressed my hand,&mdash;"No, no,"&mdash;and he left me.</p>

<p class="indent">I entered the room, and sat down by her side.
She spoke not for some minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wished to see you once more, Mr. Saville," she said at
length in a low tone, and without raising her eyes to my face, "to implore,
not your pardon, for that I dare not expect; but that you will not curse
my memory when I am gone. You would not, Edward,"&mdash;and she
tremblingly touched my hand as it lay upon the bed,&mdash;"if you knew
all, or if I could tell you all."</p>

<p class="indent">I answered something, but I know not what.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have been guilty," she resumed, "but I did not meditate
guilt. Heaven is my witness that I speak the truth. I was betrayed;&mdash;and
the rest was fear, and frenzy, and despair!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">I could conceive that now&mdash;I could believe it:&mdash;
I did believe it,&mdash;and I was human. I took both her hands in mine: "Look at me,
Isabella! look in my face!"</p>

<p class="indent">She did so, but with hesitation, and as she did so she
started.&mdash;"Nay, we are both altered: but other miseries might have done this.
I forgive you from my heart and from my soul. As we first met, so
shall we now part. All shall be forgotten,&mdash;all is forgiven. God bless you!"</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Those words had killed her. Her eyes dwelt
upon me for one moment with their first sweetness in them;&mdash;a
sigh,&mdash;and earth alone remained!</p>

<p class="indent">"Let the tear of sensibility be wiped for the simple Clotilde,
who, fresh as an opening zoöphyte, awoke her aged nurse, Fidgita, to prepare
her for the evening masque; and still the unconscious being warbled,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"While meekly blends the azure dew,</span>
<span class="i2">And starry dawn invests the grove,</span>
<span class="i0">When listening doves in fancy coo,</span>
<span class="i2">O'er faintest dreams by memory wove;</span>
<span class="i0">Then shall the blameless brigand bless</span>
<span class="i2">The suit of his Bohemian fair,</span>
<span class="i0">Or read in every golden tress</span>
<span class="i2">The token flowers of India's air!</span>
<span class="i4">Singing tink a tink, fal lira la,</span>
<span class="i8">Fal lira la, sing tink a tink!"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">"Gramercy!" quoth the garrulous crone, who had numbered
ninety summers; "will my foster babe mock with troubadour odes,
and ballads, and the like, one whose every artery hath hardened into
a tendon? Hear me, wench, and tremble!" In an unearthly and
sepulchral tone, she gutturally muttered the ancient Runic prophecy&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Two children, each of spell-bound mother,</span>
<span class="i0">Shall meet, and one shall love the other;</span>
<span class="i0">But mother young, and mother old,</span>
<span class="i0">Each the blessing shall withhold.</span>
<span class="i0">When by parent's tooth is child's flesh riven,</span>
<span class="i0">When by child's hand, parent hurl'd from heaven,</span>
<span class="i0">Then shall the serfs with joy be tipsy,</span>
<span class="i0">For then shall the robber espouse the gipsy."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The mysterious Fidgita disappeared. Clotilde pondered
o'er the prediction. She was, indeed, a natural daughter of a wealthy baron,
by some beauteous wanderer. The lawless but exemplary
idol of her heart had rescued herself and nurse from these Tartar
hordes, and restored her to her father, in whose halls she had been
received by the Hebrew Duchess Ketura Boaz, and wooed, somewhat
against the will of that mature enchantress, by the Danish Lord
Wooden Murkenhole, whose cause Fidgita had warmly espoused.
Clotilde still stood, clammily clasping her clay-cold hands, as her
sportive Grace tripped into the corridor.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is the Lady Gunterzwartz turned puritan?" she asked with her
wonted wit.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not at all," was the dignified reply; for the high patrician
blood which had descended from the old Romans to our fair papist ill
brooked the familiarity of the Israelitish dame.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lady Clotilde," resumed the Duchess Ketura, playing with
the handle of the dagger which marked her caste, and which, like other
creoles of that region and period, she wore stuck in her plaid bonnet,
"I must tell your ladyship&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing about that Wooden Murkenhole!" interrupted
Clotilde. "Were he a sable pagan Esquimaux bowing to the abominations of
Isis, I could not regard him with more repugnance."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Ha!" laughed her Grace of Boaz, "'tis only when Guzman
sails his gondola beneath the spreading cocoa-trees, and strikes his ganjam
to the praise of thy charms, that thou art pleased, flirting Tory!
Truly, friend Clotilde, I little dreamed, an' please you, when, flying
from the invading Normans, I left the luxurious woods of Dover, and
the contingent mountains of Cheshire, that I should find thee, my
own&mdash;no matter! so unlike in taste to thy hapless&mdash;hush!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Albion!" sighed Clotilde, "decidedly thou must be the
queen of cities. Thy gallant outlaws and highwaymen will with joy the bride
of Guzman greet; for, rather than wive the Rosicrucian Murkenhole,
I will throw myself off Mount Damthopovit, or into the monastery
of St. Kussanblastre."</p>

<p class="indent">"My lovely pupil," said Ketura, "had far better accompany
me to the munchen-hall, where the kooken-vrow is already serving up the
duntarags."</p>

<p class="indent">Clotilde followed her friend. What, then, was her amaze at
finding the phorontrom filled with armed men, headed by the rejected
and vindictive Wooden! To seize his victim; to place her in the fatal
trot-joggeur; to drive across the extensive crags of Smashaltobitz; to
consign her to the dungeons of Glumanough,&mdash;was the work of a moment.
It was not long, however, ere Fidgita apprised the Chevalier
Guzman of his lady's peril: that nobleman, we may well imagine, lost
no time in attempting to succour.</p>

<p class="indent">We must now return to the chateau. Between those fated
women stood the unforgiving one.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mothers both!" he uttered, pointing jocosely. "Mother,
traitress to your son, we part no more. Mother, rival to your daughter, Jewess
or Gingaree, you have lost your Clotilde. Vainly, like your sires, may
you wander crying Chloe! Chloe! till she too is old Clo&mdash;till&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">But we draw the curtain o'er his savage joy. Poison and
poignard had been pacific penances to those he dealt the Duchess, ere, with
delirious haste, he ascended with his wretched parent in the aërial car.
The Lady Ketura, meanwhile, fled to her skiff, which, but for the
incantations of the wizard Gorius, she could not have steered, her wrists
being yet stiff from the thumb-screws applied to extort her unutterable
secret. Thus for weeks did they buffet,&mdash;one with ether, the
other with the waves,&mdash;without touching even earth, much less any
more palatable food. Their squalid tatters spread pestilence around,
and the rage of hunger gnawed them both.</p>

<p class="indent">It was now that the volcano began to spout in tragic lines
of liquid fire: a furious tempest added shipwreck to the scene. A flaming
brand from the irruption lighted on the sail,&mdash;the conflagration
spread,&mdash;a spiral blaze darted on high,&mdash;the roar of combustion
announced that it had ignited the infernal gas, and the accursed aëronaut was
precipitated on the shore. Ketura now remembered how she <i>had</i>
loved, and crawled to kiss the dear perfidious Murkenhole. Bats,
toads, lemurs, owls, snails, spiders, and other reptilous vermin, slimily
beset her loathsome way, gibbering with too intelligible triumph; but,
leaning her back against a rock, and firmly placing her foot before,
she shouted, "Come one, come all! this rock shall fly from its firm
base as soon as Ketura!"</p>

<p class="indent">He of the charmed life had fallen unharmed, and, hearing
this heroic defiance, rushed to consummate his hellish vengeance. But the
Duchess of Boaz anticipated his asking eye. Madly she dashed her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
veined temples against the jagged rock&mdash;all was black darkness.
Wooden hurried forward,&mdash;slipped,&mdash;fell. Was it the ocean foam which
rendered his path precarious? He scooped up some, in the hollow of
his hand, to quench his burning thirst, and lend him voice for one
more vow of hate! Holy nature! his slide was formed of Ketura's
brain!&mdash;'twas that his lip had touched. Still, as life ebbed from her
gangrenous coagulated wounds, her lacerated arms, like crushed vipers,
wound their torn muscles round his felon knee. With a glare
of fury he beheld the demon laughing o'er his prey, but, as the master
of these forfeit souls, spurned the already putrescent masses of still
conscious mortality into the turgid sable of that yawning gulf: their
life-rending shriek awaked the distant bandits, who had been deaf
to the phenomena of nature. What sight awaits them?</p>

<p class="indent">Now all the gods to speed! it is the Steam Beacon of the
Railroad, which begins to flare in token of their chieftain's victory:
and lo! he comes, bearing in one hand two papers;&mdash;the first, a free
pardon for himself and gallant band; the second, a restitution of his
Italian estates, as the rightful Count Cigaro. In his other hand he
leads the rescued Clotilde, followed by her venerable father Sir
Gunterzwartz; and if a momentary cloud o'ershadowed their spirits at the
memory of the dead, it was dissipated on the morrow at the altar of
Hymen, where the Druidic high-priest, assisted by his patriarchs,
conferred the blushing hand of Clotilde on the joy-o'erflowed eye of
her devoted Guzman; announcing to the assembled senate this moral
lesson,&mdash;that necromancy dislocates every vital tie; but that whene'er
irregular valour substitutes, in favour of injured beauty, the boudoir
of bliss for the dungeon of despair, there is in such exchange
no robbery."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">To this we can only add, that Miss St. Cloud
and a young gentleman we know might write a delightful book between them;
and that the sooner they form a literary partnership, the better.</p>

<h2>HANDY ANDY.&mdash;No. II.</h2>

<p class="indent">Andy walked out of the room with an air of supreme triumph,
having laid the letters on the table, and left the squire staring after him
in perfect amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, by the holy Paul! that's the most extraordinary genius
I ever came across," was the soliloquy the master uttered as the servant
closed the door after him; and the squire broke the seal of the
letter that Andy's blundering had so long delayed. It was from his
law-agent, on the subject of an expected election in the county which
would occur in case of the demise of the then-sitting member;&mdash;it
ran thus:</p>

<p class="author"><br />"Dublin, Thursday.</p>
<p class="blockquot indent"><span class="smcap">My dear squire.</span>&mdash;I am making
all possible exertions to have every and the earliest information on the subject of
the election. I say the election,&mdash;because, though the seat for the county is
not yet vacant, it is impossible but that it must soon be so. Any other man
than the present member must have died long ago; but Sir Timothy
Trimmer has been so undecided all his life that he cannot at present
make up his mind to die; and it is only by Death himself giving the
casting vote that the question can be decided. The writ for the vacant
county is expected to arrive by every mail, and in the mean time
I am on the alert for information. You know we are sure of the
barony of Ballysloughgutthery, and the boys of Killanmaul will murder
any one that dares to give a vote against you. We are sure of
Knockdoughty also, and the very pigs in Glanamuck would return
you; but I must put you on your guard in one point where you least
expected to be betrayed. You told me you were sure of Neck-or-nothing
Hall; but I can tell you you're out there; for the master of the
aforesaid is working heaven and earth to send us all to h&mdash;ll. He
backs the other interest; for he is so over head and ears in debt, that
he is looking out for a pension, and hopes to get one by giving his
interest to the Honourable Sackville Scatterbrain, who sits for the
borough of Old Gooseberry at present, but whose friends think his
talents are worthy of a county. If Sack wins, Neck-or-nothing gets a
pension,&mdash;that's <i>poz</i>. I had it from the best authority. I lodge
at a milliner's here:&mdash;no matter; more when I see you. But don't
be afraid; we'll bag Sack; and distance Neck-or-nothing. But,
seriously speaking, it's a d&mdash;d good joke that O'Grady should use you
in this manner, who have been so kind to him in money matters;
but, as the old song says, 'Poverty parts good company;' and he is
so cursed poor that he can't afford to know you any longer, now
that you have lent him all the money you had, and the pension <i>in
prospectu</i> is too much for his feelings. I'll be down with you again
as soon as I can, for I hate the diabolical town as I do poison. They
have altered Stephen's Green&mdash;<i>ruined</i> it, I should say. They have
taken away the big ditch that was round it, where I used to hunt
water-rats when a boy. They are destroying the place with their
d&mdash;d improvements. All the dogs are well, I hope, and my favorite
bitch. Remember me to Mrs. Egan, Whom all admire.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent space-above1">Murtough Murphy was a great character, as may be guessed from
his letter. He was a country attorney of good practice;&mdash;good, because
he could not help it,&mdash;for he was a clever, ready-witted fellow,
up to all sorts of trap, and one in whose hands a cause was
very safe; therefore he had plenty of clients without his seeking
them. For, if Murtough's practice had depended on his looking for
it, he might have made broth of his own parchment; for though,
to all intents and purposes, a good attorney, he was so full of fun
and fond of amusement, that it was only by dint of the business being
thrust upon him he was so extensive a practitioner. He loved
a good bottle, a good hunt, a good joke, and a good song, as well as
any fellow in Ireland; and even when he was obliged in the way
of business to press a gentleman hard,&mdash;to hunt his man to the
death,&mdash;he did it so good-humouredly that his very victim could
not be angry with him. As for those he served, he was their prime
favourite; there was nothing they <i>could</i> want to be done in the
parchment line that Murtough would not find out some way of doing;
and he was so pleasant a fellow, that he shared in the hospitality
of all the best tables in the county. He kept good horses, was on
every race-ground within twenty miles, and a steeple-chase was
no steeple-chase without him. Then he betted freely, and, what's
more, won his bets very generally; but no one found fault with
him for that, and he took your money with such a good grace, and
mostly gave you a <i>bon-mot</i> in exchange for it,&mdash;so that, next to
winning the money yourself, you were glad it was won by Murtough Murphy.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire read his letter two or three times, and made his
comments as he proceeded. "'Working heaven and earth to send us to&mdash;' So,
that's the work O'Grady's at&mdash;that's old friendship&mdash;d&mdash;d
unfair: and after all the money I lent him too;&mdash;he'd better take
care&mdash;I'll be down on him if he plays foul;&mdash;not that I'd like that
much either;&mdash;but&mdash;Let's see who's this is coming down to oppose
me?&mdash;Sack Scatterbrain&mdash;the biggest fool from this to himself;&mdash;the
fellow can't ride a bit,&mdash;a pretty member for a sporting county! 'I
lodge at a milliner's'&mdash;divil doubt you, Murtough; I'll engage you
do.&mdash;Bad luck to him!&mdash;he'd rather be fooling away his time in a
back-parlour, behind a bonnet-shop, than minding the interests of
the county. 'Pension'&mdash;ha!&mdash;wants it sure enough,&mdash;take care,
O'Grady, or by the powers I'll be at you.&mdash;You may baulk all the
bailiffs, and defy any other man to serve you with a writ; but, by
jingo! if I take the matter in hand, I'll be bound I'll get it done.
'Stephen's Green&mdash;big ditch&mdash;where I used to hunt water-rats.'&mdash;Divil
sweep you, Murphy! you'd rather be hunting water-rats any
day than minding your business.&mdash;He's a clever fellow for all that.
'Favourite bitch&mdash;Mrs. Egan.' Ay!&mdash;there's the end of it&mdash;with his
bit o' po'thry too! The divil!</p>

<p class="indent">The squire threw down the letter, and then his eye
caught the other two that Andy had purloined.</p>

<p class="indent">"More of that stupid blackguard's work!&mdash;robbing the
mail&mdash;no less!&mdash;that fellow will be hanged some time or other. 'Egad,
maybe they'll hang him for this! What's best to be done?&mdash;Maybe it will
be the safest way to see who they are for, and send them to the
parties, and request they will say nothing: that's it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The squire here took up the letters that lay before him,
to read their superscriptions; and the first he turned over was directed to
Gustavus Granby O'Grady, Esq. Neck-or-nothing Hall, Knockbotherum.
This was what is called a curious coincidence. Just as he
had been reading all about O'Grady's intended treachery to him,
here was a letter to that individual, and with the Dublin post-mark
too, and a very grand seal.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire examined the arms, and, though not versed in
the mysteries of heraldry, he thought he remembered enough of most of the
arms he had seen to say that this armorial bearing was a strange
one to him. He turned the letter over and over again, and looked
at it back and front, with an expression in his face that said, as plain
as countenance could speak, "I'd give a trifle to know what is inside
of this." He looked at the seal again: "Here's a&mdash;goose, I think it
is, sitting in a bowl, with cross-bars on it, and a spoon in its mouth:
like the fellow that owns it, maybe. A goose with a silver spoon in
his mouth! Well, here's the gable-end of a house, and a bird sitting
on the top of it. Could it be Sparrow? There's a fellow called
Sparrow that's under-secretary at the Castle. D&mdash;n it! I wish I
knew what it's about."</p>

<p class="indent">The squire threw down the letter as he said "d&mdash;n it,"
but took it up again in a few seconds, and, catching it edgewise between his
fore-finger and thumb, gave a gentle pressure that made the letter
gape at its extremities; and the squire, exercising that sidelong
glance which is peculiar to postmasters, waiting-maids, and magpies
who inspect marrow-bones, peeped into the interior of the epistle,
saying to himself as he did so, "All's fair in war, and why not in
electioneering?" His face, which was screwed up to the scrutinizing
pucker, gradually lengthened as he caught some words that
were on the last turn-over of the sheet, and so could be read thoroughly,
and his brow darkened into the deepest frown as he scanned
these lines: "As you very properly and pungently remark, poor
Egan is a <i>bladder</i>&mdash;a mere <i>bladder</i>." "I am a <i>bladdher</i>?
by Jasus!" said the squire, tearing the letter into pieces and throwing it
into the fire. "And so, <i>Misther</i> O'Grady, you say I'm a bladdher!"
and the blood of the Egans rose as the head of that pugnacious family
strided up and down the room: "I'll bladdher you, my buck,&mdash;I'll
settle your hash!"</p>

<p class="indent">Here he took up the poker, and made a very angry lunge at
the fire, that did not want stirring, and there he beheld the letter blazing
merrily away. He dropped the poker as if he had caught it by the
hot end, as he exclaimed, "What the d&mdash;l shall I do? I've burnt
the letter!" This threw the squire into a fit of what he was wont to
call his "considering cap;" and he sat with his feet on the fender
for some minutes, occasionally muttering to himself what he began
with,&mdash;"What the d&mdash;l shall I do? It's all owing to that infernal
Andy&mdash;I'll murder that fellow some time or other. If he hadn't
brought it, I shouldn't have seen it&mdash;to be sure, if I hadn't looked;
but then the temptation&mdash;a saint couldn't have withstood it. Confound
it! what a stupid trick to burn it. Another here, too&mdash;must
burn that as well, and say nothing about either of them;" and
he took up the second letter, and, merely looking at the address,
threw it into the fire. He then rang the bell, and desired Andy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
to be sent to him. As soon as that ingenious individual made
his appearance, the squire desired him with peculiar emphasis to
shut the door, and then opened upon him with,</p>

<p class="indent">"You unfortunate rascal!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yis, your honour."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you know that you might be hanged for what you did to-day?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What did I do, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You robbed the post-office."</p>

<p class="indent">"How did I rob it, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You took two letters you had no right to."</p>

<p class="indent">"It's no robbery for a man to get the worth of his money."</p>

<p class="indent">"Will you hold your tongue, you stupid villain! I'm not joking:
you absolutely might be hanged for robbing the post-office."</p>

<p class="indent">"Sure I didn't know there was any harm in what I done; and
for that matther, sure, if they're sitch wondherful value, can't I go back
again wid 'em?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, you thief! I hope you have not said a word
to any one about it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not the sign of a word passed my lips about it."</p>

<p class="indent">"You're sure?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sartin."</p>

<p class="indent">"Take care, then, that you never open your mouth to mortal
about it, or you'll be hanged, as sure as your name is Andy Rooney."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, at that rate I never will. But maybe your honour
thinks I ought to be hanged?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No,&mdash;because you did not intend to do a wrong thing;
but, only I have pity on you, I could hang you to-morrow for what you've
done."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"I've burnt the letters, so no one can know anything about the
business unless you tell on yourself: so remember,&mdash;not a word."</p>

<p class="indent">"Faith. I'll be as dumb as the dumb baste."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go, now; and, once for all, remember you'll be hanged so sure
as you ever mention one word about this affair."</p>

<p class="indent">Andy made a bow and a scrape, and left the squire,
who hoped the secret was safe. He then took a ruminating walk round the
pleasure-grounds, revolving plans of retaliation upon his false friend
O'Grady; and having determined to put the most severe and sudden
measure of the law in force against him for the monies in which he
was indebted to him, he only awaited the arrival of Murtough Murphy
from Dublin to execute his vengeance. Having settled this in
his own mind, he became more contented, and said, with a self-satisfied
nod of the head, "We'll see who's the <i>bladdher</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">In a few days Murtough Murphy returned from Dublin,
and to Merryvale he immediately proceeded. The squire opened to him
directly his intention of commencing hostile law proceedings against
O'Grady, and asked what most summary measures could be put in
practice against him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! various, various, my dear squire," said Murphy; "but I
don't see any great use in doing so <i>yet</i>,&mdash;he has not openly avowed
himself."</p>

<p class="indent">"But does he not intend to coalesce with the other party?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I believe so;&mdash;that is, if he's to get the pension."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Well, and that's as good as done, you know; for if they want
him, the pension is easily managed."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm not so sure of that."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, they're as plenty as blackberries."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very true; but, you see, Lord Gobblestown swallows all
the pensions for his own family; and there are a great many complaints in
the market against him for plucking that blackberry-bush very bare
indeed; and unless Sack Scatterbrain has swingeing interest, the pension
may not be such an easy thing."</p>

<p class="indent">"But still O'Grady has shown himself not my friend."</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear squire, don't be so hot: he has not <i>shown</i>
himself yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, but he means it."</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear squire, you oughtn't to jump a conclusion like
a twelve-foot drain or a five-bar gate."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, he's a blackguard."</p>

<p class="indent">"No denying it; and therefore keep him on your side, if you
can, or he'll be a troublesome customer on the other."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll keep no terms with him;&mdash;I'll slap at him directly.
What can you do that's wickedest?&mdash;latitat, capias&mdash;fee-faw-fum,
or whatever you call it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hollo! squire, you're overrunning your game: maybe, after all,
he <i>won't</i> join the Scatterbrains, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I tell you it's no matter; he intended doing it, and that's
all the same. I'll slap at him,&mdash;I'll blister him!"</p>

<p class="indent">Murtough Murphy wondered at this blind fury of the squire,
who, being a good-humoured and good-natured fellow in general, puzzled
the attorney the more by his present manifest malignity against
O'Grady. But he had not seen the turn-over of the letter: he had
not seen "<i>bladdher</i>,"&mdash;the real and secret cause of the "war to
the knife" spirit which was kindled in the squire's breast.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course you can do what you please; but, if you'd
take a friend's advice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I tell you I'll blister him."</p>

<p class="indent">"He certainly <i>bled</i> you very freely."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll blister him, I tell you, and that smart. Lose no time,
Murphy, my boy: let loose the dogs of law on him, and harass him till
he'd wish the d&mdash;l had him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Just as you like; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll have it my own way, I tell you; so say no more."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll commence against him at once then, as you wish it; but it's
no use, for you know very well that it will be impossible to serve him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Let me alone for that: I'll be bound I'll find fellows to
get the inside of him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, his house is barricaded like a jail, and he has dogs
enough to bait all the bulls in the country."</p>

<p class="indent">"No matter; just send me the blister for him, and I'll
engage I'll stick it on him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well, squire; you shall have the blister as soon as
it can be got ready. I'll tell you whenever you may send over to me for it,
and your messenger shall have it hot and warm for him. Good-b'ye,
squire."</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-b'ye, Murphy!&mdash;lose no time."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"In the twinkling of a bed-post. Are you going to Tom Durfy's
steeple-chase?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm not sure."</p>

<p class="indent">"I've a bet on it. Did you see the Widow Flanagan lately?
You didn'? They say Tom's pushing it strong there. The widow has
money, you know, and Tom does it all for the love o' God; for you
know, squire, there are two things God hates,&mdash;a coward and a poor
man. Now, Tom's no coward; and, that he may be sure of the love
o' God on the other score, he's making up to the widow; and, as he's
a slashing fellow, she's nothing loth, and, for fear of any one cutting
him out, Tom keeps as sharp a look-out after her as she does after
him. He's fierce on it, and looks pistols at any one that attempts
putting his <i>comether</i> on the widow, while she looks "as soon as you
plaze," as plain as an optical lecture can enlighten the heart of man:
in short, Tom's all ram's horns, and the widow all sheep's eyes.
Good-b'ye, squire!" And Murtough put spurs to his horse and cantered
down the avenue, singing.</p>

<p class="indent">Andy was sent over to Murtough Murphy's for the law process
at the appointed time; and, as he had to pass through the village, Mrs.
Egan desired him to call at the apothecary's for some medicine
that was prescribed for one of the children.</p>

<p class="indent">"What'll I ax for, ma'am?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'd be sorry to trust to you, Andy, for remembering.
Here's the prescription; take great care of it, and Mr. M'Grane will give
you something to bring back; and mind, if it's a powder, don't let
it get wet as you did the sugar the other day."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, ma'am."</p>

<p class="indent">"And if it's a bottle, don't break it as you did the last."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, ma'am."</p>

<p class="indent">"And make haste."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yis, ma'am:" and off went Andy.</p>

<p class="indent">In going through the village he forgot to leave the
prescription at the apothecary's, and pushed on for the attorney's: there
he saw Murtough Murphy, who handed him the law process, enclosed
in a cover, with a note to the squire.</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you been doing anything very clever lately,
Andy?" said Murtough.</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't know, sir," said Andy.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you shoot any one with soda-water since I saw you last?"</p>

<p class="indent">Andy grinned.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you kill any more dogs lately, Andy?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Faith, you're too hard on me, sir: sure
I never killed but one dog, and that was an accident&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"An accident!&mdash;D&mdash;n your impudence, you thief!
Do you think, if you killed one of the pack on purpose, we wouldn't cut the
very heart out o' you with our hunting-whips?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Faith, I wouldn't doubt you, sir: but, sure, how could I help
that divil of a mare runnin' away wid me, and thramplin' the dogs?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why didn't you hold her, you thief?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hould her, indeed!&mdash;you just might as well expect
to stop fire among flax as that one."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, be off with you now, Andy, and take care of what
I gave you for the squire."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, never fear, sir," said Andy, as he turned his horse's
head homeward. He stopped at the apothecary's in the village to execute
his commission for "misthis." On telling the son of Galen that
he wanted some physic "for one o' the childre up at the big house,"
the dispenser of the healing art asked <i>what</i> physic he wanted.</p>

<p class="indent">"Faith, I dunna what physic."</p>

<p class="indent">"What's the matter with the child?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He's sick, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose so, indeed, or you wouldn't be sent for
medicine.&mdash;You're always making some blunder. You come here, and
don't know what description of medicine is wanted."</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't I?" said Andy with a great air.</p>

<p class="indent">"No you don't, you omadhaun!" said the apothecary.</p>

<p class="indent">Andy fumbled in his pockets and could not lay hold of the
paper his mistress entrusted him with until he had emptied them thoroughly
of their contents upon the counter of the shop; and then taking the
prescription from the collection, he said, "So you tell me I don't
know the description of the physic I'm to get. Now, you see you're
out; for <i>that's</i> the <i>description</i>." And he slapped the
counter impressively with his hand, as he threw down the recipe
before the apothecary.</p>

<p class="indent">While the medicine was in the course of preparation for
Andy, he commenced restoring to his pockets the various parcels he had
taken from them in hunting for the recipe, Now, it happened that
he had laid them down close beside some articles that were compounded,
and sealed up for going out, on the apothecary's counter; and
as the law process which Andy had received from Murtough Murphy
chanced to resemble in form another enclosure that lay beside it,
containing a blister, Andy, under the influence of his peculiar genius,
popped the blister into his pocket instead of the packet which had
been confided to him by the attorney, and having obtained the necessary
medicine from M'Grane, rode home with great self-complacency
that he had not forgot to do a single thing that had been entrusted
to him: "I'm all right this time," said Andy to himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Scarcely had he left the apothecary's shop when
another messenger alighted at its door, and asked "If Squire O'Grady's
things was ready?"</p>

<p class="indent">"There they are," said the innocent M'Grane, pointing to the
bottles, boxes, and <i>blister</i>, he had made up and set aside, little dreaming
that the blister had been exchanged for a law process; and Squire
O'Grady's own messenger popped into his pocket the legal instrument,
that it was as much as any seven men's lives were worth to bring
within gun-shot of Neck-or-nothing Hall.</p>

<p class="indent">Home he went, and the sound of the old gate creaking on its
hinges at the entrance to the avenue awoke the deep-mouthed dogs around
the house, who rushed infuriate to the spot to devour the unholy
intruder on the peace and privacy of the patrician O'Grady; but they
recognised the old grey hack and his rider, and quietly wagged their
tails and trotted back, and licked their lips at the thoughts of the
bailiff they had hoped to eat.
The door of Neck-or-nothing Hall was carefully unbarred and unchained,
and the nurse-tender was handed the parcel from the apothecary, and
re-ascended to the sick-room with slippered foot as quietly as
she could; for the renowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
O'Grady was, according to her account, "as cross as two sticks;"
and she protested, furthermore, "that her heart was grey with him."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. O'Grady was near the bed of the sick man as
the nurse-tender entered.</p>

<p class="indent">"Here's the things for your honour now," said she in
her most soothing tone.</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish the d&mdash;l had you and them!" said O'Grady.</p>

<p class="indent">"Gusty, dear!" said his wife. She might have said stormy
instead of gusty.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! they'll do you good, your honour," said the nurse-tender,
curtsying, and uncorking bottles, and opening a pill-box.</p>

<p class="indent">"Curse them all!" said the squire. "A pretty thing to have
a gentleman's body made a perfect sink for these blackguard doctors
and apothecaries to pour their dirty stuff into&mdash;faugh!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, sir, dear, there's a little blisther just to go
on your chest&mdash;if you plaze&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"A <i>what</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">"A warm plasther, dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"A <i>blister</i> you said, you old <i>divil</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, sure, it's something to relieve you."</p>

<p class="indent">The squire gave a deep growl, and his wife put in
the usual appeal of "Gusty, dear!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hold your tongue, will you? how would <i>you</i> like it?
I wish you had it on your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"'Deed-an-deed, dear,&mdash;" said the nurse-tender.</p>

<p class="indent">"By the 'ternal war! if you say another word,
I'll throw the jug at you!"</p>

<p class="indent">"And there's a nice dhrop o' gruel I have on the fire for you,"
said the nurse, pretending not to mind the rising anger of the squire,
as she stirred the gruel with one hand, while with the other she
marked herself with the sign of the cross, and said in a mumbling
manner, "God presarve us! he's the most cantankerous Christian I
ever kem across!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Show me that infernal thing!" said the squire.</p>

<p class="indent">"What thing, dear?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You know well enough, you old hag!&mdash;that blackguard blister!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Here it is, dear. Now, just open the brust o' your shirt,
and let me put it an you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Give it into my hand here, and let me see it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Sartinly, sir;&mdash;but I think, if you'd let me just&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Give it to me, I tell you!" said the squire, in a tone so
fierce that the nurse paused in her unfolding of the packet, and handed it with
fear and trembling to the already indignant O'Grady. But it is only
imagination can figure the outrageous fury of the squire, when, on
opening the envelope with his own hand, he beheld the law process
before him. There, in the heart of his castle, with his bars, and bolts,
and bull-dogs, and blunderbusses round him, he was served&mdash;absolutely
served,&mdash;and he had no doubt the nurse-tender was bribed to
betray him.</p>

<p class="indent">A roar and a jump up in bed, first startled his wife
into terror, and put the nurse on the defensive.</p>

<p class="indent">"You infernal old strap!" shouted he, as he clutched up
a handful of bottles on the table near him and flung them at the nurse, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
was near the fire at the time; and she whipped the pot of gruel from
the grate, and converted it into a means of defence against the
phial-pelting storm.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. O'Grady rolled herself up in the bed-curtains,
while the nurse screeched "murther!" and at last, when O'Grady saw that
bottles were of no avail, he scrambled out of bed, shouting, "Where's
my blunderbuss?" and the nurse-tender, while he endeavoured to get
it down from the rack, where it was suspended over the mantelpiece,
bolted out of the door, which she locked on the outside, and
ran to the most remote corner of the house for shelter.</p>

<p class="indent">In the mean time, how fared it at Merryvale? Andy returned
with his parcel for the squire, and his note from Murtough Murphy, which ran thus:</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">
"<span class="smcap">My dear squire.</span>&mdash;I send you the <i>blister</i> for O'Grady,
as you insist on it; but I think you won't find it easy to serve him with it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">"Your obedient and obliged,</span>
<span class="i36">"<span class="smcap">Murtough Murphy</span>."</span>
<span class="i0">"<i>To Edward Egan, Esq. Merryvale.</i>"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent space-below1">The squire opened the cover, and when he saw a
real instead of a figurative blister, grew crimson with rage. He could not
speak for some minutes, his indignation was so excessive. "So!" said he, at
last, "Mr. Murtough Murphy&mdash;you think to cut your jokes with me,
do you? By all that's sacred! I'll cut such a joke on you with the
biggest horsewhip I can find, that you'll remember it. '<i>Dear squire,
I send you the blister.</i>' Bad luck to your impidence! Wait till awhile
ago&mdash;that's all. By this and that, you'll get such a blistering from
me that all the spermaceti in M'Grane's shop won't cure you."</p>

<h2>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF RICHARDSON, THE SHOWMAN.</h2>
<p class="f110"><i>With a Peep at Bartholomew Fair.</i></p>
<p class="f90">BY THE AUTHOR OF FISHER'S NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY.</p>
<p class="f110 space-below1"><i>Seventeenth Edition, 4to.</i></p>

<p class="indent">In a periodical like the present, a contributor, if he really have
anything in him, ought to set off at score. Such is my determination.</p>

<p class="indent">Works of the sort can only be produced by the exhibition of
three rare qualities, namely, Wit, Humour, and entertaining Fiction. The
first has been compared to a razor, which "cuts the most when
exquisitely keen;" the second I will venture to liken to a table-knife,
which slashes away at all on the board, and the best when broadly
shining and tolerably sharp in the edge; and the last is familiar
enough to everybody, under the term of "throwing the hatchet." But
whatever the instrument, be it razor, or knife, or axe, it is quite
essential that it should never lose its temper.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mais l'audace est commune, et le bon sens est rare;</span>
<span class="i0">Au lieu d'être piquant, souvent on est bizarre:</span>
</div></div>

<p>which, being freely translated, means,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In life there's so much impudence,</span>
<span class="i0">And very little common sense,</span>
<span class="i0">That writers trying to be witty,</span>
<span class="i0">Are only foolish: more's the pity!</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">"The Showman,"&mdash;for so was this eminent individual
designated by the world at large, and so upon memorable occasions he called
himself;&mdash;was, it will be felt, a title of high distinction. When we
look around us, and see how many men are playing showmen, and
how miserably they succeed, we shall at once be convinced that nothing
but very superior merit could have won for Richardson the glory
of the definite "the." <i>He</i> was not showing off himself, but others:
he was nor showing off his own follies, but the follies of society. Thus,
instead of being a laughing-stock, he laughed in his own sleeve; and
by keeping a fool, instead of making a fool of himself, he eschewed
poverty, and ultimately died in the odour and sanctity of wealth.</p>

<p class="indent">Richardson originated at <i>Great</i> Marlow, in the county
of Bucks; the very name of the place seeming to intimate that he was born to
achieve greatness. Whether he was lineally descended from the author
of Clarissa Harlowe is, and will long continue to be, a disputed
fact. There was a family resemblance between them; both were
country gentlemen, and both wore top-boots.</p>

<p class="indent">For breeding, Mr. Richardson was indebted to the parish
workhouse,&mdash;fair promise of his future industry. In those days the poor
laws had not been amended; and children, being victualled satisfactorily,
generally throve accordingly. Under correction be it spoken,
workhouses in country towns were then far from being houses of
correction. So our hero grew up.</p>

<p class="indent">When big enough, he acquitted himself with reputation in the
employment of out o' door activity; for he never resembled the lazy fellow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
reduced by idleness to want, who said in excuse, "When they
bid me go to the ant to learn wisdom, I am almost always going to
my uncle's."</p>

<p class="indent">From Marlow, after due probation, young Richardson, it is
stated, sought his fortune in the metropolis, and entered into the service of
Mr. Rhodes, a huge cow-keeper&mdash;a colossus in the milky way. Here
it is probable he acquired a taste for pastorals, and that extraordinary
proficiency in the Welsh language which rendered his dialogue in
after-times so strikingly rich and Celto-Doric. Some etymologists
thence infer that it was <i>Pick't</i>; but we don't believe it.</p>

<p class="indent">We never read the life of an actor or actress without being
told, about the period of Richardson's career at which we have now arrived,
that the "ruling passion" took such strong possession of them, that
they must break all bounds, run away, and join some strolling company,
to "imp their wings," or some flight of that sort. So it happened
with our hero: he cut the cows, and hastened to adhere to Mrs.
Penley, then performing with unprecedented success in a club-room
at Shadwell, a small town in the vicinity of Wapping. The houses
were crowded; receipts to the full amount of five shillings nightly
crowned their efforts, and the corps, consisting of two gentlemen and
two ladies, divided the five among four, playing as it were all fours in
a fives court. Encouraged by this success, Richardson resolved to
extend his fame, and accordingly visited many parts of the provinces,
starring it from the Shadwell boards. Mighty as must have been his
deserts, he met with no Bath manager, no Tate Wilkinson, no Macready
or Kemble, to appreciate his histrionic talents. One night,
having accidentally witnessed a representation of the School for Scandal,
he fancied he could play the little broker; so he returned to
London, and took a small shop in that line of business. About the
year ninety-six, he was enabled to rent the Harlequin, a public-house
near the stage-door of old Drury, and much frequented by dramatic
wights. It was of one of these that Richardson used to tell his most
elaborate pun. Being asked if he did anything in the dramatic line,
he answered, "I do more or less in it in every way: I do what I can in
the first syllable, <i>dram</i>, and in the first two syllables,
<i>drama</i>; in the last two syllables, <i>attic</i>, I am to be seen
every night; and in the last, <i>tick</i>&mdash;m' eye!
I wish you knew my exertions."</p>

<p class="indent">It was not to be expected that the Harlequin could last
long without a change; for not only was the sign contrariwise thereto, but the
place itself was a change-house. Our landlord therefore let it; and
crying "Damned be he that lets me!" bought a caravan, engaged a
company from among his customers, and opened his first booth at
Bartholomew Fair. But the name of this famed annual assemblage&mdash;now,
alas! in a deep decline&mdash;is enough to tempt a scribbler for hire
to branch off into an episode. And here it is.</p>

<p class="indent">Proclaimed on the 3rd of September, to last during three
lawful days, exclusive of the day of proclamation, "Bartholomew Faire," as
appears from a pamphlet under that title, printed for Richard Harper,
at the Bible and Harpe, in Smithfield, A. D. 1641, began on the 24th
of August, old style. About the year 1102, in the reign of Henry
the First, Rahere, a minstrel of the king, founded the priory, hospital,
and church of St. Bartholomew, in Smithfield, as requested by the
saint himself in a dream, and, it is presumed, upon a bed where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
dreamer could guess what it was to be flea'd alive. Rahere was the
first prior, and in his time there was a grand row with Boniface,
Archbishop of Canterbury, on a visitation, when sundry skulls of canons,
monks, and friars were cracked, which probably suggested that the
site would be very eligible for an annual fair. Henry the Second
accordingly granted that privilege to the clothiers of England and the
drapers of <i>London</i>; and his charter to the mayor and aldermen is
extant to this day. Theretofore called "The Elms," from the
noble trees which adorned it, Smithfield became in turn a place for
splendid jousts, tournaments, pageants, and feats of chivalry; a market
for cattle and hay; a scene of cruel executions; and one where, as old
Stow acquaints us, loose serving-men and quarrelsome persons resorted
and made uproars, thus becoming the rendezvous of bullies and
bravoes, till it earned the appropriate name of "Ruffians' Hall." King
Solomon, <i>alias</i> Jacobus Primus, caused it to be paved two hundred
and twenty years agone, which we have on the authority of Master
Arthur Strange-ways, whose statement leads us to infer that the Lord
Mayor of 1614 had never opened a railroad, like Lord Mayor Kelly
in 1886. Then and there our ancient civic magnates were wont to
disport themselves with witnessing "wrastlings," shooting the broad
arrow and flights for games, and hunting real wild rabbits by the
city boys, with great noise and laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">Posterior to the priors, and superior to the sub-priors of
St. Bartholomew, the canons have been succeeded by common guns; and the
friars by fried pigs, the most renowned viand of the festival;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
the monks have given place to monkeys, and the recluses to showmen.
Such are the mute abilities of Father Time. "The severall enormityes
and misdemeanours, which are there seene and acted," are they
not upon record? "Hither resort (says Master Harper, 1641) people
of all sorts, high and low, rich and poore, from cities, townes, and
countrys; of all sects, Papists, Atheists, Anabaptists, and Brownists;
and of all conditions, knaves and fooles, cuckolds and cuckoldmakers,
pimpes and panders, rogues and rascalls, the little loud-one and the
witty wanton. The faire is full of gold and silver drawers: just as
Lent is to the fishmonger, so is Bartholomew Faire to the pick-pocket.
It is his high harvest, which is never bad but when his cart goes up
Holborne. Some of your cut-purses are in fee with cheating costermongers.
They have many dainty baits to draw a bit; fine fowlers
they are, for every finger of theirs is a lime-twigge with which they
catch dotterels. They are excellently well read in physiognomy, for
they will know how strong you are in the purse by looking in your
face; and, for the more certainty thereof, they will follow you close,
and never leave you till you draw your purse, or they for you, though
they kisse Newgate for it."</p>

<p class="indent">Hone, in his Every-day Book (Part X.), furnished an excellent
view of this fair, full of curious dramatic and other matter. He describes
the shows of 1825, among which, <i>àpropos</i>, Richardson's theatre figures
prominently. The outside, he tells us, was above thirty feet in height,
and occupied one platform one hundred feet in width. The platform
was very elevated, the back of it lined with green baize, and festooned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
with deeply-fringed crimson curtains, except at two places where the
money-takers sat, in roomy projections fitted up like Gothic shrinework,
with columns and pinnacles. There were fifteen-hundred
variegated illumination-lamps, in chandeliers, lustres, wreaths, and
festoons. A band of ten musicians in scarlet dresses, similar to
those worn by his Majesty's Beefeaters, continually played on various
instruments; while the performers paraded in their gayest "properties"
before the gazing multitude. Audiences rapidly ascended on
each performance being over; and, paying their money to the receivers
in their Gothic seats, had tickets in return, which, being taken at the
doors, admitted them to descend into the "theatre." The performances
were the Wandering Outlaw, a melodrama, with the death of
the villain and appearance of the accusing spirit;&mdash;a comic harlequinade,
Harlequin Faustus;&mdash;and concluding with a splendid panorama,
painted by the first artists.&mdash;Boxes, two shillings; pit, one shilling;
and gallery, sixpence.</p>

<p class="indent">The theatre held nearly a thousand people, continually emptying
and filling, and the performances were got over in about a quarter of
an hour! And, though anticipating a little of our personal narrative,
we may as well mention here, that occasionally, when the outside platform
was crowded with impatient spectators waiting for their turn to
be admitted, though the performances had not lasted more than five
minutes, Mr. Richardson would send in to inquire if <i>John Over-y</i> was
there, which was the well-known signal to finish off-hand, strike the
gong, turn out the one audience, and turn in their successors, to see
as much of the Outlaw, the Devil, or Dr. Faustus, as time permitted.</p>

<p class="indent">Ben Johnson's play of Bartholomew Fair in 1614 explains
many of its ancient humours, and particularly the eating of Bartholomew pig,
already noticed, and not to be repeated, as we desire to pen something
more to the purpose in Smithfield than a dry antiquarian essay,
though it relate to hares playing on the tabor, or tigers taught to
pluck chickens. In the latter way a ballad of 1655 may suffice.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1715 the largest booth ever erected was in the centre of
Smithfield, "for the King's Players;" and, in later times, we read of Garrick
going to see the pieces at Yates' and Shuter's booth. Hogarth
in his youth painted scenes for a famous woman who kept a droll in
the fair; and the old lady refused to pay because Dutch metal was
used instead of real gilding with leaf-gold. Pidcock and Polito exhibited
their finest animals; Astley his troop of horse, succeeded by
Saunders. Puppet-shows, or motions, as they were called, were also
always popular here; and giants, dwarfs, and whatever was singular
in nature, or could be made to seem so by art, have from time immemorial
been the wonders and favourites of Bartholomew Fair.</p>

<p class="indent">Having now brought "<i>the</i> Showman" to the management of
what he might have designated the National Theatre, with the long-established
Jonases, Penleys, Jobsons, <i>et hoc genus omne</i> as his rivals,&mdash;the
commencement of a career of half a century's duration,&mdash;may we
not pause to point towards him the finger of admiration? What are
the lessees of Drury Lane or Covent Garden when compared to him?
What have they done, or what are they likely to do, for the legitimate
drama, when compared to him? He was a manager who paid
his performers weekly on the nail; meaning by "the nail" the drum-head.
On the Saturday evening, assembling them all, willing and
buoyant, around him, he spread the sum total of their salaries upon
the drum,&mdash;not double base, like the frauds of modern managers,&mdash;and
then there was a roll-call of the most agreeable description. Sometimes
the merry vagabonds would shove one another up against their
paymaster; but the worst of his resentment was to detect the <i>larker</i>,
if he could, and pay him last; or, if sorely annoyed, forget to invite
him to the following supper: punishments severe, it must be acknowledged;
but still the sufferers had their money to comfort themselves
withal, and were not obliged to wait, like the waits in the streets at
midnight, till after Christmas for the chance of their hard-earned
wages. And he was grateful, too. When marked success attended
any performer or performance, a marked requital was sure to follow.
The Spotted Boy was a fortune to him, though not all so black as
Jim Crow; and his affection grew with his growth. His portrait
adorned the Tusculum of the Showman; and, after his death, he
could not withdraw the green silk curtain from it without shedding
tears. Had that boy lived to be a man, there is no doubt but
Richardson would have made him independent of all the dark specks
on life's horizon. As it was, he was treated as by a father like a
spotless boy, and buried in the catacombs of the race of Richardson.</p>

<p class="indent">Next to the Spotted Boy, the performer whom Richardson
most boasted of having belonged to his company was Edmund Kean. He,
with Mrs. Carey, <i>quasi</i> mamma, and Henry, <i>quasi</i> brother,
were engaged by our spirited manager; and Kean, over his cups, used to
brag of having, by tumbling in front of the booth, tumbled hundreds
of bumpkins in to the spectacles within. He did Tom Thumb as tiny
Booth does now at the St. James's Theatre; and at a later period,
viz. 1806, is stated to have played Norval, and Motley in the Castle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Spectre, for him at Battersea fair. Another story adds, that he was
called on to recite his Tom-Thumbery before George the Third at
Windsor; but we will not vouch for the truth of the newspaper anecdote.</p>

<p class="indent">From the metropolitan glory of Bartholomew Fair, the
transition to the principal fairs of the kingdom was obvious. Mr. Richardson
went the whole hog, and, in so doing, had nearly gone to the dogs.
At that revolutionary period, neither the fairs nor the affairs of the
country were in a wholesome condition. Politics are ever adverse to
amusements. Vain was the attempt to beguile the snobbery of their
pence; and our poor caravan, like one in the deserts of the Stony
Araby, toiled on their weary march with full hearts and empty stomachs.
At length it is told, at Cambridge Fair,&mdash;well might it be
called by its less euphonous name of Stirbitch, so badly did the
speculation pay,&mdash;that Richardson and his clown, Tom Jefferies, of
facetious memory, were compelled to take a sort of French leave for
London, leaving much of their <i>materiel</i> in pawn. Undamped by
adversity, they took a fiddler with them; and the merry trio so
enamoured the dwellers and wayfarers upon the road, that they not only
extracted plentiful supplies for themselves, but were enabled to provide
sufficiently for the bodily wants of the main body of the company,
who followed at a judicious and respectable distance.</p>

<p class="indent">The pressure from without was, however, luckily but of
temporary endurance; and Richardson was soon well to do again in the world.
Fair succeeded fair, and he succeeded with all. His enterprise was
great, and his gains commensurate. He rose by degrees, and at
length became the most renowned of dramatic caterers for those
classes who are prone to enjoy the unadulterated drama. Why, his
mere outside by-play was worth fifty times more than the inside of
large houses, to witness such trash as has lately usurped the stage,
and pushed Tragedy from her throne, and Comedy from her stool. Of
these memorabilia we can call to mind only a few instances; but they
speak volumes for the powers of entertaining possessed by our hero.</p>

<p class="indent">It was at Peckham one day,&mdash;and a day of rain and
mud,&mdash;when Richardson, stepping from the steps of his booth, as Moncey,
the king of the beggars, was shovelling past on <i>his boards</i>, happened
to slip and fall. We shall not readily forget the good-humour with which
he looked, not up, but level, upon his companion, and sweetly said,
"'Faith! friend, it seems that neither you nor I can keep our feet."</p>

<p class="indent">At Brook Green, as the fair and happy were crushing up
to the pay-door, a pretty servant-girl was among the number. "I should
like to <i>hire</i> that girl," said a dandy to his comrade. "I rather guess
you would like to <i>lower</i> her," whispered Mr. R. in his ear. But she
was a good lass, and not at all like the French gentleman's maid, to
whom her master uttered these humiliating words: "Bah! you arre
a verry bad girl, and I shall make you <i>no</i> better."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. R. misliked drunkenness in his troop. "A fellow," he
exclaimed to one he was rating for this vice,&mdash;"a fellow who gets tipsy
every night will never be <i>a rising man</i> in any profession."</p>

<p class="indent">In a remote village some accident had destroyed a grotto
necessary to the representation of the piece entitled "The Nymphs of the
Grotto." What was to be done? There was no machinist within a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
hundred miles! "Is there not an <i>undertaker</i>?" exclaimed Mr. R.:
"he could surely execute a little shell-work!"</p>

<p class="indent">In an adjoining booth at Camberwell was exhibited a very old
man, whom the placards declared to have reached <i>a hundred and five
years of age</i>. "Here is a pretty thing to make a show of," observed
R. "A wonder, indeed! Why, if my grandfather had not died, he
would have been <i>a hundred and twenty</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">But why should we dwell on his facetiæ? Only to point the
poignant grief which tells us we shall never hear them more,&mdash;shall never
look upon his like again! Yes: let others mourn their Prichards,
their Garricks, their Kembles, and their Keans;&mdash;our <i>keen</i> is for
thee, John Richardson, the undisputed head of thy profession, the
master-spirit of them all, the glory of the mighty multitude,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">"Where thou wert fairest of the <i>Fair</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">And how liberal thou wert! Thou wert not a manager to debar
from their just privileges thy dramatic brethren, or insult the literary
characters who honourably patronised thy honourable endeavours.
Thy "Walk up!" was open and generous. When Jack Reeve
and a party from the Adelphi visited the splendid booth at Bartholomew
Fair, the veteran recognised his brethren of the buskin, and
immediately returned to them the money they had paid on entrance,
disdaining to pocket the hard-earned fruits of the stage. "You, or
any other actor of talent," said the old man, "are quite welcome to
visit my theatre free of expense." "No, no," replied Reeve, "keep
it, or (noticing a dissenting shake of the head) give it to the poor."
"If I have made a mistake," retorted John, "and have not done so
<i>already</i>, give it to them yourself; I will have nothing to do with it,
and I am not going to turn parish overseer."</p>

<p class="indent">At length, alas! his days&mdash;his fair days&mdash;were
numbered, and, as the song says, "the good old man must die." As his first,
so was his last exhibition at Smithfield; but Smithfield, like the other
national theatres, shorn of its splendour, degenerate, and degraded. It
seemed as if the last of the fairs: others had been abolished and put
down; and this, the topmost of them all, was sinking under the march
of intellect, the diffusion of knowledge, and the confusion of reform.
Fairs in Britain were ended, and it was not worth Richardson's while
to live any longer. He retired, tired and dejected, to his "Woodland
Cottage" in Horsemonger-lane; and on the morning of the 14th
of November was expected by the Angel of Death. His finale was
serene: his life had been strange and varied, but industrious and
frugal. The last time we saw him,&mdash;and it was to engage him on his
last loyal and public patriotic work, namely, to erect the scaffolding for
the inauguration of the statue of George III. in Cockspur-street,&mdash;he
approached us with a fine cabbage under his arm, which he had been
purchasing for dinner. His manners, too, were equally simple and
unaffected;&mdash;he was the Cincinnatus of his order. He told us of
the satisfaction he had given to George IV. by transporting the
giraffe in a beautiful caravan to Windsor Park. The caravan was
Richardson's world; and he might well have applied to that vehicle
the eastern apologue, "the place which changes its occupants so
often is not a palace, but a 'caravan'-serai." But we are giving way
to sorrow, though "away with melancholy" is our motto. A wide-mouthed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
musician&mdash;we forget whether clarionet or trombone&mdash;applied
to Richardson at Easter for an engagement at Greenwich fair: "You
won't do any thing till Christmas," said he: "you must wait, as you
are only fit for a Wait: you are one to play from ear to ear."</p>

<p class="indent">It is said that Richardson died rich; and indeed the sale
of his effects by auction showed that if other persons were men of property,
he was a man of properties. Three hundred and thirty-four lots of
multitudinous composition were submitted to the hammer; and it
was truly a jubilee to see how the Jews did outbid each other. There
were Nathan, and Hart, and Clarke, and Levy, besides an inferior
and dirtier lot, who got velvets, and silks, and satins, for the old
song, "Old Clo'!" Though their late owner, in the heyday of his prime,
observed, "I have to show my dresses by daylight, and they must be
first-rate; anything will do for the large theatres in the night-time,
either green-baize, or tin, or dog-skins for ermine;" yet their prices
were by no means considerable. Two Lear's dresses, two Dutch
and one Jew's ditto, sold for thirty-five shillings; one spangled
Harlequin's dress, one clown's, one magician's, and pantaloon's, came to
one pound eleven shillings and sixpence; five priests' and a cardinal's
dress, and the next lot, six robbers' dresses and a cardinal's dress,
went very low; and six satyrs' dresses were absolutely given away.
A large scene waggon brought fourteen pounds, and a ditto scene
carriage only eight pounds. Then there were sundries of curious
character in the catalogue:</p>

<p class="indent">Ten common w<i>h</i>igs, trick-bottle, and trick-box
(probably what Stanley called the thimble-rig).</p>

<p class="indent">A trick-sword, a coffin and pall: tomb of <i>Capulate</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The</i> old oak chest, with skeleton and two inscriptions
(a very superior property).</p>

<p class="indent">A spangled woman's dress, white gown, &amp;c. complete.</p>

<p class="indent">Two handsome spangled women's dresses, with caps, complete.</p>

<p class="indent">Five chintz women's dresses, two bow [qy. beau?] strings and
scarf, eight fans, four baskets, and fifteen tails.</p>

<p class="indent">A man's ghost dress, complete.</p>

<p class="indent">A handsome woman's velvet dress, and Roman father's ditto.</p>

<p class="indent">Three magicians' dresses, and five musicians' ditto.</p>

<p class="indent">Nine spangled flys.</p>

<p class="indent">A handsome demon's dress, spangled and ornamented with gilt
[guilt] mask, and mace.</p>

<p class="indent">Four demons' dresses, with <i>masks, complete</i>!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Executioner's</i> dress and cap, complete; six black gowns,
and <i>four falls</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">A superfine admiral's coat and hat, trimmed with gold lace,
breeches, and waistcoat.</p>

<p class="indent">Ditto (no breeches).</p>

<p class="indent">Lion, bear, monkey, and cat's dresses, with two masks.</p>

<p class="indent">Two handsome <i>nondescript</i> dresses.</p>

<p class="indent">Such and so various were the articles in this unique three
days' sale; and in the last some pieces of good old china were knocked
down. Three weeks previously their owner was deposited in the
cold church-yard of Great Marlow, in the grave, we are assured, of
the Spotted Boy. The funeral was, at his request, conducted without
<i>Show</i>; and his nephews and nieces&mdash;for he left no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
family&mdash;inherit his worldly wealth, under the executorship of Mr. Cross,
the proprietor of the Surrey Zoological Garden and its giraffery.</p>

<p class="indent">Many actors who have risen to celebrity began their course
with him: Kean, first as outside and inside tumbling boy, and afterwards
as a lending tragedian, with a salary of five shillings a day;
Oxberry, Mitchell, Walbourn, and Sanders, A. Slader, Thwaites,
Vaughan, S. Faucett, &amp;c. were introduced to the public under his
auspices. Who now shall open the gates of the temple to dramatic
fame? The Janitor is gone for ever. A hearse is the last omnibus,
after all. A hearse is the end of the showman's caravans, and the
sexton is the last toll-collector he encounters in this world. John
Richardson,</p>

<h2>RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD.</h2>
<p class="f90">BY THE AUTHOR OF <b>HEADLONG HALL</b>.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="f110 space-below1"><b>THE ABBEY HOUSE.</b></p>

<p class="indent">I passed many of my earliest days in a country town, on
whose immediate outskirts stood an ancient mansion, bearing the name of
the Abbey House. This mansion has long since vanished from the
face of the earth; but many of my pleasantest youthful recollections
are associated with it, and in my mind's eye I still see it as it stood,
with its amiable, simple-mannered, old English inhabitants.</p>

<p class="indent">The house derived its name from standing near, though not
actually on, the site of one of those rich old abbies, whose demesnes the
pure devotion of Henry the Eighth transferred from their former
occupants (who foolishly imagined they had a right to them, though
they lacked the might which is its essence,) to the members of his
convenient parliamentary chorus, who helped him to run down his
Scotch octave of wives. Of the abbey itself a very small portion remained:
a gateway, and a piece of a wall which formed part of the
enclosure of an orchard, wherein a curious series of fish-ponds, connected
by sluices, was fed from a contiguous stream with a perpetual
circulation of fresh water,&mdash;a sort of piscatorial panopticon, where all
approved varieties of fresh-water fish had been classified, each in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
own pond, and kept in good order, clean and fat, for the mortification
of the flesh of the monastic brotherhood on fast-days.</p>

<p class="indent">The road which led to the Abbey House terminated as a
carriage-road with the house itself. Beyond it, a footpath over meadows
conducted across a ferry to a village about a mile distant. A large clump
of old walnut-trees stood on the opposite side of the road to a pair of
massy iron gates, which gave entrance to a circular gravel road,
encompassing a large smooth lawn, with a sun-dial in the centre, and
bordered on both sides with tall thick evergreens and flowering shrubs,
interspersed in the seasons with hollyhocks, sun-flowers, and other
gigantic blossoms, such as are splendid in distance. Within, immediately
opposite the gates, a broad flight of stone steps led to a ponderous
portal, and to a large antique hall, laid with a chequered pavement
of black and white marble. On the left side of the entrance was the
porter's chair, consisting of a cushioned seat, occupying the depth of
a capacious recess resembling a niche for a full-sized statue, a
well-stuffed body of black leather glittering with gold-headed nails. On
the right of this hall was the great staircase; on the left a passage to
a wing appropriated to the domestics.</p>

<p class="indent">Facing the portal, a door opened into an inner hall, in the
centre of which was a billiard-table. On the right of this hall was a library;
on the left a parlour, which was the common sitting-room; and facing
the middle door was a glazed door, opening on the broad flight of
stone steps which led into the gardens.</p>

<p class="indent">The gardens were in the old style: a large square lawn occupied
an ample space in the centre, separated by broad walks from belts of trees
and shrubs on each side; and in front were two advancing groves,
with a long wide vista between them, looking to the open country,
from which the grounds were separated by a terraced wall over a
deep sunken dyke. One of the groves we called the green grove, and
the other the dark grove. The first had a pleasant glade, with sloping
banks covered with flowery turf; the other was a mass of trees, too
closely canopied with foliage for grass to grow beneath them.</p>

<p class="indent">The family consisted of a gentleman and his wife, with two
daughters and a son. The eldest daughter was on the confines of womanhood,
the youngest was little more than a child; the son was between
them. I do not know his exact age, but I was seven or eight, and he
was two or three years more.</p>

<p class="indent">The family lived, from taste, in a very retired manner; but
to the few whom they received they were eminently hospitable. I was perhaps
the foremost among these few; for Charles, who was my schoolfellow,
was never happy in our holidays unless I was with him. A
frequent guest was an elderly male relation, much respected by the
family,&mdash;but no favourite of Charles, over whom he was disposed to
assume greater authority than Charles was willing to acknowledge.</p>

<p class="indent">The mother and daughter had all the solid qualities which
were considered female virtues in the dark ages. Our enlightened age has,
wisely no doubt, discarded many of them, and substituted show for
solidity. The dark ages preferred the natural blossom, and the fruit
that follows it; the enlightened age prefers the artificial double-blossom,
which falls and leaves nothing. But the double blossom is brilliant
while it lasts; and when there is so much light, there ought to
be something to glitter in it.

<p class="indent">These ladies had the faculty of staying at home; and this
was a principal among the antique faculties that upheld the rural mansions of
the middling gentry. Ask Brighton, Cheltenham, <i>et id genus omne</i>,
what has become of that faculty. And ask the ploughshare what has
become of the rural mansions.</p>

<p class="indent">They never, I think, went out of their own grounds but to
church, or to take their regular daily airing in the old family-carriage. The
young lady was an adept in preserving: she had one room, in a
corner of the hall, between the front and the great staircase, entirely
surrounded with shelves in compartments, stowed with classified
sweetmeats, jellies, and preserved fruits, the work of her own sweet
hands. These were distinguished ornaments of the supper-table; for
the family dined early, and maintained the old fashion of supper. A
child would not easily forget the bountiful and beautiful array of
fruits, natural and preserved, and the ample variety of preparations of
milk, cream, and custard, by which they were accompanied. The
supper-table had matter for all tastes. I remember what was most
to mine.</p>

<p class="indent">The young lady performed on the harpsichord. Over what a
gulph of time this name alone looks back! What a stride from that harpsichord
to one of Broadwood's last grand-pianos! And yet with what
pleasure, as I stood by the corner of the instrument, I listened to it,
or rather to her! I would give much to know that the worldly lot of
this gentle and amiable creature had been a happy one. She often gently
remonstrated with me for putting her harpsichord out of tune by playing
the bells upon it; but I was never in a serious scrape with her except
once. I had insisted on taking from the nursery-maid the handle of
the little girl's garden-carriage, with which I set off at full speed; and
had not run many yards before I overturned the carriage, and rolled
out the little girl. The child cried like Alice Fell, and would not be
pacified. Luckily she ran to her sister, who let me off with an admonition,
and the exaction of a promise never to meddle again with the
child's carriage.</p>

<p class="indent">Charles was fond of romances. The "Mysteries of Udolpho," and
all the ghost and goblin stories of the day, were his familiar reading. I
cared little about them at that time; but he amused me by narrating
their grimmest passages. He was very anxious that the Abbey House
should be haunted; but it had no strange sights or sounds, and no
plausible tradition to hang a ghost on. I had very nearly accommodated
him with what he wanted.</p>

<p class="indent">The garden-front of the house was covered with jasmine,
and it was a pure delight to stand in the summer twilight on the top of the
stone steps inhaling the fragrance of the multitudinous blossoms. One
evening, as I was standing on these steps alone, I saw something like
the white head-dress of a tall figure advance from the right-hand
grove,&mdash;the dark grove, as we called it,&mdash;and, after a brief interval,
recede. This, at any rate, looked awful. Presently it appeared again,
and again vanished. On which I jumped to my conclusion, and flew into
the parlour with the announcement that there was a ghost in the dark
grove. The whole family sallied forth to see the phenomenon. The
appearances and disappearances continued. All conjectured what it
could be, but none could divine. In a minute or two all the servants
were in the hall. They all tried their skill, and were all equally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
unable to solve the riddle. At last, the master of the house leading the
way, we marched in a body to the spot, and unravelled the mystery.
It was a large bunch of flowers on the top of a tall lily, waving in the
wind at the edge of the grove, and disappearing at intervals behind
the stem of a tree. My ghost, and the compact phalanx in which we
sallied against it, were long the subject of merriment. It was a cruel
disappointment to Charles, who was obliged to abandon all hopes of
having the house haunted.</p>

<p class="indent">One day Charles was in disgrace with his elderly relation,
who had exerted sufficient authority to make him a captive in his chamber.
He was prohibited from seeing any one but me; and, of course,
a most urgent messenger was sent to me express. I found him in
his chamber, sitting by the fire, with a pile of ghostly tales, and an
accumulation of lead, which he was casting into dumps in a mould.
Dumps, the inexperienced reader must know, are flat circles of lead,&mdash;a
sort of petty quoits,&mdash;with which schoolboys amused themselves half
a century ago, and perhaps do so still, unless the march of mind has
marched off with such vanities. No doubt, in the "astounding progress
of intellect," the time will arrive when boys will play at philosophers
instead of playing at soldiers,&mdash;will fight with wooden arguments
instead of wooden swords,&mdash;and pitch leaden syllogisms instead
of leaden dumps. Charles was before the dawn of this new light.
He had cast several hundred dumps, and was still at work. The
quibble did not occur to me at the time; but, in after years, I never
heard of a man in the dumps without thinking of my schoolfellow.
His position was sufficiently melancholy. His chamber was at the
end of a long corridor. He was determined not to make any submission,
and his captivity was likely to last till the end of his holidays.
Ghost-stories, and lead for dumps, were his stores and provisions for
standing the siege of <i>ennui</i>. I think, with the aid of his sister,
I had some share in making his peace; but, such is the association of
ideas, that, when I first read in Lord Byron's Don Juan,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I pass my evenings in long galleries solely,</span>
<span class="i0">And that's the reason I'm so melancholy,"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="space-below1">the lines immediately conjured up the image of poor
Charles in the midst of his dumps and spectres at the end of his own long gallery.</p>

<p class="f110"><b>THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.</b></p>

<p class="indent space-above1">"It is very odd, though, what can have become of
them?" said Charles Seaforth, as he peeped under the valance of an old-fashioned
bedstead, in an old-fashioned apartment of a still more old-fashioned
manor-house; "'tis confounded odd, and I can't make it out at all.
Why, Barney, where are they? and where the d&mdash;l are you?"</p>

<p class="indent">No answer was returned to this appeal; and the lieutenant, who
was in the main a reasonable person,&mdash;at least as reasonable a person as
any young gentleman of twenty-two in "the service" can fairly be expected
to be,&mdash;cooled when he reflected that his servant could scarcely
reply extempore to a summons which it was impossible he should hear.</p>

<p class="indent">An application to the bell was the considerate result; and the
footsteps of as tight a lad as ever put pipe-clay to belt sounded along the gallery.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come in!" said his master. An ineffectual attempt upon
the door reminded Mr. Seaforth that he had locked himself in. "By Heaven!
this is the oddest thing of all," said he, as he turned the key and
admitted Mr. Maguire into his dormitory.</p>

<p class="indent">"Barney, where are my pantaloons?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it the breeches?" asked the valet, casting an
inquiring eye round the apartment; "is it the breeches, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes; what have you done with them?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Sure then your honour had them on when you went to bed,
and it's hereabouts they'll be, I'll be bail;" and Barney lifted a
fashionable tunic from a cane-backed arm-chair, proceeding in his
examination. But the search was vain. There was the tunic aforesaid,&mdash;there
was a smart-looking kerseymere waistcoat; but the most important
article in a gentleman's wardrobe was still wanting.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where <i>can</i> they be?" asked the master with a
strong accent on the auxiliary verb.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sorrow a know I knows," said the man.</p>

<p class="indent">"It must have been the devil, then, after all, who has been here
and carried them off!" cried Seaforth, staring full into Barney's face.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Maguire was not devoid of the superstition of his countrymen,
but he looked as if he did not subscribe to the <i>sequitur</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">His master read incredulity in his countenance. "Why, I tell you,
Barney, I put them there, on that arm-chair, when I got into bed; and,
by Heaven! I distinctly saw the ghost of the old fellow they told me of,
come in at midnight, put on my pantaloons, and walk away with them."</p>

<p class="indent">"Maybe so," was the cautious reply.</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought, of course, it was a dream;
but then,&mdash;where the d&mdash;l are the breeches?"</p>

<p class="indent">The question was more easily asked than answered. Barney
renewed his search, while the lieutenant folded his arms, and, leaning
against the toilet, sunk into a reverie.</p>

<p class="indent">"After all, it must be some trick of my
laughter-loving cousins," said Seaforth.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! then, the ladies!" chimed in Mr. Maguire, though
the observation was not addressed to him; "and will it be Miss Caroline, or
Miss Margaret, that's stole your honour's things?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"I hardly know what to think of it," pursued the bereaved
lieutenant, still speaking in soliloquy, with his eye resting dubiously on the
chamber door. "I locked myself in, that's certain; and&mdash;but there
must be some other entrance to the room&mdash;pooh! I remember&mdash;the private
staircase: how could I be such a fool?" and he crossed the chamber
to where a low oaken door-case was dimly visible in a distant corner.
He paused before it. Nothing now interfered to screen it from observation;
but it bore tokens of having been at some earlier period concealed
by tapestry, remains of which yet clothed the walls on either
side the portal.</p>

<p class="indent">"This way they must have come," said Seaforth;
"I wish with all my heart I had caught them!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Och! the kittens!" sighed Mr. Barney Maguire.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">But the mystery was yet as far from being solved as
before. True, there <i>was</i> the "other door;" but then that, too, on examination,
was even more firmly secured than the one which opened on the gallery,&mdash;two
heavy bolts on the inside effectually prevented any <i>coup de main</i>
on the lieutenant's <i>bivouac</i> from that quarter. He was more puzzled
than ever; nor did the minutest inspection of the walls and floor throw
any light upon the subject: one thing only was clear,&mdash;the breeches
were gone! "It is <i>very</i> singular," said the lieutenant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent space-above1">Tappington (generally called Tapton) Everard, is
an antiquated but commodious manor-house in the eastern division of the county of
Kent. A former proprietor had been high sheriff in the days of Elizabeth,
and many a dark and dismal tradition was yet extant of the licentiousness
of his life, and the enormity of his offences. The Glen, which
the keeper's daughter was seen to enter, but never known to quit,
still frowns darkly as of yore; while an ineradicable bloodstain on the
oaken stair yet bids defiance to the united energies of soap and sand.
But it is with one particular apartment that a deed of more especial
atrocity is said to be connected. A stranger guest&mdash;so runs the
legend&mdash;arrived unexpectedly at the mansion of the "Bad Sir Giles."
They met in apparent friendship; but the ill-concealed scowl on their
master's brow told the domestics that the visit was not a welcome one.
The banquet, however, was not spared; the wine-cup circulated freely,&mdash;too
freely, perhaps,&mdash;for sounds of discord at length reached the
ears of even the excluded serving-men as they were doing their best
to imitate their betters in the lower hall. Alarmed, some of them
ventured to approach the parlour; one, an old and favoured retainer
of the house, went so far as to break in upon his master's privacy.
Sir Giles, already high in oath, fiercely enjoined his absence, and he
retired; not, however, before he had distinctly heard from the
stranger's lips a menace that "There was that within his pocket
which could disprove the knight's right to issue that, or any other,
command within the walls of Tapton."</p>

<p class="indent">The intrusion, though momentary, seemed to have produced a
beneficial effect; the voices of the disputants fell, and the conversation
was carried on thenceforth in a more subdued tone, till, as evening
closed in, the domestics, when summoned to attend with lights, found
not only cordiality restored, but that a still deeper carouse was
meditated. Fresh stoups, and from the choicest bins, were produced;
nor was it till at a late, or rather early, hour, that the revellers
sought their chambers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The one allotted to the stranger occupied the first floor of
the eastern angle of the building, and had once been the favourite apartment
of Sir Giles himself. Scandal ascribed this preference to the
facility which a private staircase, communicating with the grounds,
had afforded him, in the old knight's time, of following his wicked
courses unchecked by parental observation; a consideration which
ceased to be of weight when the death of his father left him uncontrolled
master of his estate and actions. From that period Sir Giles
had established himself in what were called the "state-apartments;"
and the "oaken chamber" was rarely tenanted, save on occasions of
extraordinary festivity, or when the Yule log drew an unusually
large accession of guests around the Christmas hearth.</p>

<p class="indent">On this eventful night it was prepared for the unknown
visitor, who sought his couch heated and inflamed from his midnight orgies,
and in the morning was found in his bed a swollen and blackened
corpse. No marks of violence appeared upon the body; but the livid
hue of the lips, and certain dark-coloured spots visible on the skin,
aroused suspicions which those who entertained them were too timid
to express. Apoplexy, induced by the excesses of the preceding night,
Sir Giles's confidential leech pronounced to be the cause of his sudden
dissolution: the body was buried in peace; and, though some shook
their heads as they witnessed the haste with which the funeral rites
were hurried on, none ventured to murmur. Other events arose to
distract the attention of the retainers; men's minds became occupied
by the stirring politics of the day, while the near approach of that
formidable armada, so vainly arrogating to itself a title which the
very elements joined with human valour to disprove, soon interfered to
weaken, if not obliterate, all remembrance of the nameless stranger
who had died within the walls of Tapton Everard.</p>

<p class="indent">Years rolled on: the "Bad Sir Giles" had himself long since
gone to his account, the last, as it was believed, of his immediate line;
though a few of the older tenants were sometimes heard to speak of
an elder brother, who had disappeared in early life, and never inherited
the estate. Rumours, too, of his having left a son in foreign lands
were at one time rife; but they died away, nothing occurring to support
them: the property passed unchallenged to a collateral branch of
the family, and the secret, if secret there were, was buried in Denton
churchyard, in the lonely grave of the mysterious stranger. One
circumstance alone occurred, after a long intervening period, to revive
the memory of these transactions. Some workmen employed in grubbing
an old plantation, for the purpose of raising on its site a modern
shrubbery, dug up, in the execution of their task, the mildewed remnants
of what seemed to have been once a garment. On more minute inspection,
enough remained of silken slashes and a coarse embroidery to
identify the relics as having once formed part of a pair of trunk hose;
while a few papers which fell from them, altogether illegible from
damp and age, were by the unlearned rustics conveyed to the then
owner of the estate.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether the squire was more successful in deciphering them
was never known; he certainly never alluded to their contents; and little
would have been thought of the matter but for the inconvenient memory
of one old woman, who declared she had heard her grandfather say
that when the "stranger guest" was poisoned, though all the rest of
his clothes were there, his breeches, the supposed repository of the
supposed documents, could never be found. The master of Tapton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Everard smiled when he heard Dame Jones's hint of deeds which
might impeach the validity of his own title in favour of some unknown
descendant of some unknown heir; and the story was rarely alluded to,
save by one or two miracle-mongers, who had heard that others had
seen the ghost of old Sir Giles, in his night-cap, issue from the postern,
enter the adjoining copse, and wring his shadowy hands in agony as he
seemed to search vainly for something hidden among the evergreens.
The stranger's death-room had, of course, been occasionally haunted
from the time of his decease; but the periods of visitation had latterly
become very rare,&mdash;even Mrs. Botherby, the housekeeper, being forced
to admit that, during her long sojourn at the manor, she had never
"met with anything worse than herself;" though, as the old lady
afterwards added upon more mature reflection, "I must say I think I
saw the devil once."</p>

<p class="indent">Such was the legend attached to Tapton Everard, and such the
story which the lively Caroline Ingoldsby detailed to her equally mercurial
cousin Charles Seaforth, lieutenant in the Hon. East India Company's
second regiment of Bombay Fencibles, as arm-in-arm they promenaded
a gallery decked with some dozen grim-looking ancestral portraits, and,
among others, with that of the redoubted Sir Giles himself. The gallant
commander had that very morning paid his first visit to the house of
his maternal uncle, after an absence of several years passed with his
regiment on the arid plains of Hindostan, whence he was now returned
on a three years' furlough. He had gone out a boy,&mdash;he returned a
man; but the impression made upon his youthful fancy by his favourite
cousin remained unimpaired, and to Tapton he directed his steps,
even before he sought the home of his widowed mother,&mdash;comforting
himself in this breach of filial decorum by the reflection that, as the
manor was so little out of his way, it would be unkind to pass, as it
were, the door of his relatives without just looking in for a few hours.</p>

<p class="indent">But he found his uncle as hospitable and his cousin more
charming than ever; and the looks of one, and the requests of the other, soon
precluded the possibility of refusing to lengthen the "few hours" into
a few days, though the house was at the moment full of visitors.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The Peterses were there from Ramsgate; and Mr.,
Mrs., and the two Miss Simpkinsons, from Bath, had come to pass a month with the
family; and Tom Ingoldsby had brought down his college friend the
Honourable Augustus Sucklethumbkin, with his groom and pointers,
to take a fortnight's shooting. And then there was Mrs. Ogleton, the
rich young widow, with her large black eyes, who, people did say, was
setting her cap at the young squire, though Mrs. Botherby did not believe
it; and, above all, there was Mademoiselle Pauline; her <i>femme de
chambre</i>, who "<i>Mon-Dieu</i>'d" everything and everybody, and cried
"<i>Quel horreur!</i>" at Mrs. Botherby's cap. In short, to use the
last-named and much respected lady's own expression, the house was
"choke-full" to the very attics,&mdash;all, save the "oaken chamber," which,
as the lieutenant expressed a most magnanimous disregard of ghosts,
was forthwith appropriated to his particular accommodation. Mr. Maguire
meanwhile was fain to share the apartment of Oliver Dobbs, the
squire's own man; a jocular proposal of joint occupancy having been
first indignantly rejected by "Mademoiselle," though preferred with
the "laste taste in life" of Mr. Barney's most insinuating brogue.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent space-above1">"Come, Charles, the urn is absolutely getting cold;
your breakfast will be quite spoiled: what can have made you so idle?" Such was
the morning salutation of Miss Ingoldsby to the <i>militaire</i> as he
entered the breakfast-room half an hour after the latest of the party.</p>

<p class="indent">"A pretty gentleman, truly, to make an appointment with," chimed
in Miss Margaret. "What is become of our ramble to the rocks before
breakfast?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! the young men never think of keeping a promise now," said
Mrs. Peters, a little ferret-faced woman with underdone eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">"When I was a young man," said Mr. Peters,
"I remember I always made a point of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Pray how long ago was that?" asked Mr. Simpkinson from Bath.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, sir, when I married Mrs. Peters,
I was&mdash;let me see&mdash;I was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do pray hold your tongue, P., and eat your breakfast!" interrupted
his better half, who had a mortal horror of chronological references;
"it's very rude to tease people with your family affairs."</p>

<p class="indent">The lieutenant had by this time taken his seat in
silence,&mdash;a good-humoured nod, and a glance, half-smiling, half-inquisitive,
being the extent of his salutation. Smitten as he was, and in the immediate
presence of her who had made so large a hole in his heart, his manner
was evidently <i>distrait</i>, which the fair Caroline in her secret soul
attributed to his being solely occupied by her <i>agrémens</i>,&mdash;how
would she have bridled had she known that they only shared his
meditations with a pair of breeches!</p>

<p class="indent">Charles drank his coffee and spiked some half-dozen eggs, darting
occasionally a penetrating glance at the ladies, in hope of detecting
the supposed waggery by the evidence of some furtive smile or conscious
look. But in vain! not a dimple moved indicative of roguery,
nor did the slightest elevation of eyebrow rise confirmative of his
suspicions. Hints and insinuations passed unheeded,&mdash;more particular
inquiries were out of the question:&mdash;the subject was unapproachable.</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">In the mean time, "patent cords" were just the
thing for a morning's ride, and, breakfast ended, away cantered the party over
the downs, till, every faculty absorbed by the beauties, animate and inanimate,
which surrounded him, Lieutenant Seaforth of the Bombay
Fencibles bestowed no more thought upon his breeches than if he had
been born on the top of Ben Lomond.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent space-above1">Another night had passed away; the sun rose
brilliantly, forming with his level beams a splendid rainbow in the far-off west,
whither the heavy cloud, which for the last two hours had been pouring its
waters on the earth, was now flying before him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! then, and it's little good it'll be the claning of ye,"
apostrophised Mr. Barney Maguire, as he deposited, in front of his master's
toilet, a pair of "bran-new" jockey boots, one of Hoby's primest fits,
which the lieutenant had purchased in his way through town. On
that very morning had they come for the first time under the valet's
depuriating hand, so little soiled, indeed, from the turfy ride of the
preceding day, that a less scrupulous domestic might, perhaps have
considered the application of "Warren's Matchless," or oxalic acid,
altogether superfluous. Not so Barney: with the nicest care had he
removed the slightest impurity from each polished surface, and there
they stood rejoicing in their sable radiance. No wonder a pang shot
across Mr. Maguire's breast as he thought on the work now cut out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
for them, so different from the light labours of the day before; no
wonder he murmured with a sigh, as the scarce dried window-panes
disclosed a road now inch-deep in mud. "Ah! then, it's little good
the claning of ye!"&mdash;for well had he learned in the hell below that
eight miles of a stiff clay soil lay between the manor and Bolsover
Abbey, whose picturesque ruins,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 6em;">"Like ancient Rome, majestic in decay,"</span></p>

<p class="space-below1">the party had determined to explore. The master had
already commenced dressing, and the man was fitting straps upon a light pair
of crane-necked spurs, when his hand was arrested by the old
question,&mdash;"Barney, where are the breeches?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent space-above1">Mr. Seaforth descended that morning, whip in hand,
and equipped in a handsome green riding-frock, but no "breeches and boots to
match" were there: loose jean trousers, surmounting a pair of diminutive
Wellingtons, embraced, somewhat incongruously, his nether
man, <i>vice</i> the "patent cords," returned, like yesterday's pantaloons,
absent without leave. The "top-boots" had a holiday.</p>

<p class="indent">"A fine morning after the rain," said Mr. Simpkinson from Bath.</p>

<p class="indent">"Just the thing for the 'ops," said Mr. Peters.
"I remember when I was a boy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do hold your tongue, P.," said Mrs. Peters,&mdash;advice which
that exemplary matron was in the constant habit of administering to "her P.,"
as she called him, whenever he prepared to vent his reminiscences.
Her precise reason for this it would be difficult to determine, unless,
indeed, the story be true which a little bird had whispered into Mrs.
Botherby's ear,&mdash;Mr. Peters, though now a wealthy man, had received
a liberal education at a charity-school, and was apt to recur to
the days of his muffin-cap and leathers. As usual, he took his wife's
hint in good part, and "paused in his reply."</p>

<p class="indent">"A glorious day for the Ruins!" said young Ingoldsby. "But,
Charles, what the deuce are you about?&mdash;you don't mean to ride
through our lanes in such toggery as that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Lassy me!" said Miss Julia Simpkinson,
"won't you be very wet?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You had better take Tom's cab," quoth the squire.</p>

<p class="indent">But this proposition was at once overruled; Mrs. Ogleton
had already nailed the cab, a vehicle of all others the best adapted for a
snug flirtation.</p>

<p class="indent">"Or drive Miss Julia in the phaeton?" No; that was the post
of Mr. Peters, who, indifferent as an equestrian, had acquired some fame
as a whip while travelling through the midland counties for the firm
of Bagshaw, Snivelby, and Ghrimes.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">"Thank you, I shall ride with my cousins," said Charles with as
much <i>nonchalance</i> as he could assume,&mdash;and he did so; Mr. Ingoldsby,
Mrs. Peters, Mr. Simpkinson from Bath, and his eldest daughter with
her <i>album</i>, following in the family coach. The gentleman-commoner
"voted the affair d&mdash;d slow," and declined the party altogether in
favour of the gamekeeper and a cigar. "There was 'no fun' in looking
at old houses!" Mrs. Simpkinson preferred a short <i>séjour</i> in the
still-room with Mrs. Botherby, who had promised to initiate her in
that grand <i>arcanum</i>, the transmutation of gooseberry jam into Guava jelly.

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent space-above1">"Did you ever see an old abbey before, Mr. Peters?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, miss, a French one; we have got one at Ramsgate; he
teaches the Miss Joneses to parleyvoo, and is turned of sixty."</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Simpkinson closed her album with an air of ineffable disdain.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Simpkinson from Bath was a professed antiquary, and
one of the first water; he was master of Gwillim's Heraldry, and Milles's
History of the Crusades; knew every plate in the Monasticon, had
written an essay on the origin and dignity of the office of Overseer,
and settled the date of a Queen Anne's farthing. An influential member
of the Antiquarian Society, to whose "Beauties of Bagnigge Wells" he
had been a liberal subscriber, procured him a seat at the board of that
learned body, since which happy epoch Sylvanus Urban had not a
more indefatigable correspondent. His inaugural essay on the President's
cocked hat was considered a miracle of erudition; and his account
of the earliest application of gilding to gingerbread, a masterpiece of
antiquarian research. His eldest daughter was of a kindred spirit: if
her father's mantle had not fallen upon her, it was only because he
had not thrown it off himself; she had caught hold of its tail, however,
while yet upon his honoured shoulders. To souls so congenial what a sight
was the magnificent ruin of Bolsover! its broken arches, its mouldering
pinnacles, and the airy tracery of its half-demolished windows. The
party was in raptures; Mr. Simpkinson began to meditate an essay, and
his daughter an ode: even Seaforth, as he gazed on these lonely relics
of the olden time, was betrayed into a momentary forgetfulness of his
love and losses; the widow's eye-glass turned from her <i>cicisbeo</i>'s
whiskers to the mantling ivy; Mrs. Peters wiped her spectacles; and "her
P." pronounced the central tower to be "very like a mouldy Stilton
cheese,&mdash;only bigger." The squire was a philosopher, and had been
there often before; so he ordered out the cold tongue and chickens.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bolsover Priory," said Mr. Simpkinson with the air of a
connoisseur,&mdash;"Bolsover Priory was founded in the reign of Henry the
Sixth, about the beginning of the eleventh century. Hugh de Bolsover had
accompanied that monarch to the Holy Land in the expedition undertaken
by way of penance for the murder of his young nephews in the
Tower. Upon the dissolution of the monasteries the veteran was enfeoffed
in the lands and manor, to which he gave his own name of
Bowlsover, or Bee-owls-over, (by corruption Bolsover,)&mdash;a Bee in
chief, over three Owls, all proper, being the armorial ensigns borne by
this distinguished crusader at the siege of Acre."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! that was Sir Sidney Smith," said Mr. Peters; "I've heard
of him, and all about Mrs. Partington, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"P. be quiet, and don't expose yourself!" sharply interrupted his
lady. P. was silenced, and betook himself to the bottled stout.</p>

<p class="indent">"These lands," continued the antiquary, "were held in grand serjeantry
by the presentation of three white owls and a pot of honey&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lassy me! how nice!" said Miss Julia. Mr. Peters licked his
lips.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pray give me leave, my dear&mdash;&mdash;owls and honey, whenever the
king should come a rat-catching into this part of the country."</p>

<p class="indent">"Rat-catching!" ejaculated the squire, pausing abruptly in the
mastication of a drumstick.</p>

<p class="indent">"To be sure, my dear sir: don't you remember that rats once came
under the forest laws&mdash;a minor species of venison? 'Rats and mice,
and such small deer,' eh?&mdash;Shakspeare, you know. Our ancestors ate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
rats;" ("The nasty fellows!" shuddered Miss Julia in a parenthesis)
"and owls, you know, are capital mousers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I've seen a howl," said Mr. Peters; "there's one in the Sohological
Gardens,&mdash;a little hook-nosed chap in a wig,&mdash;only it's feathers
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Poor P. was destined never to finish a speech.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Do</i> be quiet!" cried the authoritative voice, and the would-be
naturalist shrank into his shell like a snail in the "Sohological Gardens."</p>

<p class="indent">"You should read Blount's 'Jocular Tenures,' Mr. Ingoldsby,"
pursued Simpkinson. "A learned man was Blount! Why, sir, his
Royal Highness the Duke of York once paid a silver horse-shoe to Lord
Ferrers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I've heard of him," broke in the incorrigible Peters; "he was
hanged at the Old Bailey in a silk rope for shooting Doctor Johnson."</p>

<p class="indent">The antiquary vouchsafed no notice of the interruption; but, taking
a pinch of snuff, continued his harangue.</p>

<p class="indent">"A silver horse-shoe, sir, which is due from every scion of royalty
who rides across one of his manors; and if you look into the penny
county histories, now publishing by an eminent friend of mine, you will
find that Langhale in Co. Norf. was held by one Baldwin <i>per saltum
sufflatum, et pettum</i>; that is, he was to come every Christmas into
Westminster Hall, there to take a leap, cry hem! and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Simpkinson, a glass of sherry?" cried Tom Ingoldsby hastily.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not any, thank you, sir. This Baldwin, surnamed <i>Le &mdash;&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">"Mrs. Ogleton challenges you, sir; she insists upon it," said Tom
still more rapidly; at the same time filling a glass, and forcing it on the
sçavant, who, thus arrested in the very crisis of his narrative, received
and swallowed the potation as if it had been physic.</p>

<p class="indent">"What on earth has Miss Simpkinson discovered there?" continued
Tom; "something of interest. See how fast she is writing."</p>

<p class="indent">The diversion was effectual; every one looked towards Miss
Simpkinson, who, far too ethereal for "creature comforts," was seated apart
on the dilapidated remains of an altar-tomb, committing eagerly to
paper something that had strongly impressed her: the air,&mdash;the eye in
a fine frenzy rolling,&mdash;all betokened that the divine <i>afflatus</i> was come.
Her father rose, and stole silently towards her.</p>

<p class="indent">"What an old boar!" muttered young Ingoldsby; alluding, perhaps,
to a slice of brawn which he had just begun to operate upon, but which,
from the celerity with which it disappeared, did not seem so very difficult
of mastication.</p>

<p class="indent">But what had become of Seaforth and his fair Caroline all this
while? Why, it so happened that they had been simultaneously stricken with
the picturesque appearance of one of those high and pointed arches,
which that eminent antiquary, Mr. Horseley Curties, describes as "a
<i>Gothic</i> window of the <i>Saxon</i> order;"&mdash;and then the ivy clustered
so thickly and so beautifully on the other side, that they went round to
look at that;&mdash;and then their proximity deprived it of half its effect, and
so they walked across to a little knoll, a hundred yards off, and, in
crossing a small ravine, they came to what in Ireland they call "a bad
step," and Charles had to carry his cousin over it;&mdash;and then, when they
had to come back, she would not give him the trouble again for the
world, so they followed a better but more circuitous route, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
were hedges and ditches in the way, and stiles to get over, and gates
to get through; so that an hour or more had elapsed before they were
able to rejoin the party.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lassy me!" said Miss Julia Simpkinson, "how long you have been gone!"</p>

<p class="indent">And so they had. The remark was a very just as well as a very
natural one. They were gone a long while, and a nice cosey chat they
had; and what do you think it was all about, my dear miss?</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, lassy me! love, no doubt, and the moon, and eyes, and
nightingales, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Stay; stay, my sweet young lady; do not let the fervour of your
feelings run away with you! I do not pretend to say, indeed, that
one or more of these pretty subjects might not have been introduced;
but the most important and leading topic of the conference
was&mdash;Lieutenant Seaforth's breeches.</p>

<p class="indent">"Caroline," said Charles, "I have had some very odd dreams since
have been at Tappington."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dreams, have you?" smiled the young lady, arching her taper neck
like a swan in pluming. "Dreams, have you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, dreams,&mdash;or dream, perhaps, I should say; for, though
repeated, it was still the same. And what do you imagine was its subject?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It is impossible for me to divine," said the tongue; "I have not
the least difficulty in guessing," said the eye, as plainly as ever eye spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">"I dreamt of&mdash;your great grandfather!"</p>

<p class="indent">There was a change in the glance&mdash;"My great grandfather?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, the old Sir Giles, or Sir John, you told me about the
other day: he walked into my bedroom in his short cloak of murrey-coloured
velvet, his long rapier, and his Ralegh-looking hat and feather, just
as this picture represents him; but with one exception."</p>

<p class="indent">"And what was that?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, his lower extremities, which were visible,
were&mdash;those of a skeleton."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, after taking a turn or two about the room, and looking
round him with a wistful air, he came to the bed's foot, stared at me in a
manner impossible to describe,&mdash;and then he&mdash;he laid hold of my
pantaloons, whipped his long bony legs into them in a twinkling, and,
strutting up to the glass, seemed to view himself in it with great
complacency. I tried to speak, but in vain. The effort, however, seemed
to excite his attention; for, wheeling about, he showed me the
grimmest-looking death's head you can well imagine, and with an
indescribable grin strutted out of the room."</p>

<p class="indent">"Absurd, Charles! How can you talk such nonsense?"</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">"But, Caroline,&mdash;the breeches are really gone!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent space-above1">On the following morning, contrary to his usual
custom, Seaforth was the first person in the breakfast-parlour. As no one else
was present, he did precisely what nine young men out of ten so situated
would have done; he walked up to the mantelpiece, established himself
upon the rug, and subducting his coat-tails one under each arm,
turned towards the fire that portion of the human frame which it is
considered equally indecorous to present to a friend or an enemy. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
serious, not to say anxious, expression was visible upon his good-humoured
countenance, and his mouth was fast buttoning itself up for
an incipient whistle, when little Flo, a tiny spaniel of the Blenheim
breed,&mdash;the pet object of Miss Julia Simpkinson's affections,&mdash;bounced
out from beneath a sofa, and began to bark at&mdash;his pantaloons.</p>

<p class="indent">They were cleverly "built," of a light grey mixture, a broad
stripe of the most vivid scarlet traversing each seam in a perpendicular direction
from hip to ancle,&mdash;in short, the regimental costume of the Royal
Bombay Fencibles. The animal, educated in the country, had never
seen such a pair of breeches in her life&mdash;<i>Omne ignotum pro magnifico!</i>
The scarlet streak, inflamed as it was by the reflection of the fire,
seemed to act on Flora's nerves as the same colour does on those of
bulls and turkeys, she advanced at the <i>pas de charge</i>; and her vociferation,
like her amazement, was unbounded. A sound kick from the
disgusted officer changed its character, and induced a retreat at the
very moment when the mistress of the pugnacious quadruped entered
to the rescue.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lassy me! Flo! what <i>is</i> the matter?" cried the
sympathising lady, with a scrutinizing glance levelled at the gentleman.</p>

<p class="indent">It might as well have lighted on a feather-bed.&mdash;His
air of imperturbable unconsciousness defied examination; and as he would not,
and Flora could not, expound, that injured individual was compelled to
pocket up her wrongs. Others of the household soon dropped in, and
clustered round the board dedicated to the most sociable of meals; the
urn was paraded "hissing hot," and the cups which "cheer, but not
inebriate," steamed redolent of hyson and pekoe; muffins and marmalade,
newspapers and Finnon haddies, left little room for observation on
the character of Charles's warlike "turn-out." At length a look from
Caroline, followed by a smile that nearly ripened to a titter, caused him
to turn abruptly and address his neighbour. It was Miss Simpkinson,
who, deeply engaged in sipping her tea and turning over her album,
seemed, like a female Chrononotonthologos, "immersed in congibundity
of cogitation." An interrogatory on the subject of her studies drew
from her the confession that she was at that moment employed in putting
the finishing touches to a poem inspired by the romantic shades of
Bolsover. The entreaties of the company were of course urgent. Mr.
Peters, who "liked verses," was especially persevering, and Sappho at
length compliant. After a preparatory hem! and a glance at the mirror
to ascertain that her look was sufficiently sentimental, the poetess
began:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is a calm, a holy feeling,</span>
<span class="i2">Vulgar minds can never know,</span>
<span class="i0">O'er the bosom softly stealing,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">Chasten'd grief, delicious woe!</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! how sweet at eve regaining</span>
<span class="i2">Yon lone tower's sequester'd shade&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Sadly mute and uncomplaining&mdash;&mdash;"</span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;Yow!&mdash;yeough!&mdash;yeough!&mdash;yow!&mdash;yow! yelled a hapless
sufferer from beneath the table.&mdash;It was an unlucky hour for quadrupeds; and
if "every dog will have his day," he could not have selected a more
unpropitious one than this. Mrs. Ogleton, too, had a pet,&mdash;a favourite
pug,&mdash;whose squab figure, black muzzle, and tortuosity of tail, that
curled like a head of celery in a salad-bowl, bespoke his Dutch
extraction. Yow! yow! yow! continued the brute,&mdash;a chorus in which Flo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
instantly joined. Sooth to say, pug had more reason to express his
dissatisfaction than was given him by the muse of Simpkinson; the
other only barked for company. Scarcely had the poetess got through
her first stanza, when Tom Ingoldsby, in the enthusiasm of the moment,
became so lost to the material world, that, in his abstraction, he unwarily
laid his hand on the cock of the urn. Quivering with emotion, he
gave it such an unlucky twist, that the full stream of its scalding contents
descended on the gingerbread hide of the unlucky Cupid. The
confusion was complete; the whole economy of the table disarranged;
the company broke up in most admired disorder; and "vulgar minds
will never know" anything more of Miss Simpkinson's ode till they
peruse it in some forthcoming annual.</p>

<p class="indent">Seaforth profited by the confusion to take the delinquent
who had caused this "stramash" by the arm, and to lead him to the lawn,
where he had a word or two for his private ear. The conference between
the young gentlemen was neither brief in its duration, nor unimportant
in its result. The subject was what the lawyers call tripartite,
embracing the information that Charles Seaforth was over head and
ears in love with Tom Ingoldsby's sister; secondly, that the lady had
referred him to "papa" for his sanction; thirdly and lastly, his
nightly visitations and consequent bereavement. At the two first
items Tom smiled auspiciously; at the last he burst out into an
absolute "guffaw."</p>

<p class="indent">"Steal your breeches? Miss Bailey over again, by Jove!"
shouted Ingoldsby. "But a gentleman, you say, and Sir Giles too&mdash;I am
not sure, Charles, whether I ought not to call you out for aspersing the
honour of the family!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Laugh as you will, Tom,&mdash;be as incredulous as you please. One
fact is incontestible,&mdash;the breeches are gone! Look here&mdash;I am reduced
to my regimentals; and if these go, to-morrow I must borrow of you!"</p>

<p class="indent">Rochefoucault says, there in something in the misfortunes of
our very best friends that does not displease us; certainly we can, most of us,
laugh at their petty inconveniences, till called upon to supply them.
Tom composed his features on the instant, and replied with more
gravity, as well as with an expression, which, if my Lord Mayor had
been within hearing, might have cost him five shillings.</p>

<p class="indent">"There is something very queer in this, after all. The
clothes, you say, have positively disappeared. Somebody is playing you a
trick, and, ten to one, your servant has a hand in it. By the way, I heard
something yesterday of his kicking up a bobbery in the kitchen, and
seeing a ghost, or something of that kind, himself. Depend upon it,
Barney is in the plot!"</p>

<p class="indent">It struck the lieutenant at once that the usually buoyant spirits
of his attendant had of late been materially sobered down, his loquacity
obviously circumscribed, and that he, the said lieutenant, had actually
rung his bell three several times that very morning before he could
procure his attendance. Mr. Maguire was forthwith summoned, and
underwent a close examination. The "bobbery" was easily explained.
Mr. Oliver Dobbs had hinted his disapprobation of a flirtation carrying
on between the gentleman from Munster and the lady from the Rue
St. Honoré. Mademoiselle boxed Mr. Maguire's ears, and Mr. Maguire
pulled Mademoiselle upon his knee, and the lady did <i>not</i> cry
<i>Mon Dieu!</i> And Mr. Oliver Dobbs said it was very wrong; and Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Botherby said it was scandalous, and what ought not to be done in any
moral kitchen; and Mr. Maguire had got hold of the Honourable Augustus
Sucklethumbkin's powder-flask, and had put large pinches of the
best double Dartford into Mr. Dobbs' tobacco-box; and Mr. Dobbs'
pipe had exploded and set fire to Mrs. Botherby's Sunday cap, and Mr.
Maguire had put it out with the slop-basin, "barring the wig;" and
then they were all so "cantankerous," that Barney had gone to take
a walk in the garden; and then&mdash;then Mr. Barney had seen a ghost!</p>

<p class="indent">"A what? you blockhead!" asked Tom Ingoldsby.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sure then, and it's meself will tell your honour the rights
of it," said the ghost-seer. "Meself and Miss Pauline, sir&mdash;or Miss Pauline
and meself, for the ladies comes first any how,&mdash;we got tired of the
hobstroppylous skrimmaging among the ould servants, that didn't know
a joke when they seen one; and we went out to look at the Comet,&mdash;that's
the Rory-Bory-alehouse, they calls him in this country,&mdash;and we
walked upon the lawn, and divel of any alehouse there was there at
all; and Miss Pauline said it was becase of the shrubbery maybe, and
why wouldn't we see it better beyonst the trees? and so we went to
the trees, but sorrow a Comet did meself see there, barring a big ghost
instead of it."</p>

<p class="indent">"A ghost? And what sort of a ghost, Barney?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Och, then, divel a lie I'll tell your honour. A tall ould
gentleman he was, all in white, with a shovel on his shoulder, and a big torch
in his fist,&mdash;though what he wanted with that it's meself can't tell, for
his eyes were like gig-lamps, let alone the moon and the Comet, which
wasn't there at all; and 'Barney,' says he to me,&mdash;'cause why he knew
me,&mdash;'Barney,' says he, 'what is it you're doing with the colleen
there, Barney?' Divel a word did I say. Miss Pauline screeched, and
cried murther in French, and ran off with herself; and of coorse meself
was in a mighty hurry after the lady, and had no time to stop palavering
with him any way; so I dispersed at once, and the ghost vanished
in a flame of fire!"</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Maguire's account was received with avowed incredulity by
both gentlemen; but Barney stuck to his text with unflinching pertinacity.
A reference to Mademoiselle was suggested, but abandoned, as neither
party had a taste for delicate investigations.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">"I'll tell you what, Seaforth," said Ingoldsby, after
Barney had received his dismissal; "that there is a trick here, is evident; and
Barney's vision may possibly be a part of it. Whether he is most knave
or fool, you best know. At all events, I will sit up with you to-night,
and see if I can convert my ancestor into a visiting acquaintance.
Meanwhile your finger on your lip!"</p>

<span class="i3">When churchyards yawn, and graves give up their dead."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Gladly would I grace my tale with decent horror, and therefore
I do beseech the "gentle reader" to believe, that if all the <i>succedanea</i> to
this mysterious narrative are not in strict keeping, he will ascribe it only
to the disgraceful innovations of modern degeneracy upon the sober and
dignified habits of our ancestors. I can introduce him, it is true, into
an old and high-roofed chamber, its walls covered on three sides with
black oak wainscoting, adorned with carvings of fruit and flowers long
anterior to those of Grinling Gibbons; the fourth side is clothed with
a curious remnant of dingy tapestry, once elucidatory of some Scriptural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
history, but of <i>which</i> not even Mrs. Botherby could determine.
Mr. Simpkinson, who had examined it carefully, inclined to
believe the principal figure to be either Bathsheba or Daniel in the
lions' den; while Tom Ingoldsby decided in favour of the King of Bashan.
All, however, was conjecture; tradition being silent on the subject. A
lofty arched portal led into, and a little arched portal led out of, this
apartment; they were opposite each other, and both possessed the
security of massy bolts on the interior. The bedstead, too, was not one
of yesterday; but manifestly coeval with days ere Seddons was,
and when a good four-post "article" was deemed worthy of being a royal
bequest. The bed itself, with all the appurtenances of paillasse, mattresses,
&amp;c. was of far later date, and looked most incongruously comfortable;
the casements, too, with their little diamond-shaped panes
and iron binding, had given way to the modern heterodoxy of the
sash-window. Nor was this all that conspired to ruin the costume, and
render the room a meet haunt for such "mixed spirits" only as could
condescend to don at the same time an Elizabethan doublet and Bond-street
inexpressibles. With their green morocco slippers on a modern
fender in front of a disgracefully modern grate, sat two young gentlemen,
clad in "shawl-pattern" dressing-gowns and black silk stocks,
much at variance with the high cane-backed chairs which supported
them. A bunch of abomination, called a cigar, reeked in the left-hand
corner of the mouth of one, and in the right-hand corner of the mouth
of the other;&mdash;an arrangement happily adapted for the escape of the
noxious fumes up the chimney, without that unmerciful "funking"
each other, which a less scientific disposition would have induced. A
small pembroke table filled up the intervening space between them,
sustaining, at each extremity, an elbow and glass of toddy; and thus in
"lonely pensive contemplation" were the two worthies occupied, when
the "iron tongue of midnight had tolled twelve."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ghost-time's come!" said Ingoldsby, taking from his waistcoat
pocket a watch like a gold half-crown, and consulting it as though he
suspected the turret-clock over the stables of mendacity.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush!" said Charles; "did I not hear a footstep?"</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause: there <i>was</i> a footstep&mdash;it sounded
distinctly&mdash;it reached the door&mdash;it hesitated, stopped, and&mdash;passed on.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom darted across the room, threw open the door, and became
aware of Mrs. Botherby toddling to her chamber at the other end of the gallery,
after dosing one of the housemaids with an approved julep from
the Countess of Kent's "Choice Manual."</p>

<p class="indent">"Good night, sir!" said Mrs. Botherby.</p>

<p class="indent">"Go to the d&mdash;l!" said the disappointed ghost-hunter.</p>

<p class="indent">A hour&mdash;two&mdash;rolled on, and still no spectral visitation,
nor did aught intervene to make night hideous; and when the turret-clock
sounded at length the hour of three, Ingoldsby, whose patience and grog
were alike exhausted, sprang from his chair, saying,</p>

<p class="indent">"This is all infernal nonsense, my good fellow. Deuce of
any ghost shall we see to-night; it's long past the canonical hours. I'm off to
bed; and as to your breeches, I'll ensure them for twenty-four hours
at least, at the price of the buckram."</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly. Oh! thankye; to be sure!" stammered Charles,
rousing himself from a reverie, which had degenerated into an absolute snooze.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good night, my boy. Bolt the door behind me;
and defy the Pope, the Devil, and the Pretender!"

<p class="indent">Seaforth followed his friend's advice, and the next morning
came down to breakfast dressed in the habiliments of the preceding day.
The charm was broken, the demon defeated; the light greys with the
red stripe down the seams were yet in <i>rerum naturâ</i>, and adorned
the person of their lawful proprietor.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Tom felicitated himself and his partner of the watch
on the result of their vigilance; but there is a rustic adage, which warns us against
self-gratulation before we are quite "out of the wood."&mdash;Seaforth was
yet within its verge.</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">A rap at Tom Ingoldsby's door the next morning
startled him as he was shaving: he cut his chin.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come in, and be d&mdash;d to you!" said the martyr, pressing
his thumb on the wounded epidermis. The door opened and exhibited Mr. Barney
Maguire. "Well, Barney, what is it?" quoth the sufferer, adopting
the vernacular of his visitant.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Master, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, what does he want?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The loanst of a breeches, plase your honour."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, you don't mean to tell me &mdash;&mdash; By Heaven, this
is too good!" shouted Tom, bursting into a fit of uncontrollable laughter. "Why,
Barney, you don't mean to say the ghost has got them again?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Maguire did not respond to the young squire's
risibility; the cast of his countenance was decidedly serious.</p>

<p class="indent">"Faith, then, it's gone they are, sure enough. Hasn't meself
been looking over the bed, and under the bed, and in the bed, for the
matter of that, and divel a ha'p'orth of breeches is there to the fore
at all: I'm bothered entirely!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Harkye! Mr. Barney," said Tom, incautiously removing his
thumb, and letting a crimson stream "incarnadine the multitudinous"
lather that plastered his throat,&mdash;"this may be all very well with
your master, but you don't humbug me, sir: tell me instantly what
have you done with the clothes?"</p>

<p class="indent">This abrupt transition from "lively to severe" certainly took
Maguire by surprise, and he seemed for an instant as much disconcerted
as it is possible to disconcert an Irish gentleman's gentleman.</p>

<p class="indent">"Me? is it meself, then, that's the ghost to your honour's
thinking?" said he, after a moment's pause, and with a slight shade of indignation
in his tones; "is it I would stale the master's things,&mdash;and
what would I do with them?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That you best know: what your purpose is I can't guess, for I
don't think you mean to 'stale' them, as you call it; but that you are
concerned in their disappearance, I am satisfied. Confound this
blood!&mdash;give me a towel, Barney."</p>

<p class="indent">Maguire acquitted himself of the commission. "As I've a sowl,
your honour," said he solemnly, "little it is meself knows of the matter;
and after what I seen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"What you've seen? Why, what <i>have</i> you seen? Barney,
I don't want to inquire into your flirtations; but don't suppose you can palm
off your saucer eyes and gig-lamps upon me!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Then, as sure as your honour's standing there, I saw him; and
why wouldn't I, when Miss <i>Pauline</i> was to the fore as well as meself,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Get along with your nonsense,&mdash;leave the room, sir!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"But the master?" said Barney imploringly; "and the
breeches?&mdash;sure he'll be catching cowld!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Take that, rascal!" replied Ingoldsby, throwing a pair of
pantaloons at, rather than to, him; "but don't suppose, sir, you shall carry
on your tricks with impunity; recollect there is such a thing as a
tread-mill, and that my father is a county magistrate."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Barney's eye flashed fire,&mdash;he stood erect and
was about to speak; but, mastering himself, not without an effort, he took up the
garment, and left the room as perpendicular as a Quaker.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent space-above1">"Ingoldsby," said Charles Seaforth, after breakfast,
"this is now past a joke; to-day is the last of my stay, for, notwithstanding the
ties which detain me, common decency obliges me to visit home after
so long an absence. I shall come to an immediate explanation with
your father on the subject nearest my heart, and depart while I have
a change of dress left. On his answer will my return depend; in the
mean time tell me candidly,&mdash;I ask it in all seriousness and as a
friend,&mdash;am I not a dupe to your well-known propensity to hoaxing?
have you not a hand in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, by Heaven! Seaforth; I see what you mean: on my honour,
I am as much mystified as yourself; and if your servant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not he: if there be a trick, he at least is not privy to it."</p>

<p class="indent">"If there <i>be</i> a trick? why, Charles, do you think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I know not <i>what</i> to think, Tom. As surely as you are a
living man, so surely did that spectral anatomy visit my room again last night,
grin in my face, and walk away with my trousers; nor was I able to
spring from my bed, or break the chain which seemed to bind me to my pillow."</p>

<p class="indent">"Seaforth," said Ingoldsby, after a short pause, "I will&mdash;
ut hush! here are the girls and my father. I will carry off the females, and
leave you clear field with the Governor: carry your point with him,
and we will talk about your breeches afterwards."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom's diversion was successful: he carried off the ladies <i>en masse</i>
to look at a remarkable specimen of the class <i>Dodecandria Monogynia</i>,
which they could not find; while Seaforth marched boldly up to the
encounter, and carried "the Governor's" outworks by a <i>coup de main</i>.
I shall not stop to describe the progress of the attack; suffice it that it
was as successful as could have been wished, and that Seaforth was
referred back again to the lady. The happy lover was off at a tangent;
the botanical party was soon overtaken; and the arm of Caroline,
whom a vain endeavour to spell out the Linnæan name of a daffy-down-dilly
had detained a little in the rear of the others, was soon
firmly locked in his own.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">"What was the world to them,</span>
<span class="i3">Its noise, its nonsense, and its 'breeches' all?"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Seaforth was in the seventh heaven; he retired to his room
that night as happy as if no such thing as a goblin had ever been heard of,
and personal chattels were as well fenced in by law as real property.
Not so Tom Ingoldsby: the mystery&mdash;for mystery there evidently was,&mdash;had
not only piqued his curiosity, but ruffled his temper. The watch
of the previous night had been unsuccessful, probably because it was
undisguised. Tonight he would "ensconce himself,"&mdash;not indeed "behind
the arras,"&mdash;for the little that remained was, as we have seen, nailed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the wall,&mdash;but in a small closet which opened from one corner of the
room, and, by leaving the door ajar, would give its occupant a view of
all that might pass in the apartment. Here did the young ghost-hunter
take up a position, with a good stout sapling under his arm, a
full half-hour before Seaforth retired for the night. Not even his
friend did he let into his confidence, fully determined that if his plan
did not succeed, the failure should be attributed to himself alone.</p>

<p class="indent">At the usual hour of separation for the night, Tom saw,
from his concealment, the lieutenant enter his room; and, after taking a few
turns in it, with an expression so joyous as to betoken that his thoughts
were mainly occupied by his approaching happiness, proceed slowly to
disrobe himself. The coat, the waistcoat, the black silk stock, were
gradually discarded; the green morocco slippers were kicked off, and
then&mdash;ay, and then&mdash;his countenance grew grave; it seemed to occur
to him all at once that this was his last stake,&mdash;nay, that the very
breeches he had on were not his own,&mdash;that to-morrow morning was
his last, and that if he lost <i>them</i>&mdash;&mdash;A glance showed that
his mind was made up; he replaced the single button he had just subducted,
and threw himself upon the bed in a state of transition, half chrysalis,
half grub.</p>

<p class="indent">Wearily did Tom Ingoldsby watch the sleeper by the flickering
light of the night-lamp, till the clock, striking one, induced him to
increase the narrow opening which he had left for the purpose of observation.
The motion, slight as it was, seemed to attract Charles's attention;
for he raised himself suddenly to a sitting posture, listened for
a moment, and then stood upright upon the floor. Ingoldsby was on
the point of discovering himself, when, the light flashing full upon his
friend's countenance, he perceived that, though his eyes were open,
"their sense was shut,"&mdash;that he was yet under the influence of sleep.
Seaforth advanced slowly to the toilet, lit his candle at the lamp that
stood on it, then, going back to the bed's foot, appeared to search
eagerly for something which he could not find. For a few moments
he seemed restless and uneasy, walking round the apartment and
examining the chairs, till, coming fully in front of a large swing-glass
that flanked the dressing-table, he paused, as if contemplating
his figure in it. He now returned towards the bed, put on his slippers,
and, with cautious and stealthy steps, proceeded towards the
little arched doorway that opened on the private staircase.</p>

<p class="indent">As he drew the bolt, Tom Ingoldsby emerged from his hiding-place;
but the sleep-walker heard him not: he proceeded softly down stairs,
followed at a due distance by his friend, opened the door which led
out upon the gardens, and stood at once among the thickest of the
shrubs, which there clustered round the base of a corner turret, and
screened the postern from common observation. At this moment Ingoldsby
had nearly spoiled all by making a false step: the sound
attracted Seaforth's attention, he paused and turned; and, as the
full moon shed her light direct upon his pale and troubled features,
Tom marked, almost with dismay, the fixed and rayless appearance of
his eyes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"There was no speculation in those orbs</span>
<span class="i3">That he did glare withal,"</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The perfect stillness preserved by his follower seemed to
reassure him; he turned aside, and, from the midst of a thickset laurustinus,
drew forth a gardener's spade, shouldering which he proceeded with
greater rapidity into the midst of the shrubbery. Arrived at a certain
point, where the earth seemed to have been recently disturbed, he
set himself heartily to the task of digging; till, having thrown up
several shovelfuls of mould, he stopped, flung down his tool, and very
composedly began to disencumber himself of his pantaloons.</p>

<p class="indent">Up to this moment Tom had watched him with a wary eye; he now
advanced cautiously, and, as his friend was busily engaged in disentangling
himself from his garment, made himself master of the spade.
Seaforth, meanwhile, had accomplished his purpose; he stood for a
moment with</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6em;">"His streamers waving in the wind,"</p>

<p>occupied in carefully rolling up the small-clothes into as compact a
form as possible, and all heedless of the breath of heaven, which might
certainly be supposed at such a moment, and in such a plight, to "visit
his frame too roughly."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">He was in the act of stooping low to deposit the
pantaloons in the grave which he had been digging for them, when Tom Ingoldsby came
close behind him, and with the flat of the spade&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent space-above1">The shock was effectual; never again was Lieutenant
Seaforth known to act the part of a somnambulist. One by one, his breeches,
his trousers, his pantaloons, his silk-net tights, his patent cords, and
his showy greys with the broad red stripe of the Bombay Fencibles,
were brought to light, rescued from the grave in which they had been
buried, like the straw of a Christmas pie; and, after having been well
aired by Mrs. Botherby, became once again effective.</p>

<p class="indent">The family, the ladies especially, laughed; Barney Maguire
cried "Botheration!" and <i>Ma'mselle Pauline</i>, "<i>Mon Dieu!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">Charles Seaforth, unable to face the quizzing which awaited
him on all sides, started off two hours earlier than he had proposed: he soon
returned, however; and having, at his father-in-law's request, given up
the occupation of Rajah hunting and shooting Nabobs, led his blushing
bride to the altar.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Simpkinson from Bath did not attend the ceremony, being
engaged at the Grand Junction Meeting of <i>Sçavans</i>, then congregating
from all parts of the known world, in the city of Dublin. His essay,
demonstrating that the globe is a great custard, whipped into coagulation
by whirlwinds, and cooked by electricity,&mdash;a little too much
baked in the Isle of Portland, and a thought underdone about the Bog
of Allen,&mdash;is highly spoken of and, it is supposed, will obtain a
Bridgewater prize.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Miss Simpkinson and her sister acted as bridesmaids
on the occasion; the former wrote an <i>epithalamium</i>, and the latter cried
"Lassy me!" at the clergyman's wig. But as of these young ladies, of the fair
widow, Mr. Sucklethumbkin, Mrs. Peters and her P. we may have
more to say hereafter, we take our leave for the present; assuring our
pensive public that Mr. and Mrs. Seaforth are living together quite as
happily as two good-hearted, good-tempered bodies, very fond of each
other, can possibly do; and that since the day of his marriage Charles
has shown no disposition to jump out of bed, or ramble out of doors o'
nights,&mdash;though, from his entire devotion to every wish and whim of
his young wife, Tom insinuates that the fair Caroline does still
occasionally take advantage of it so far as to "slip on the Breeches."

<h2>THE WIDE AWAKE CLUB.</h2>
<p class="f110 space-below1">BY RIGDUM O'FUNNIDOS.</p>

<p class="indent">The clubs of London! I recollect once reading a book so called;
but as for any <i>bonâ fide</i> information touching the <i>soi disant</i>
social assemblies, I might as well have been perusing the Shaster, or reading
the Florentine copy of the Pandects! <i>The</i> clubs of London afford,
as I have reason to know, ample material for the most abundant
fun; but they who expect to find it at Crockford's, the Athenæum,
and other <i>maisons de jeu</i>, where yawning dandies, expert
<i>chevaliers</i>, old men of the town, <i>roués</i> of all sorts,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">Mingle, mingle, mingle,</span>
<span class="i5">As they mingle may,</span>
</div></div>

<p>will be wofully disappointed. The clubs, <i>par excellence</i>, take them
one and all,&mdash;from the Oriental, stuck, with a due disposition and
attention to habits of Eastern indolence, in the dullest corner of the
dullest square in London, down to, or up to, I care not which, the
staring bow-windowed Omnibus Union in Cockspur-street,&mdash;are all
alike destitute of the requisite material. I perhaps may have a
touch at them in the middle of the session and season, when the <i>élite</i>
of the club-men are in town, and when their sayings and doings may
by possibility be worth recording, even if it were only to have a laugh
over them. But, as Copp says, "let that pass for the present." The
clubs that I intend to introduce to the readers of the Miscellany are
certain of those convivial associations composed of the middlemen of
society in the metropolis, who assemble on certain stated nights in
the week to sing songs, smoke pipes, and imbibe moisture in the
shape of divers goes of spirit and pints of ale. My reminiscences
of these assemblies, I think, would fill a goodly tome. To begin with
the last, Hebrew fashion. In was my lot one evening, a short time
since, to be introduced by Mr. Timmins, my landlord, who, seeing I
was rather low-spirited, volunteered the invitation, on a social community
called the "<span class="smcap">Wide Awake Club</span>."</p>

<p class="indent">"Sir," said Mr. Timmins,&mdash;a very worthy knight of the
needle, who called me "the genelman wot lodges in my first floor," (whether up
or down the chimney, deponent sayeth not,)&mdash;"you looks werry
oncomfutable this here nasty evening. Prowisin it ain't takin' of
too great a liberty, and you feel noways disinclined, I think an hour
or two at our club&mdash;(I have the privilege of introducing a wisitor wot
I can answer for in regard to respectability)&mdash;might do you good."</p>

<p class="indent">"And pray, Mr. Timmins, what is the character of your club?"&mdash;"Oh!
sir, the character of our club is <i>on</i>-doubted, sir; we are
all men of experence, sir: no one is admitted a member <i>on</i>less he
shows he is a <i>wide awake</i> cove."</p>

<p class="indent">"What do you mean by a wide awake cove," said I,
"Mr. Timmins?"&mdash;"Vy," said Timmins, "there's no von hellgibble to be a
member on our society but what gets a woucher from a member that
he has a summut to say, and prove wot has made him <i>wide awake</i>,&mdash;that
is to say, more up and down to the ways of the world than the
generality of people, by experence."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"You mean, if I understand you rightly, Mr. Timmins, that
your club is one where a certain number of persons meet to spend the
social hours of relaxation in giving each other the tale of some particular
event or occurrence that has taught them to know there is more
roguery in the world than certain philanthropists would lend us to
believe."&mdash;"You've hit it, sir," said Timmins; "down as a hammer."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Timmins, I shall be happy to join you," I replied.</p>

<p class="indent">During our walk, in answer to certain questions, Timmins
informed me that the president of the club was a Mr. Phiggins, a retired
draper; and that the leading members were Mr. Pounce, a
lawyer's clerk, Mr. Bob Jinks, a butcher, Mr. Shortcut, a tobacconist,
Mr. Sprigs, a fruiterer. "But," said Timmins, "you'll know them
all in five minutes. I don't think this wet evening, there will be a
strong muster: howsomdever, we can console ourselves that, if not
numerous, we are select."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very proper consolation, Timmins," said I.</p>

<p class="indent">When we arrived at the <i>Three Pies</i>, the sign of the
house where the club was held, Timmins went up stairs to communicate the fact
of my being below, and to assure the company that all was regular
and right, as he said; and shortly afterwards I was ushered into the
presence, and introduced to the worthies previously named. The
president, a jolly-looking man about fifty, sat in an elevated chair at
the top of a long table, which gave a goodly display of pipes, glasses
of grog, &amp;c. On each side, the members sat at their most perfect
ease, smoking and chatting. It would appear that they had been at
business some time, for it seemed ebb-tide with the contents of the
glasses; and several worthies were in the act of knocking the ashes
out of their respective pipes. After ordering a glass of punch and
a segar, and another for Timmins, a conversation which was going on
before we came in was resumed, of which the following is a faithful
report.</p>

<p class="indent">"That puts me in mind of M'Flummery," said Pounce, the lawyer's
clerk, putting his hand&mdash;accidentally, I suppose, of course,&mdash;into
Shortcut's open screw of tobacco, and filling his pipe therefrom; "I
mean him as was hung at the Old Bailey some ten years back."</p>

<p class="indent">"And what was he hung for?" asked the president.&mdash;"Why,
not exactly for his good behaviour. He set out in life as heavy a swell
as ever flowed up in the regions of the West End&mdash;carried on the
game for about a dozen years in bang-up style.&mdash;My eye! how precious
drunk he made Snatch'em, the bum, and I, one night as we
pinned him coming home in his cab from the Opera to give a champaign
supper at the Clarendon."</p>

<p class="indent">"Champaign supper?" said the president. "Why, champaign
is a wine; and no man, I maintain, can make a supper off wine, 'coz
wine is drink, and supper, it stands to reason, is eating."</p>

<p class="indent">"And no mistake," said Shortcut.</p>

<p class="indent">"With submission, Mr. Chair," replied Pounce, "I'll
explain. This champaign supper meant a regular slap-up feed; but no one
was allowed any other drink with their grub, but champaign punch
made with green tea in a silver kettle."</p>

<p class="indent">"I pity their stint," said Jinks.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay," said the president, "that stands to reason. But how
did it happen this gentleman came to be hanged?"&mdash;"Why," continued
Pounce, "I was a-coming to that point. As I said just now, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
never was a greater dasher at the West End than this M'Flummery;
but, like many other swells, he was very often lodging in Queer-street
for the want of the ready. One day he came to my old master
Snaps, of the Temple, when I was managing common-law clerk,&mdash;for,
you see, he knew my governor well, seeing that he had issued about
fourteen writs against him. I never shall forget the day he came:
it was a precious wet 'un. He drove up to the gate in a jarvey, and
sent a porter down to our office to know if Snaps was in, without
sending his name. So Snaps sends me to see who it was, and bring
him down. When I got up to the coach, I spied M'Flummery. 'Ah!
my man,' says he, quite familiar, 'how do you like champaign
punch? Here, just pay this fellow his fare,' says he, quite off-hand.
'I've no change about me;' and off he bolts under the gateway, leaving
me to fork out an unknown man. Well! how was I to know what
the Jarvey's fare was? That was a pozer. I wasn't going to ask
him, 'How much?' or where he took up. No! I was too <i>wide awake</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Wide awake!</span>" said the chairman,
and down went a hammer of appropriate brass upon the table three times.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hear! hear! hear!" responded <i>omnes</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">"So I tipped two shillings. 'Vot's this for?' said coachee,
holding it open in his hand, and looking at the money in a way money
ought never by no means to be looked at. 'Your fare from the Clarendon,
Bond-street,' said I, quite stiff and chuff. 'Fare be blowed!'
said he; 'my fare's eight bob.' 'Then you shall swear it and prove
it,' said I, pulling out a handful of silver, taking his number, and
giving the wink to Hobbling Bob, one of the porters, to be witness.
'Take your demand, and we'll meet in Essex-street on Thursday.'
'Well,' says he, 'I ought to have eight bob&mdash;what <i>will</i> you give me?'
'Two,' said I. 'Well,' says he, 'I ain't a going to stand chaffing in
the wet with such a &mdash;&mdash;' and then he abused me in a
way I can't repeat. 'Overcharge and insolence!' said I. 'We'll meet again at
Philippi.' 'Fillip I,' said Jarvey, driving off, 'I should like to fillip
you!' In going back to the office, I thought I ought to charge Mr.
M'Flummery the eight shillings. Taking into consideration that I
had advanced money&mdash;that I had got wet&mdash;had been abused, and
last, though not least, that there was a strong risk touching repayment.
I entered the expenditure thus: 'Coachman's demand, eight
shillings. Paid <i>him</i>.' I said <i>him</i>, not <i>it</i>, you see,
for I was <i>wide awake</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Wide awake!</span>" said the president,
hitting the table three sonorous clinks with the club-hummer of brass, again.</p>

<p class="indent">"When I got back to the office, Snaps called for me through
the pipe to come up stairs:&mdash;he always had me as a witness when he was
<i>doing particular business</i>, such as discounting a bill, bargaining
for a bond, or arranging an annuity.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Sort those papers,' said Snaps, scratching his left ear.</p>

<p class="indent">"That means 'Cock your listeners,' thought I; and I proceeded
to fumble over a bundle of old abstracts as diligently as if I was
hunting for a hundred-pound note.</p>

<p class="indent">"As I turned over the dusty papers, I overheard
the following conversation:</p>

<p class="indent">"'So you can't manage it for me any way?'
said M'Flummery to Snaps.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"'I have not anything at my bankers',' answered Snaps,&mdash;
a lie, for his was the best account of any professional man at Brookes and
Dixon's, and I had that morning paid in five hundred and eighty
pounds eleven and tenpence;)&mdash;'and, by the bye, Pounce, my
confidential man, knows that. Have I, Pounce?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Not anything,' said I; 'I'll be on my oath!'</p>

<p class="indent">"With that M'Flummery said, 'It's cursed hard.&mdash;I
must be at Newmarket on Tuesday, and nothing less than two thousand will do
for me.&mdash;So you cannot get it on my bond or note?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Money is money, and holders are firm,' said Snaps. 'What do
you think of a mortgage? You gave, if I recollect right, six thousand
for the hunting-lodge and the acres in Leicestershire.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Yes!' replied M'Flummery, 'and lost it six months
since in one morning, at Graham's.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'The house in Park Lane?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Belongs to Miss V. the rich old maid.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'The furniture?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Is Gillow's.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Your stud?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'I stalled at Tattersall's for six hundred advance.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Your commission?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Is pounded at Greenwood's for ditto.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Then, in point of fact,' said Snaps, 'Mister,'&mdash;(whenever
Snaps intended to say anything uncivil, he always addressed the favoured
individual as 'Mr.')&mdash;'in point of fact, Mr. M'Flummery, you are a
beggar, possessing neither house, land, goods, or chattels, or property
of any sort, kind, or description.'</p>

<p class="indent">"M'Flummery bit his lips, and walked to the window,
and Snaps continued,</p>

<p class="indent">"'How, after making the avowals you have, Mr. M'Flummery,
you could have the impudence&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p class="indent">"'What do you say, wretch?' cried M'Flummery, rushing and
collaring Snaps, 'Impudence!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Pounce,' cried my master, 'an assault! Call the copying-clerks
up.' But while I was in the act of summoning the scribes down the
pipe, M'Flummery relaxed his hold, and said,</p>

<p class="indent">"'I forgive you, Snaps! It certainly did warrant the term, after
my declarations of insolvency; but it just flashes across my mind,&mdash;how
it could have escaped me I know not,&mdash;that all is not so bad with
me. I have a chest of plate!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'A chest of plate!' ejaculated Snaps.
'Why, my dear sir,&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p class="indent">"'A plate-chest!' said I.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Yes,' continued M'Flummery, 'my splendid sporting service,&mdash;quite
new,&mdash;never used,&mdash;made not six months since by Rundell and
Bridge. How could I have forgotten this!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Sit down, my dear sir,' said Snaps. 'Your recollection of this
<i>com-plete-ly</i> alters the case! Perhaps we <i>can</i> manage the matter.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'But money is money, I am afraid; and holders are firm,
Mr. Snaps,' said M'Flummery, with what I thought the most devilish and
malicious laugh that ever was uttered.</p>

<p class="indent">"'True, true,' replied my master; 'but there is a mode
of tempting even a miser.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'I think there is,' said M'Flummery, just as Old Nick might have
spoken the words, and looking Snaps full in the face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"'Where is the chest?" inquired Snaps. "There is no lien on it?'
he continued gravely. 'It is not at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"'My uncle's? No, no!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Satisfactory so far. What might it have cost you?'&mdash;
'Three thousand pounds.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'And you want <i>two</i>. It is possible, my dear sir, that
the matter <i>can</i> be managed. I'll see about it directly. Call here to-morrow
with the chest, and we'll see what can be done. I'll go into the City
directly.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Then I may as well go with you,' said M'Flummery; 'I will
look in at Rundell's on our way, where you can assure yourself of the fact
and value of the purchase.' So saying, my master and his client
went out."</p>

<p class="indent">"It does not yet seem clear to me," said the president,
interrupting Pounce at this period of his story, "how the gentleman came to
be hung. He seems to have been an honest man, who had more
money than he thought he had."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, he had not," said Pounce; "for, before he went out
of the office, I asked him for the fare of the coach. 'Oh!' said he, quite
cool, 'my little quill-driver, I'll owe you that till to-morrow.'"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," resumed Pounce, after the waiter had been declared
"in the room," had "taken his orders," and gone "out of the room," and
re-entered the room with the said orders <i>executed</i>, preparatory
(paradoxical as it may read) to their being <i>despatched</i>,&mdash;"Well,"
said Pounce, "when Mr. Snaps returned in the afternoon, he said to me,
rubbing his hands, 'Pounce, it's all right! I have seen the chest of
plate. I have handled and examined every article,&mdash;solid and beautiful!
as fine a service as ever was turned out of hand.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Glad to hear it, sir!' says I; 'I had my doubts;'&mdash;throwing as
much of knowingness into my look as befitted a confidential managing
common law-clerk when speaking to his governor.</p>

<p class="indent">"'And so had I,' said Snaps seriously: 'but what do you think,
Pounce?' and my master beckoned me close to him.</p>

<p class="indent">"'What <i>should</i> I think, sir?' said I, deferentially,&mdash;'Why, he not
only bought this most splendid service of plate I ever saw&mdash;massive&mdash;solid;
but&mdash;but&mdash;'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Yes, sir?'&mdash;'But he actually paid for it!' said Snaps;
giving me a playful dig in the ribs with one hand, while he took a huge pinch of
snuff in the other, snapping the dust off his fingers as though so
many crackers were exploding.</p>

<p class="indent">"'I shouldn't have thought he was a good one for paying,
Mr. Snaps,' I replied, thinking of the fare.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Nor I, Pounce,' said Snaps; 'but, hark-ye, be sure you are in
the way to-morrow at three;' and we parted,&mdash;Mr. Snaps being a religious
man, and deacon of Zion Tabernacle in Jehoshaphat Terrace,
to attend lecture, and I to finish a match at bumble-puppy at the
Pig and Tweezers.</p>

<p class="indent">"The very next day, at three, punctual came M'Flummery, and I'm
blessed if it didn't take four porters to carry the chest he brought with
him. (By the way, I may here promiscuously observe, that in the experience
of a long professional life I never knew but one case of unpunctuality
in the attendance of people who had <i>to receive</i> money, and
that was explained by the fact of the party's dying of the cholera
over night.) The chest was duly brought up stairs, and deposited
in a corner of Mr. Snaps' private room."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"'Now, Snaps,' said M'Flummery, 'I hope you are ready with the
needful two thousand upon the nail.'&mdash;'Why, my dear sir,' said my master,
'I have with great difficulty been able to manage <i>one</i> thousand.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Two thousand was the sum agreed for,' said M'Flummery.&mdash;
'True, my dear sir; but money is money.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Ay! and holders are firm, it appears, Snaps; but look at the
security; plate will always fetch a safe and certain sum.'&mdash;'Satisfactory;
truly so, my dear sir. Most unquestionable; but&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Come, we are losing time. In a word, put fifteen hundred
down on the desk, and we close; if not, I'm off to old Lombard.'&mdash;'Say
twelve hundred,' cried Snaps, 'and I'll see what I can do.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Fifteen,' said M'Flummery.&mdash;'It will not leave me a
farthing,' said Snaps; 'and if I do find the odd five hundred, it must be added
to the bond.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Well! add it, and be d&mdash;d to you, Shylock the second!'
said M'Flummery; 'you shall have your bond;' and he burst out into what
I considered an unnecessary loud laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">"The money was counted, and the bond drawn out.</p>

<p class="indent">"'But, now,' said my master, 'if you please, you'll pardon me,
my dear sir; but, in order that there may be no mistake, you will let my
confidential clerk, Pounce, take a view of the contents of the chest.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Most certainly,' said M'Flummery; and, unlocking it, he
desired me to see if the articles corresponded with the inventory.</p>

<p class="indent">"I did so, and found that my master gave an approving look.
After lifting up the several trays, and handling and examining some
four or five articles, M'Flummery, turning to Snaps, said,</p>

<p class="indent">"'Are you satisfied, Mr. Snaps?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Quite so,' said my master.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Then there only remains one thing to satisfy me,' said
M'Flummery, locking the box and padlocks. 'This box will be in your possession
for eighteen months as security; but, as I do not wish to
have <i>my plate hired out</i> or <i>used</i>, you will pardon me,
Mr. Snaps,&mdash;I only say this in order, as you observed, that there may
be 'no mistake,'&mdash;I will put my seal upon the chest, and keep the key!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'The key!' said Snaps; 'my dear sir!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Why,' said M'Flummery, 'what do you want with the key?
You have the power at the end of eighteen months to break open the
chest, and sell the plate, in default of payment; but you have no
power over the plate till then. What, therefore, do <i>you</i> want with
the key?'</p>

<p class="indent">"Snaps was beginning to say something; but M'Flummery stopped
him short by saying, 'It is a bargain, or it is not, Mr. Snaps. I seal
the chest, and keep the key.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Very well,' said Snaps, looking very much like a tiger
that had suddenly lost sight of his dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">"This was accordingly done, the bond signed, and the money
handed over; and M'Flummery shook hands with my master, saying,</p>

<p class="indent">"'Snaps, you are a cunning fellow!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Oh! my dear sir,' said my master, attempting to blush,&mdash;a feat,
by the way, he never accomplished during his life that I know of.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"'But I recollect,' continued M'Flummery, 'an old fisherman
telling me, when I was a boy, that, deep as some fishes were in the
sea, there were always others that swam just as deep. Good-b'ye, old
Shylock! you shall have your bond.' So saying, he left.</p>

<p class="indent">"I confess, this curious remark so astonished me that I
quite forgot at the moment to ask for the fare of the coach. My master
also seemed struck with the observation.</p>

<p class="indent">"'What can he mean?' said Snaps; 'surely there is nothing
wrong? Pooh! pooh! impossible! There is the chest, and possession
is nine points of the law.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'The first of the maxims, sir,' said I."</p>

<p class="indent">Here Pounce paused, filled his pipe, and emptied his tumbler
of grog into that depository where grog had gone in <i>goes</i> for years and years.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well!" said the president, "may I be spiflicated,&mdash;ay, and
exspiflicated,&mdash;if you have not been humbugging us, Pounce, with a pretty
piece of bam! What the deuce has all that you have said to do with
the fact of the gentleman being hanged?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Everything," cried Pounce.</p>

<p class="indent">"I say <i>nothing</i>," said the president.</p>

<p class="indent">"So do I," followed Shortcut.</p>

<p class="indent">"Everything, I maintain," rejoined the lawyer's clerk;
"<i>for</i> six months afterwards his words came true."</p>

<p class="indent">"Whose?" shouted several of the company.</p>

<p class="indent">"M'Flummery's," said Pounce; "he proved himself as deep and
deeper than Snaps. He was a <i>wide awake one</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Wide awake!</span>" said the chairman;
and down went the directing sceptre, with the customary clink.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hear! hear! hear!" resounded through the room.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," continued Pounce; "about six months after, and about
five in the evening, a man came into the office, looking as like a turnkey
or Bow-street runner as any of you gentlemen might ever have
known in your life. He asked to see Mr. Snaps.</p>

<p class="indent">"Just as I was preparing to give my master a hint by one
of the writing-clerks to be on his guard, who should walk into the office
but Snaps himself?</p>

<p class="indent">"'I believe your name is Snaps?' said the
hang-gallows-looking messenger.</p>

<p class="indent">"Snaps was rather near-sighted, and it was getting dark,
so that he did not see the winks and nods of the head I was giving him.</p>

<p class="indent">"'My name <i>is</i> Snaps,' he answered.</p>

<p class="indent">"'You're done,' thought I.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Then you are the person I am to give this letter to,'
says the man.</p>

<p class="indent">"Snaps took the letter,&mdash;and, strange to say, it <i>was</i>
a letter,&mdash;coolly read it, and, folding it up, said, to my great relief, 'Tell the
prisoner I shall attend;' and off went Grimgruffinhoff with his answer.</p>

<p class="indent">"'M'Flummery is in Newgate for passing forged notes;'
said my master, taking a pinch of snuff. 'I thought he would be jugged
some day,' he said, with a half-laugh. 'He wants to see me to-morrow
morning about business of the greatest importance to <i>me</i>.
What can he have to say to <i>me</i>?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Ay, indeed!' said I, 'what sir?'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"'It is as well that I should go,' said my master,
'for there may be something&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p class="indent">"'True,' said I, 'there may be.'</p>

<p class="indent">"The next morning we went to Newgate, which is not the most
pleasant lodging in that neighbourhood, although you have it in the
biggest house, and they charge you nothing for the apartments. When
we entered the prisoner's cell, he was busy writing.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Snaps!' said he, 'I'm glad to see you here!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'I am sorry I cannot return the compliment,' said my master.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Never mind,' said M'Flummery; 'every dog has his day.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'And then he is hanged,' said Snaps, drily,
taking a pinch of snuff.</p>

<p class="indent">"M'Flummery here gave a spasmodic groan, and exclaimed, 'As
little reference to my present condition as possible, Mr. Snaps. It
was not about myself that I requested your visit, but touching matters
in which you alone are interested.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Well, sir; and here I am," said Mr. Snaps. 'To tell you the
truth, I do not feel myself very comfortable in the place, so I shall
feel obliged by your stating the nature of your business with me as
briefly as possible.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'I will,' said the prisoner, with a demonic look. 'You have,
or <i>rather think you have</i>, Mr. Snaps, a chest of plate.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'What!' shrieked my master. 'Is it not silver?
Have you cheated me?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'You have often robbed me, Mr. Snaps,' was the reply;
'I but returned the compliment. That which you believe is silver plate,
manufactured by Rundell and Bridge, was made at Sheffield, and cost
me two hundred pounds.'</p>

<p class="indent">"Snaps groaned, and hid his face.</p>

<p class="indent">"'It is true I did buy a service from those eminent goldsmiths;
but, after the Sheffield firm had copied the pattern, I pledged it with
old Lombard, the pawnbroker. It was redeemed for a day to satisfy
you, Mr. Snaps, and then repledged. The Earl of A. bought the duplicate,
and now has the real property, of which you have the counterfeit
service.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'You are a cursed villain,' said my master; 'and thank Heaven!
you will be hanged!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Only that a felon's cell in Newgate is not the most fit place to
bandy compliments in, I should willingly aspirate the same of you, Snaps!"</p>

<p class="indent">"'And was it to tell me this, you atrocious scoundrel,
that you sent for me?' said my master.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Not exactly,' answered M'Flummery; 'not exactly, Snaps; I
want you to do me a favour.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Was there ever such audacity?' said Snaps. 'Ask me to do
you a favour! You, who have told me to my face that you have
swindled, cheated, plundered, robbed me! A favour! Come Pounce,'
he added, turning to me, 'let us be gone.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Stay!' said the prisoner; 'you have said I shall be hanged!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Ay, as sure as fate!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'My fate is death, I know; but not perhaps by hanging. I have
potent interest at work for me at this moment; and, though sure of
conviction, I may yet get the sentence of death commuted to transportation
for life, and you would not like that would you, Snaps? You
wish me dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"After an inward struggle my master muttered out, 'I do.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Then, Mr. Clerk,' said M'Flummery, in a deep whisper, handing
me secretly a small sealed paper, 'be so good as to open this, when
you get outside these walls, and give it to your master.' Then, aloud
to Snaps, 'My business with you, <i>sir</i>, is finished.' So saying,
he resumed writing; and I led my master, who was trembling with
agitation, revenge, and passion, out of the cell and prison.</p>

<p class="indent">"When we got into a coach, I produced the paper,
and mentioned to my master what M'Flummery had said. With trembling hand he
opened it, and read the following:</p>

<p class="indent">"'Your soul burns with revenge. You wish me dead. It is my
desire also to die. There is a strong probability that I shall not undergo
the last punishment of the law. If you would render my death
certain, and feed your revenge, send me, in a small phial, an ounce
of prussic acid: and the bearer of your welcome gift shall carry
back the fact that M'Flummery the swindler, highwayman, and
forger,&mdash;M'Flummery, who has cheated all through life, has terminated
his career by cheating the law!'</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall never to my dying day forget the face of Snaps when
he read this. He did not say a word; and we sat silent till we got back
to the office. My master went up stairs, saying to me, 'Pounce, be
silent as the grave! and be ready when I call for you.' Shortly afterwards
I heard a loud hammering in his room. 'He's breaking
open the chest,' said I; and true enough he was. Curiosity led me
up stairs; and, on entering the room, there was Snaps, standing
aghast over the open chest, with some broken tea-spoons in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"'The villain has told the truth,' said he. 'The contents of the
chest are not worth fifty pounds. I thought I had taken every precaution;
but I find I was not sufficiently <i>wide awake</i>.'"</p>

<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Wide awake!</span>" said the chairman,
and down went the hammer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hear! hear! hear!" chorused the company.</p>

<p class="indent">"And ever since then, gentlemen," said Pounce, "I have always
had my eyes open when doing a bill, when I had plate, the best of all
possible security."</p>

<p class="indent">"But what became of M'Flummery?" asked Bob Jinks.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay!" said the president, "when was he hanged?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He wasn't hanged at all," replied Pounce.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm blowed," said the chairman, "if I didn't think so, all along."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>How</i> he got it I do not pretend to know," said Pounce,
blowing his nose, and looking aside, "but the very next day after we had paid
him a visit, he was found dead on his bed, with a small empty phial,
that smelt strongly of prussic acid, clenched in his fist."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The clock here stuck twelve, the hour at which
the club disperses according to the rules; so Timmins and I toddled home.

<h2>OLIVER TWIST,</h2>
<p class="f110">OR, <b>THE PARISH BOY'S PROGRESS.</b></p>
<p class="f90">BY BOZ.<br />ILLUSTRATED BY GEORGE CRUIKSHANK.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<h3>CHAPTER THE THIRD</h3>
<p class="f90">RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE,<br />
WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECURE.</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">For a week after the commission of the impious
and profane offence of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in
the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by
the wisdom and mercy of the board. It appears, at first sight,
not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he had entertained a becoming
feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the
white waistcoat, he would have established that sage individual's
prophetic character, once and for ever, by tying one end of his
pocket handkerchief to a hook in the wall, and attaching himself
to the other. To the performance of this feat, however,
there was one obstacle, namely, that pocket handkerchiefs being
decided articles of luxury, had been, for all future times and
ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of
the board in council assembled, solemnly given and pronounced
under their hands and seals. There was a still greater obstacle
in Oliver's youth and childishness. He only cried bitterly all
day; and when the long, dismal night came on, he spread his
little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching
in the corner, tried to sleep, ever and anon waking with a
start and tremble, and drawing himself closer and closer to the
wall, as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in
the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him.</p>

<p class="indent">Let it not be supposed by the enemies of "the system," that,
during the period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied
the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages
of religious consolation. As for exercise, it was nice cold weather,
and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning
under the pump, in a stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble,
who prevented his catching cold, and caused a tingling sensation
to pervade his frame, by repeated applications of the
cane; as for society, he was carried every other day into the
hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a public
warning and example; and, so far from being denied the advantages
of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same
apartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to
listen to, and console his mind with, a general supplication of
the boys, containing a special clause therein inserted by the
authority of the board, in which they entreated to be made
good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded
from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist, whom the supplication
distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection
of the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from
the manufactory of the devil himself.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p class="indent space-above1">It chanced one morning, while Oliver's affairs were
in this auspicious and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweeper,
was wending his way adown the High-street, deeply
cogitating in his mind, his ways and means of paying certain
arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become rather pressing.
Mr. Gamfield's most sanguine calculation of funds could
not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount;
and, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately
cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when, passing the workhouse,
his eyes encountered the bill on the gate.</p>

<p class="indent">"Woo!" said Mr. Gamfield, to the donkey.</p>

<p class="indent">The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction,&mdash;
wondering, probably, whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk
or two, when he had disposed of the two sacks of
soot with which the little cart was laden; so, without noticing
the word of command, he jogged onwards.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the
donkey generally, but more particularly on his eyes; and, running
after him, bestowed a blow on his head which would inevitably
have beaten in any skull but a donkey's; then, catching
hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp wrench, by way of
gentle reminder that he was not his own master: and, having
by these means turned him round, he gave him another blow on
the head, just to stun him till he came back again; and, having
done so, walked up to the gate to read the bill.</p>

<p class="indent">The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing
at the gate with his hands behind him, after having delivered himself
of some profound sentiments in the board-room. Having witnessed
the little dispute between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey,
he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill,
for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was just exactly the sort
of master Oliver Twist wanted. Mr. Gamfield smiled, too, as he
perused the document, for five pounds was just the sum he had
been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was encumbered,
Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse
was, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the
very thing for register stoves. So he spelt the bill through
again, from beginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap
in token of humility, accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.</p>

<p class="indent">"This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to 'prentis,"
said Mr. Gamfield.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, my man," said the gentleman in the white waistcoat,
with a condescending smile, "what of him?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"If the parish vould like him to learn a light, pleasant
trade, in a good 'spectable chimbley-sweepin' bisness," said Mr. Gamfield,
"I wants a 'prentis, and I'm ready to take him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Walk in," said the gentlemen with the white waistcoat.
And Mr. Gamfield having lingered behind, to give the donkey
another blow on the head, and another wrench of the jaw as a
caution not to run away in his absence, followed the gentleman
with the white waistcoat, into the room where Oliver had first
seen him.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's a nasty trade," said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield
had again stated his wish.</p>

<p class="indent">"Young boys have been smothered in chimneys,
before now," said another gentleman.</p>

<p class="indent">"That's acause they damped the straw afore they lit
it in the chimbley to make 'em come down again," said Gamfield;
"that's all smoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain't o' no use at
all in makin' a boy come down; it only sinds him to sleep, and
that's wot he likes. Boys is wery obstinit, and wery lazy,
gen'lm'n, and there's nothink like a good hot blaze to make 'em
come down vith a run; it's humane too, gen'lm'n, acause, even
if they've stuck in the chimbley, roastin' their feet makes 'em
struggle to hextricate theirselves."</p>

<p class="indent">The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very
much amused with this explanation; but his mirth was speedily
checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins. The board then proceeded
to converse among themselves for a few minutes; but in
so low a tone that the words "saving of expenditure," "look
well in the accounts," "have a printed report published," were
alone audible: and they only chanced to be heard on account of
their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis.</p>

<p class="indent">At length the whispering ceased, and the members of the
board having resumed their seats, and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said,</p>

<p class="indent">"We have considered your proposition, and we don't approve of it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not at all," said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.</p>

<p class="indent">"Decidedly not," added the other members.</p>

<p class="indent">As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight
imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death, already,
it occurred to him that the board had perhaps, in some
unaccountable freak, taken it into their heads that this extraneous
circumstance ought to influence their proceedings. It
was very unlike their general mode of doing business, if they
had; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour,
he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from table.</p>

<p class="indent">"So you won't let me have him, gen'lmen," said Mr. Gamfield,
pausing near the door.</p>

<p class="indent">"No," replied Mr. Limbkins; "at least, as it's a
nasty business, we think you ought to take something less than the
premium we offered."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Gamfield's countenance brightened, as, with a quick step
he returned to the table, and said,</p>

<p class="indent">"What'll you give, gen'lmen, however this page
all spelt as shown? Come, don't be too hard on a poor man.
What'll you give?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I should say three pound ten was plenty," said Mr. Limbkins.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ten shillings too much," said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come," said Gamfield; "say four pound, gen'lmen. Say
four pound, and you've got rid of him for good and all. There!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Three pound ten," repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, I'll split the difference, gen'lmen," urged Gamfield.
"Three pound fifteen."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not a farthing more," was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.</p>

<p class="indent">"You're desp'rate hard upon me, gen'lmen," said Gamfield, wavering.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pooh! pooh! nonsense!" said the gentlemen in the white
waistcoat. "He'd be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium.
Take him, you silly fellow! He's just the boy for you. He
wants the stick now and then; it'll do him good; and his
board needn't come very expensive, for he hasn't been overfed
since he was born. Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round
the table, and, observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a
smile himself. The bargain was made, and Mr. Bumble was
at once instructed that Oliver Twist and his indentures were
to be conveyed before the magistrate for signature and approval,
that very afternoon.</p>

<p class="indent">In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to
his excessive astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to
put himself into a clean shirt. He had hardly achieved this
very unusual gymnastic performance, when Mr. Bumble brought
him with his own hands, a basin of gruel, and the holiday allowance
of two ounces and a quarter of bread; at sight of which
Oliver began to cry very piteously, thinking, not unnaturally,
that the board must have determined to kill him for some
useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten him
up in this way.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food,
and be thankful," said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive
pomposity. "You're a-going to be made a 'prentice of, Oliver."</p>

<p class="indent">"A 'prentice, sir!" said the child, trembling.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Oliver," said Mr. Bumble. "The kind and blessed
gentlemen which is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you
have none of your own, are a-going to 'prentice you, and to set
you up in life, and make a man of you, although the expence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
to the parish is three pound ten!&mdash;three pound ten,
Oliver!&mdash;seventy shillin's!&mdash;one hundred and forty
sixpences!&mdash;and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can love."</p>

<p class="indent">As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath after delivering this
address, in an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child's
face, and he sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come," said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously; for it
was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence
had produced. "Come, Oliver, wipe your eyes with the cuffs
of your jacket, and don't cry into your gruel; that's a very
foolish action, Oliver." It certainly was, for there was quite
enough water in it already.</p>

<p class="indent">On their way to the magistrate's, Mr. Bumble instructed
Oliver that all he would have to do, would be to look very
happy, and say, when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to
be apprenticed, that he should like it very much indeed; both
of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey, the more readily
as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in either
particular, there was no telling what would be done to him.
When they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room
by himself and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until
he came back to fetch him.</p>

<p class="indent">There the boy remained with a palpitating heart for
half an hour, at the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his
head, unadorned with the cocked-hat, and said aloud,</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman." As Mr.
Bumble said this, he put on a grim and threatening look, and
added in a low voice, "Mind what I told you, you young rascal."</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble's face at this
somewhat contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented
his offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at
once into an adjoining room, the door of which was open. It
was a large room with a great window; and behind a desk sat
two old gentlemen with powdered heads, one of whom was reading
the newspaper, while the other was perusing, with the aid of
a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of parchment
which lay before him. Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of
the desk, on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially washed
face, on the other; while two or three bluff-looking men in top-boots
were lounging about.</p>

<p class="indent">The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off,
over the little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause
after Oliver had been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.</p>

<p class="indent">"This is the boy, your worship," said Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p>The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his
head for a moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the
sleeve, whereupon the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, is this the boy?" said the old gentleman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"This is him, sir," replied Mr. Bumble. "Bow to the magistrate, my dear."</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance.
He had been wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates' powder,
whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their
heads, and were boards from thenceforth, on that account.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," said the old gentleman,
"I suppose he's fond of chimney-sweeping?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He dotes on it, your worship," replied Bumble, giving
Oliver a sly pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn't.</p>

<p class="indent">"And he <i>will</i> be a sweep, will he?"
inquired the old gentleman.</p>

<p class="indent">"If we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he'd
run away simultaneously, your worship," replied Bumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"And this man that's to be his master,&mdash;you, sir,&mdash;you'll
treat him well, and feed him, and do all that sort of thing,&mdash;will
you?" said the old gentleman.</p>

<p class="indent">"When I says I will, I means I will," replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly.</p>

<p class="indent">"You're a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest,
open-hearted man," said the old gentleman, turning his spectacles
in the direction of the candidate for Oliver's premium,
whose villanous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for
cruelty. But the magistrate was half blind, and half childish,
so he couldn't reasonably be expected to discern what other people did.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope I am, sir," said Mr. Gamfield with an ugly leer.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have no doubt you are, my friend," replied the old
gentleman, fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking
about him for the inkstand.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the critical moment of Oliver's fate. If the
inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was, he would
have dipped his pen into it and signed the indentures, and Oliver
would have been straightway hurried off. But, as it chanced to
be immediately under his nose, it followed as a matter of course
that he looked all over his desk for it, without finding it; and
happening in the course of his search to look straight before
him, his encountered the pale and terrified face of Oliver
Twist, who, despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of
Bumble, was regarding the very repulsive countenance of his
future master with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too
palpable to be mistaken even by a half-blind magistrate.</p>

<p class="indent">The old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and
looked from Oliver to Mr. Limbkins, who attempted to take snuff with
a cheerful and unconcerned aspect.</p>

<p class="indent">"My boy," said the old gentleman, leaning over the desk.
Oliver started at the sound,&mdash;he might be excused for doing so,
for the words were kindly said, and strange sounds frighten one.
He trembled violently, and burst into tears.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"My boy," said the old gentleman, "you look pale and
alarmed. What is the matter?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Stand a little away from him, beadle," said the other
magistrate, laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression
of some interest. "Now, boy, tell us what's the matter: don't be afraid."</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver fell on his knees, and, clasping his hands together,
prayed that they would order him back to the dark room,&mdash;that
they would starve him&mdash;beat him&mdash;kill him if they pleased&mdash;rather
than send him away, with that dreadful man.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well!" said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with
most impressive solemnity,&mdash;"Well! of <i>all</i> the artful and designing
orphans that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hold your tongue, beadle," said the second old gentleman,
when Mr. Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective.</p>

<p class="indent">"I beg your worship's pardon," said Mr. Bumble, incredulous
of his having heard aright,&mdash;"did your worship speak to me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes&mdash;hold your tongue."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Bumble was stupified with astonishment. A beadle ordered
to hold his tongue! A moral revolution.</p>

<p class="indent">The old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his
companion: he nodded significantly.</p>

<p class="indent">"We refuse to sanction these indentures," said the old gentleman,
tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope," stammered Mr. Limbkins,&mdash;"I hope the
magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been
guilty of any improper conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a mere child."</p>

<p class="indent">"The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce
any opinion on the matter," said the second old gentleman sharply.
"Take the boy back to the workhouse, and treat him kindly.
He seems to want it."</p>

<p class="indent">That same evening the gentleman in the white waistcoat
most positively and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be
hung, but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain.
Mr. Bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery, and
said he wished he might come to good; to which Mr. Gamfield
replied, that he wished he might come to him, which, although
he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem to be a
wish of a totally opposite description.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The next morning the public were once more
informed that Oliver Twist was again to let, and that five pounds would be
paid to anybody who would take possession of him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>CHAPTER THE FOURTH.</h3>
<p class="f90">OLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE,<br />
MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFE.</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">In great families, when an advantageous place
cannot be obtained, either in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy,
for the young man who is growing up, it is a very general custom
to send him to sea. The board, in imitation of so wise and
salutary an example, took counsel together on the expediency of
shipping off Oliver Twist in some small trading vessel bound to
a good unhealthy port, which suggested itself as the very best
thing that could possibly be done with him; the probability
being, that the skipper would either flog him to death, in a playful
mood, some day after dinner, or knock his brains out with an
iron bar,&mdash;both pastimes being, as is pretty generally known,
very favourite and common recreations among gentlemen of that
class. The more the case presented itself to the board, in this
point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared;
so they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing
for Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary
inquiries, with the view of finding out some captain or other who
wanted a cabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to
the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission, when he
encountered just at the gate no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry,
the parochial undertaker.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Sowerberry was a tall, gaunt, large-jointed man,
attired in a suit of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of
the same colour, and shoes to answer. His features were not
naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect, but he was in general
rather given to professional jocosity; his step was elastic,
and his face betokened inward pleasantry, as he advanced to Mr.
Bumble and shook him cordially by the hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have taken the measure of the two women that died last
night, Mr. Bumble," said the undertaker.</p>

<p class="indent">"You'll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry," said the
beadle, as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered
snuff-box of the undertaker, which was an ingenious little model
of a patent coffin. "I say you'll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,"
repeated Mr. Bumble, tapping the undertaker on the
shoulder in a friendly manner, with his cane.</p>

<p class="indent">"Think so?" the undertaker in a tone which half
admitted and half disputed the probability of the event. "The
prices allowed by the board are very small, Mr. Bumble."</p>

<p class="indent">"So are the coffins," replied the beadle, with precisely
as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this, as of course
he ought to be, and laughed a long time without cessation, "Well,
well, Mr. Bumble," he said at length, "there's no denying that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
since the new system of feeding has come in, the coffins are
something narrower and more shallow than they used to be; but
we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble. Well-seasoned timber
is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron bundles come by
canal from Birmingham."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, well," said Mr. Bumble, "every trade has its
drawbacks, and a fair profit is of course allowable."</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course, of course," replied the undertaker; "and
if I don't get a profit upon this or that particular article, why, I
make it up in the long run, you see&mdash;he! he! he!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Just so," said Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"Though I must say,"&mdash;continued the undertaker, resuming
the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted,&mdash;"though
I must say, Mr. Bumble, that I have to contend
against one very great disadvantage, which is, that all the stout
people go off the quickest&mdash;I mean that the people who have
been better off; and have paid rates for many years, are the first
to sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr.
Bumble, that three or four inches over one's calculation makes a
great hole in one's profits, especially when one has a family to
provide for, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation
of an ill-used man, and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to
convey a reflection on the honour of the parish, the latter gentleman
thought it advisable to change the subject; and Oliver
Twist being uppermost in his mind, he made him his theme.</p>

<p class="indent">"By the bye," said Mr. Bumble, "you don't know anybody
who wants a boy, do you&mdash;a porochial 'prentis, who is at present
a dead-weight,&mdash;a millstone, as I may say&mdash;round the porochial
throat? Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry&mdash;liberal terms;"&mdash;and,
as Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his cane to the bill above him,
and gave three distinct raps upon the words "five pounds,"
which were printed therein in Roman capitals of gigantic size.</p>

<p class="indent">"Gadso!" said the undertaker, taking Mr. Bumble by the
gilt-edged lappel of his official coat; "that's just the very thing
I wanted to speak to you about. You know&mdash;dear me, what a
very elegant button this is, Mr. Bumble; I never noticed it before."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I think it is rather pretty," said the beadle,
glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished
his coat. "The die is the same as the parochial seal,&mdash;the Good
Samaritan healing the sick and bruised man. The board presented
it to me on New-year's morning, Mr. Sowerberry. I put
it on, I remember, for the first time, to attend the inquest on
that reduced tradesman who died in a doorway at midnight."</p>

<p class="indent">"I recollect," said the undertaker. "The jury brought in
'Died from exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries
of life,'&mdash;didn't they?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Bumble nodded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"And they made it a special verdict, I think," said
the undertaker, "by adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving
officer had&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Tush&mdash;foolery!" interposed the beadle angrily.
"If the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk,
they'd have enough to do."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very true," said the undertaker; "they would indeed."</p>

<p class="indent">"Juries," said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was
his wont when working into a passion,&mdash;"juries is ineddicated,
vulgar, grovelling wretches."</p>

<p class="indent">"So they are," said the undertaker.</p>

<p class="indent">"They haven't no more philosophy or political economy
about 'em than that," said the beadle, snapping his fingers contemptuously.</p>

<p class="indent">"No more they have," acquiesced the undertaker.</p>

<p class="indent">"I despise 'em," said the beadle, growing very red in the face.</p>

<p class="indent">"So do I," rejoined the undertaker.</p>

<p class="indent">"And I only wish we'd a jury of the independent sort
in the house for a week or two," said the beadle; "the rules and
regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down
for them."</p>

<p class="indent">"Let 'em alone for that," replied the undertaker. So saying,
he smiled approvingly to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Bumble lifted off his cocked-hat, took a handkerchief
from the inside of the crown, wiped from his forehead the perspiration
which his rage had engendered, fixed the cocked-hat
on again; and, turning to the undertaker, said in a calmer voice,</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, what about the boy?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!" replied the undertaker; "why, you know, Mr. Bumble,
I pay a good deal towards the poor's rates."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hem!" said Mr. Bumble. "Well?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," replied the undertaker, "I was thinking that if I
pay so much towards 'em, I've a right to get as much out of
'em as I can, Mr. Bumble; and so&mdash;and so&mdash;I think I'll take the boy myself."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and
led him into the building. Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the
board for five minutes, and then it was arranged that Oliver
should go to him that evening "upon liking,"&mdash;a phrase which
means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that if the master find,
upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out of a boy
without putting too much food in him, he shall have him for a
term of years, to do what he likes with.</p>

<p class="indent">When little Oliver was taken before "the gentlemen" that
evening, and informed that he was to go that night as general
house-lad to a coffin-maker's, and that if he complained of his
situation, or ever came back to the parish again, he would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
sent to sea, there to be drowned, or knocked on the head, as the
case might be, he evinced so little emotion, that they by common
consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal, and
ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, although it was very natural that the board, of all
people in the world, should feel in a great state of virtuous
astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on
the part of anybody, they were rather out, in this particular instance.
The simple fact was, that Oliver, instead of possessing
too little feeling, possessed rather too much, and was in a fair
way of being reduced to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness
for life, by the ill usage he had received. He heard the
news of his destination in perfect silence, and, having had his
luggage put into his hand,&mdash;which was not very difficult to
carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a
brown paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches
deep,&mdash;he pulled his cap over his eyes, and once more attaching
himself to Mr. Bumble's coat cuff, was led away by that dignitary
to a new scene of suffering.</p>

<p class="indent">For some time Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without
notice or remark, for the beadle carried his head very erect, as a
beadle always should; and, it being a windy day, little Oliver
was completely enshrouded by the skirts of Mr. Bumble's coat
as they blew open, and disclosed to great advantage his flapped
waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches. As they drew near to
their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it expedient to
look down and see that the boy was in good order for inspection
by his new master, which he accordingly did, with a fit
and becoming air of gracious patronage.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oliver!" said Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir," replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Pull that cap off of your eyes, and hold up your head, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">Although Oliver did as he was desired at once, and passed
the back of his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left
a tear in them when he looked up at his conductor. As Mr.
Bumble gazed sternly upon him, it rolled down his cheek. It
was followed by another, and another. The child made a strong
effort, but it was an unsuccessful one; and, withdrawing his
other hand from Mr. Bumble's, he covered his face with both,
and wept till the tears sprung out from between his thin and bony fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well!" exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting
at his little charge a look of intense malignity,&mdash;"well, of <i>all</i>
the ungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver,
you are the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no, sir," sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand
which held the well-known cane; "no, no, sir; I will be good indeed;
indeed, indeed, I will, sir! I am a very little boy, sir; and it is
so&mdash;so&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"So what?" inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">"So lonely, sir&mdash;so very lonely," cried the child.
"Everybody hates me. Oh! sir, don't be cross to me. I feel as if I
had been cut here, sir, and it was all bleeding away;" and the
child beat his hand upon his heart, and looked into his companion's
face with tears of real agony.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver's piteous and helpless
look with some astonishment for a few seconds, hemmed three or four
times in a husky manner, and, after muttering something about
"that troublesome cough," bid Oliver dry his eyes and be a
good boy; and, once more taking his hand, walked on with him in silence.</p>

<p class="indent">The undertaker had just put up the shutters of his
shop, and was making some entries in his day-book by the light of a most
appropriately dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.</p>

<p class="indent">"Aha!" said the undertaker, looking up from the book,
and pausing in the middle of a word; "is that you, Bumble?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No one else, Mr. Sowerberry," replied the beadle. "Here,
I've brought the boy." Oliver made a bow.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! that's the boy, is it?" said the undertaker,
raising the candle above his head to get a full glimpse of Oliver. "Mrs.
Sowerberry! will you come here a moment, my dear?"</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind
the shop, and presented the form of a short, thin, squeezed-up woman,
with a vixenish countenance.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear," said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, "this is the
boy from the workhouse that I told you of." Oliver bowed again.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear me!" said the undertaker's wife, "he's very small."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, he <i>is</i> rather small," replied Mr. Bumble, looking at
Oliver as if it were his fault that he wasn't bigger; "he is
small,&mdash;there's no denying it. But he'll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry,&mdash;he'll grow."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! I dare say he will," replied the lady pettishly, "on
our victuals, and our drink. I see no saving in parish children,
not I; for they always cost more to keep, than they're worth:
however, men always think they know best. There, get down
stairs, little bag o' bones." With this, the undertaker's wife
opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down a steep flight of
stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark, forming the ante-room to
the coal-cellar, and denominated "the kitchen," wherein sat a
slatternly girl in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings
very much out of repair.</p>

<p class="indent">"Here, Charlotte," said Mrs. Sowerberry, who had followed
Oliver down, "give this boy some of the cold bits that were put
by for Trip: he hasn't come home since the morning, so he
may go without 'em. I dare say he isn't too dainty to eat
'em,&mdash;are you, boy?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and
who was trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative;
and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him.</p>

<p class="indent">I wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink
turn to gall within him, whose blood is ice, and whose heart
is iron, could have seen Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty
viands that the dog had neglected, and witnessed the horrible
avidity with which he tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity
of famine:&mdash;there is only one thing I should like better; and
that would be to see him making the same sort of meal himself with the same relish.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," said the undertaker's wife, when Oliver had
finished his supper, which she had regarded in silent horror, and with
fearful auguries of his future appetite, "have you done?"</p>

<p class="indent">There being nothing eatable within his reach,
Oliver replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then come with me," said Mrs. Sowerberry, taking
up a dim and dirty lamp, and leading the way up stairs; "your
bed's under the counter. You won't mind sleeping among the
coffins, I suppose?&mdash;but it doesn't much matter whether you
will or not, for you won't sleep any where else. Come; don't
keep me here, all night."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Oliver lingered no longer,
but meekly followed his new mistress.</p>

<h2>A PASSAGE IN THE LIFE OF BEAUMARCHAIS.</h2>
<p class="f110">BY GEORGE HOGARTH.</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">M. de Beaumarchais, the celebrated French dramatist,
was one of the most remarkable men of his time, though his fame now rests
in a great measure on his two comedies, <i>Le Barbier de Seville</i>, and
<i>Le Mariage de Figaro</i>; and even these titles are now-a-days much
more generally associated with the names of Rossini and Mozart,
than with that of Beaumarchais. Few comedies, however, have been
more popular on the French stage than these delightful productions.
The character of Susanna was the <i>chef d'&oelig;re</i> of the fascinating
Mademoiselle Contat; and has preserved its attractions, almost down
to the present time, in the hands of her evergreen successor, the
inimitable Mars. The Count and Countess Almaviva, Susanna,
Figaro, and Cherubino, have now become the property of Italian
singers; and, in this musical age, even the French public have been
content to give up the wit, satire, point, and playfulness of the original
comedies, for those meagre outlines which have been made the
vehicles for the most charming dramatic music in the world. Not
that <i>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</i> and <i>Le Nozze di Figaro</i> are not lively
and amusing, considered as operas; but the <i>vis comica</i> of Beaumarchais
has almost entirely evaporated in the process of transmutation.</p>

<p class="indent">None of the other dramatic works of Beaumarchais are
comparable to these. Some of them bear marks of immature genius; and his
last play, <i>La Mère Coupable</i>, the conclusion of the history of the
Almaviva family, was written after a long interval, and when advanced
age, and a life of cares and troubles, appear to have extinguished
the author's gaiety, and changed the tone of his feelings.
The play is written with power, but it is gloomy, and even tragical;
succeeding its lively and brilliant precursors as a sunset of clouds
and darkness closes a bright and smiling day. It painfully disturbs
the agreeable associations produced by the names of its characters;
and, for the sake of these associations, every one who reads it must
wish to forget it.</p>

<p class="indent">But it is not so much to the writings of Beaumarchais, as
to himself, that we wish at present to direct the attention of our readers.
His life was anything but that of a man of letters. He possessed
extraordinary talents for affairs; and, during his whole life, was deeply
engaged in important pursuits both of a private and public nature.
Extensive commercial enterprises, lawsuits of singular complication,
and missions of great moment as a political agent, withdrew him
from the walks of literature, and probably prevented him (as one of
his biographers has remarked) from enriching the French stage with
twenty dramatic masterpieces, instead of two or three. In this
respect he resembled our Sheridan, as well as in the character of his
genius; for we know of no plays that are more akin to each other,
in many remarkable features, than <i>The School for Scandal</i>
and <i>Le Mariage de Figaro</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">It is a remarkable circumstance in the history of Beaumarchais,
that a considerable portion of his literary fame was derived from a
species of composition from which anything of the kind could hardly
have been expected,&mdash;the pleadings, or law-papers, in the various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
causes in which he was involved. The proceedings in the French
parliaments, or high courts of justice, were totally different from
those with which we are acquainted in England; though they were
similar to those which were practised in the Scottish court of session,
(a tribunal formed on the French model,) before that court came in
for its share in the general progress of reform. There were no juries;
the proceedings were conducted under the direction of a single
judge, whose business it was to prepare the cause for decision, and
then to make a report upon it to the whole court, by whom the judgment
was given. A favourable view of the case from the reporting
judge was, of course, an object of much importance; and the most
urgent solicitations by the litigants and their friends&mdash;nay, even
bribes&mdash;were often employed to obtain it. A charge against
Beaumarchais,&mdash;a groundless one, however,&mdash;of having attempted to
bribe the wife of one of these judges, exposed him to a long and violent
persecution. Among his enemies were men of rank and power; the
grossest calumnies against him were circulated in the highest quarters,
and countenanced by the court in which he was a litigant; the
bar became afraid to support him, and he could no longer find an
advocate. In these forlorn circumstances the energy of his character
did not abandon him, and he resolved to become his own advocate.</p>

<p class="indent">The pleadings in the French courts of those days were all
written. The cause was debated in <i>mémoires</i>, or memorials, in which the
pleas of the parties were stated without any of our technical formality.
Law, logic, eloquence, pathos, and sarcasm, were all employed, in
whatever way the pleader thought most advantageous. The paper
was printed and distributed, not only among the judges, but among
the friends and connexions of the parties; and when the case excited
much interest, the distribution was often so extensive as almost to
amount to publication. Beaumarchais, deserted by his former advocates,
began to compose his own memorials, to which he found means
to obtain the mere signature of some member of the bar. In this
manner he fought a long and desperate battle, in which, after some
severe reverses, (one of which was the burning of a series of his
memorials by the common hangman, pursuant to a sentence of the
court,) he at length achieved a complete and signal victory over all
his enemies, whom he not only defeated on the immediate subjects of
dispute, but overwhelmed with universal ridicule and contempt.</p>

<p class="indent">In the mean time these <i>mémoires</i> produced an
extraordinary sensation throughout France. When a new one appeared, it flew
from hand to hand like lightning. The causes in which Beaumarchais was
involved were so interesting in themselves, and connected with such
strange occurrences, that, had they belonged to the period of the
<i>Causes Célèbres</i>, they would have made a remarkable figure in that
famous collection. Their interest was increased a thousand-fold by
the memorials of Beaumarchais. "The genius," says a French writer,
"with which they are marked, the originality of the style, the dramatic
form of the narrative, mingled with fine bursts of eloquence,
keep the attention always awake; while the logical clearness of the
reasoning, and the art of accompanying every statement of facts with
striking and conclusive evidence, lay hold of the mind, and interest
and instruct, without fatiguing the reader. But their most remarkable
feature is the noble firmness of mind which they display; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
serenity of a lofty spirit which the most terrible and unforeseen
reverses were unable to subdue or intimidate; the stamp, in short,
of a great character which is impressed upon them." These writings
of Beaumarchais are spoken of in terms of admiration by the most
eminent literati of that day, especially by Voltaire, in many parts of
his correspondence; they attracted the notice of the government,
and procured for their author several political missions, the results of
which had no small influence on the public affairs of the time.</p>

<p class="indent">We have given this sketch of the character of Beaumarchais
by way of introduction to an account of a remarkable incident of his life,
taken from one of those extraordinary productions. Among other
calumnies, he had been charged, at one time with a series of atrocities
committed in Spain ten years before; and, among other things, with
having endeavoured to bully a Spanish gentleman into a marriage with
his sister, whom that gentleman had kept as a mistress; and it was
added that he had been expelled from Spain in disgrace. In one of
his <i>mémoires</i> he answers these accusations, by giving a narrative of
his residence in Spain during the period in question. It is a leaf of
"the romance of real life," and the interest of the story is heightened
by the conviction of its entire truth; for every fact is confirmed by
evidence, and the smallest incorrectness, as the writer knew, would
be laid hold of by his enemies. Goethe, it is not immaterial to add,
has made it the subject of his tragedy of <i>Clavijo</i>, the characters
of which consist of Beaumarchais himself, and the other persons
introduced into his narrative; though the great German dramatist has
taken some poetical liberties with the story, especially in its
tragical catastrophe.</p>

<p class="indent">The following narrative is a <i>condensation</i> of the original,
which contains minute details and pieces of evidence, of great importance to
M. de Beaumarchais' object at the time,&mdash;a conclusive vindication of
his character, but not at all conducive to the interest of the story.</p>

<p class="indent">"For some years I had enjoyed the happiness of living
in the bosom of my family; and our domestic union consoled me for all I
suffered through the malice of my enemies. I had five sisters. Two
of them had been committed by my father, at a very early age, to the
care of one of his correspondents in Spain, so that I had only that
faint but pleasant remembrance of them which is associated with our
days of childhood. This remembrance, however, was kept alive by
frequent correspondence.</p>

<p class="indent">"In February 1764, my father received from his eldest
daughter a letter of very painful import. 'My sister,' she wrote, 'has
been grossly abused by a powerful and dangerous man. Twice, when on
the point of marrying her, he has broken his word, and withdrawn
without condescending to assign any reason for his conduct; and my
poor sister's wounded feelings have thrown her into a state of depression
from which we have faint hopes of her recovery. For these six
days she has not spoken a word. Under this unmerited stigma, we
are living in the deepest retirement. I weep night and day, and
endeavour to offer the unhappy girl comfort which I cannot find myself.'</p>

<p class="indent">"My father put his daughter's letter into my hands, 'Try,
my son,' he said, 'what you can do for these poor girls. They are your
sisters as well as the others.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"'Alas, my dear father,' I said, 'what can I do for
them? What assistance shall I ask? Who knows but they may have brought this
disgrace upon themselves by some fault of their own?'</p>

<p class="indent">"My father showed me some letters from our ambassador to
my elder sister, in which he spoke of both of them in terms of the highest
esteem. I read these letters. They gave me courage; and my father's
phrase, 'They are your sisters as well as the others,' had sunk
into my heart. 'Console yourself,' I said to him, 'I am going to
adopt a course that may surprise you; but it appears to me the
surest and the most prudent. My eldest sister mentions several
respectable persons in Paris who can give testimony to the good
conduct and virtue of her sister. I will see them; and if their testimony
is as honourable as that of our ambassador, I shall instantly set
out for Madrid, and either punish the traitor who has outraged them,
or bring them back with me to share my humble fortune.'</p>

<p class="indent">"My inquiries were completely satisfactory. I immediately returned
to Versailles, and informed my august patronesses,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
that business, no less painful than urgent, demanded my immediate presence
at Madrid. I showed them my sister's letter, and received
their permission to depart, in terms of the kindest encouragement.
My preparations were soon made, as I dreaded that I might not
arrive in time to save my poor sister's life. I obtained the strongest
letters of recommendation to our ambassador at Madrid; and my
ancient friend, M. Duvernay, gave me a credit on himself to the
amount of two hundred thousand francs, to enable me to transact a
piece of commercial business, and at the same time to increase my
personal consideration. I was accompanied by one of my friends, a
merchant, who had some business in Spain; but who went also partly
on my account.</p>

<p class="indent">"We travelled day and night, and arrived in Madrid on the
18th of May 1764. I had been expected for some days, and found my sisters
in the midst of their friends. As soon as the feelings, caused by a
meeting between a brother and his sisters, so long separated, and
seeing each other once more under such circumstances, had subsided,
I earnestly conjured them to give me an exact account of all that
had happened, in order that I might be able to serve them effectually.
The story was long and minute. When I had heard it to an end,
I embraced my young sister:</p>

<p class="indent">"'Now that know all, my dear girl,' I said, 'keep your
mind at ease. I am delighted to see that you no longer love this man, and
my part is all the easier on that account. All that I want now, is to
know where I can find him.'</p>

<p class="indent">"Our friends began eagerly to advise me to go, first of all,
to Aranjuez, and wait upon the French ambassador, in order to obtain his
protection against a man whose official situation gave him so much
influence with people in power. But I had made up my mind to
follow a different course; and, without giving any intimation of my
intention, I merely begged that my arrival might be kept a secret till
my return from Aranjuez.</p>

<p class="indent">"I immediately changed my travelling dress, and found my
way to the residence of Don Joseph Clavijo, keeper of the archives of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
crown. He was from home, but I went in search of him; and it was
in the drawing-room of a lady whom he had gone to visit that I told
him, that, having just arrived from France, and being intrusted with
some commissions for him, I was anxious to have an interview with
him as soon as possible. He asked me to breakfast the following
morning; and I accepted the invitation for myself and the French
merchant who was along with me.</p>

<p class="indent">"Next morning, I was with him at half-past eight o'clock.
I found him in a splendid house, which, he said, belonged to Don Antonio
Portugues, the highly-respected head of one of the government offices,
and so much his friend, that in his absence he used the house as if it
were his own.</p>

<p class="indent">"'I am commissioned, sir,' I began, 'by a society of men
of letters, to establish, in the different towns which I visit, a literary
correspondence with the most distinguished men of the place; and I am
sure that I cannot serve my friends more effectually than by opening
a correspondence between them and the distinguished author of the
papers published under the title of the '<i>Pensador</i>'.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">"He seemed delighted with the proposal. That I might the
better know my man, I allowed him to expatiate on the advantages which
different countries might derive from this kind of literary intercourse.
His manner became quite affectionate; he talked like on oracle; and
was all smiles and self-satisfaction. At last he bethought himself of
asking what business of my own had brought me to Spain, politely
expressing his wish to be of service to me.</p>

<p class="indent">"'I accept,' I said, 'your kind offers with much gratitude,
and assure you, sir, that I shall explain my business very openly.'</p>

<p class="indent">"With the view of throwing him into a state of perplexity in
which I intended him to remain till it should be cleared up by the
conclusion of what I had to say, I again introduced my friend to him,
telling him that the gentleman was not unacquainted with the matter,
and that his presence would do no harm. At this exordium, Clavijo
turned his eyes on my friend with an air of curiosity. I began:</p>

<p class="indent">"'A French merchant, who had a numerous family and a
narrow fortune, had several correspondents in Spain. One of the richest
of them, happening to be at Paris nine or ten years ago, proposed to
adopt two of his daughters. He would take them, he said, to Madrid;
he was an old bachelor; they should be to him as children,
and be the comfort of his old age; and after his death they should
succeed to his mercantile establishment. The two eldest daughters
were committed to his care. Two years afterwards he died, leaving
the Frenchwomen without any other advantage than the burden of
carrying on an embarrassed commercial house. Their good conduct,
however, and amiable qualities, gained them many friends, who
exerted themselves to increase their credit and improve
their circumstances.'</p>

<p class="indent">"I observed Clavijo become very attentive.</p>

<p class="indent">"'About this time, a young man, a native of the Canaries,
got an introduction to their house.'</p>

<p class="indent">"Clavijo's gaiety of countenance vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Anxious to make himself known, this young gentleman
conceived the idea of giving Madrid a pleasure of a novel description in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Spain, by establishing a periodical paper in the style of the English
<i>Spectator</i>. He received encouragement and assistance, and nobody
doubted that his undertaking would be fully successful. It was then
that, animated by the hope of reputation and fortune, he made a proposal
of marriage to the younger of the French ladies. The elder
told him, that he should first endeavour to succeed in the world; and
that as soon as some regular employment, or other means of honourable
subsistence, should give him a right to think of her sister, her
consent, if he gained her sister's affections, should not be wanting.'</p>

<p class="indent">"He became restless and agitated. Without seeming to
notice his manner, I went on.</p>

<p class="indent">"'The younger sister, touched by her admirer's merit,
refused several advantageous proposals; and, preferring to wait till he who
had loved her, for four years, should realise the hopes which he and
his friends entertained, encouraged him to publish the first number
of his journal under the imposing title of the <i>Pensador</i>.'</p>

<p class="indent">"Clavijo looked as if he were going to faint.</p>

<p class="indent">"'The work,' I continued with the utmost coldness, 'had
a prodigious success. The king, delighted with so charming a production,
gave the author public marks of favour; and he was promised
the first honourable employment that should be vacant. He then
removed, by an open prosecution of his suit, every other person who
had sought my sister's hand. The marriage was delayed only till
the promised post should be obtained. At six months' end the post
made its appearance, but the man vanished.'</p>

<p class="indent">"Here my listener heaved an involuntary sigh, and, perceiving
what he had done, reddened with confusion. I went on without interruption.</p>

<p class="indent">"'The matter had gone too far to be allowed to drop in
this manner. A suitable house had been taken; the bans had been published.
The common friends of the parties were indignant at such an
outrage; the ambassador of France interfered; and when this man
saw that the French ladies had protectors whose influence might be
greater than his own, and might even destroy his opening prospects,
he returned to throw himself at the feet of his offended mistress.
He got her friends to intercede for him; and as the anger of a forsaken
woman has generally love at the bottom, a reconciliation soon
took place. The marriage preparations were resumed; the bans
were re-published; the ceremony was to take place in three days.
The reconciliation had made as much noise as the rupture. The
lover set out for St. Ildefonso to ask the minister's consent to his
marriage; entreating his friends to preserve for him till his return the
now precarious affection of his mistress, and to arrange everything for
the immediate performance of the ceremony.'</p>

<p class="indent">"In the horrible state into which he was thrown by this
recital, but yet uncertain whether I might not be telling a story in which I
had no personal interest, Clavijo from time to time fixed his eyes on
my friend, whose <i>sangfroid</i> was no less puzzling than mine. I now
looked him steadily in the face, and went on in a sterner tone.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Two days afterwards he returned indeed from court; but,
instead of leading his victim to the altar, he sent word to the poor girl
that he had once more changed his mind, and would not marry her.
Her indignant friends hastened to his house. The villain no longer kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
any measures with them, but defied them to hurt him, telling them
that if the Frenchwomen were disposed to give him any trouble, they
had better take care of themselves. On hearing this intelligence, the
young woman fell into convulsions so violent, that her life was long
despaired of. In the midst of their desolation, the elder wrote to
France an account of the public affront that they had received.
They had a brother, who, deeply moved by the story, flew to Madrid,
determined to investigate the affair to the bottom. <i>I</i> am that
brother. <i>It is I</i> who have left everything&mdash;my country, my family,
my duties&mdash;to avenge in Spain the cause of an innocent and unhappy
sister. <i>It is I</i> who come, armed with justice and resolution, to
unmask and punish a villain; and <i>it is you</i> who are that villain.'</p>

<p class="indent">"It is easier to imagine than describe the appearance
of this man by the time I had concluded my speech. His mouth opened
from time to time, and inarticulate sounds died away on his tongue.
His countenance, at first so radiant with complacency and satisfaction,
gradually darkened; his eyes became dim, his features lengthened,
his complexion pale and haggard.</p>

<p class="indent">"He tried to stammer out some phrases by way of justification.
'Do not interrupt me, sir,' I said; 'you have nothing to say to me,
and much to hear from me. In the first place, have the goodness to
declare before this gentleman, who has accompanied me from France
on account of this very business, whether, owing to any want of faith,
levity, weakness, ill-temper, or any other fault, my sister has deserved
the double outrage she has received from you.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'No, sir; I acknowledge Donna Maria, your sister, to be
a young lady full of charms, accomplishments, and virtues.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Has she ever, since you have known her, given you
any ground of complaint?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'No, never.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Well, then, monster that you are! why have you had the
barbarity to bring a poor girl to death's door, merely because her heart
gave you the preference over half a dozen other persons more respectable
and better than you?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Ah, sir, I have been advised, instigated: if you knew&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p class="indent">"I interrupted him: 'That is quite sufficient,' I said. Then,
turning to my friend, 'You have heard my sister's justification; pray
go, and make it known. What I have further to say to this gentleman
requires no witness.'</p>

<p class="indent">"My friend left the room. Clavijo rose,
but I made him resume his seat.</p>

<p class="indent">"'It does not suit my views, any more than yours, that you
should marry my sister; and you are probably aware that I am not come
here to play the brother's part in a comedy, who desires to bring
about his sister's happiness, as it is called. You have thought fit to
insult a respectable young woman, because you thought her friendless
in a strange land; your conduct has been base and dishonourable.
You will please, therefore, to begin by acknowledging, under your
hand, at perfect freedom, with all your doors open and all your domestics
in the room, (who will not understand us, as we shall speak
French,) that you have causelessly deceived, betrayed, insulted
my sister. With this declaration in my hand I shall hasten to
Aranjuez, where our ambassador is; I shall show him the paper, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
then have it printed; to-morrow it shall be abundantly circulated
through the court and the city. I have some credit here&mdash;I have
time and money; all shall be employed to deprive you of your place,
and to pursue you without respite, and in every possible way, till my
sister herself shall entreat me to forbear.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'I shall make no such declaration,' said Clavijo, almost
inarticulate from agitation.</p>

<p class="indent">"'I dare say not, for I don't think, were I in your place,
that I should do so myself. But you must consider the other alternative.
From this moment I remain at your elbow. I will not leave you a
moment. Wherever you go, I will go, till you shall have no other way
of getting rid of so troublesome a neighbour but by going with me behind
the Palace of Buen Retiro. If I am the survivor, sir, without
even seeing the ambassador, or speaking to a single soul here, I shall
take my dying sister in my arms, put her in my carriage, and return
with her to France. If the luck is yours, all is ended with me.
You will then be at liberty to enjoy your triumph, and laugh at your
dupes as much as you please. Will you have the goodness to order
breakfast.'</p>

<p class="indent">"I rose, and rang the bell; a servant brought in breakfast.
I took my cup of chocolate, while Clavijo, in deep thought, walked about
the room. At length he seemed all at once to form a resolution.</p>

<p class="indent">"'M. de Beaumarchais,' he said, 'hear me. Nothing on earth
can justify my conduct towards your sister; ambition has been my
ruin; but if I had imagined that Donna Maria had a brother like you,
far from looking upon her as a stranger without friends or connexions,
I should have anticipated the greatest advantages from our union.
You have inspired me with the greatest esteem; and I throw myself
on your generosity, beseeching you to assist me in redressing, as far
as I am able, the injuries I have done your sister. Restore her to
me, sir; and I shall esteem myself too happy in receiving, from your
hands, my wife and forgiveness of my offences.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'It is too late,' I replied; 'my sister no longer loves you.
Write a declaration,&mdash;that is all I require of you; and be satisfied
that, as an open enemy, I will avenge my sister's wrongs till her own
resentment is appeased.'</p>

<p class="indent">"He made many difficulties; objecting to the style in which
I demanded his declaration; to its being all in his hand-writing; and to
my insisting that the domestics should be in the room while he was
writing it. But the alternative was pressing, and he had probably
some lurking hope of regaining the affections of the woman who
had loved him so long. His pride, therefore, gave way; and he submitted
to write the declaration, which I dictated to him, walking
about the room. It contained an ample testimony to the blameless
character of my sister, and an acknowledgment of his causeless
treachery towards her.</p>

<p class="indent">"When he had written and signed the paper, I put it in my
pocket, and took my leave, repeating what I had said, as to the use
I meant to make of it. He besought me, at least, to tell my sister
of the marks of sincere repentance he had exhibited; and I promised
to do so.</p>

<p class="indent">"My friend's return before me, to my sister's, had produced
great alarm in the little circle that were waiting for us. I found the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
females in tears, and the men very uneasy. But when they heard my
account of my interview, and saw the declaration, the general anxiety
was turned into joy and congratulation. Every one was of a different
opinion: some insisted on ruining Clavijo; others were inclined
to forgive him; and others, again, were for leaving everything
to my prudence. My sister entreated that she might never hear of
him more. I resolved to go to Aranjuez and lay the whole affair before
the Marquis D'Ossun, our ambassador.</p>

<p class="indent">"Before setting out, I wrote to Clavijo, telling him that my
sister would not hear a word in his favour, and that I was therefore determined
to adhere to my intention of doing all I could to avenge her
injuries. He begged to see me; and I went without hesitation to his
house. His language was full of the most bitter self-reproach; and,
after many earnest entreaties, he obtained my permission to visit my
elder sister, accompanied by a mutual friend, and my promise, in case
he should fail in obtaining forgiveness, not to publish his dishonour
till after my return from Aranjuez.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Marquis D'Ossun received me very kindly. I told him my
story, concluding with an account of my meeting with Clavijo, which
he could hardly credit, till I showed him the declaration. He asked
me what were my views&mdash;did I desire to make Clavijo marry my
sister?&mdash;'No, my lord, my object is to disgrace him publicly.' The
Marquis dissuaded me from proceeding to extremities. Clavijo, he
said, was a rising man, and evidently in the way of great advancement;
ambition had alienated him from my sister; but ambition, repentance,
or affection, seemed to be bringing him back; all things
considered, Clavijo seemed an advantageous match, and the wisest
thing I could do was to get the marriage celebrated immediately.
He hinted further, that, by following his advice, I should do him a
pleasure, for reasons which he could not explain.</p>

<p class="indent">"I returned to Madrid, much troubled by the result of
this conference. On arriving at my sister's, I found that Clavijo had been
there, accompanied by some mutual friends, in order to beseech my
sisters to forgive him. Maria, on his appearance, had fled to her own
room, and would not appear; and I was told he had conceived hopes
from this little ebullition of resentment. I concluded, for my part, that
he was well acquainted with woman, whose soft and tender nature,
however deeply she may have been injured, is always prone to pardon
the repentant lover whom she sees kneeling at her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">"After my return from Aranjuez, Clavijo found means to
see me every day. I was delighted with his talents and attainments, and,
above all, with the manly confidence he appeared to have in my mediation.
I was sincerely desirous to favour his suit; but the profound
respect which my poor sister had for my judgment rendered
me very circumspect in regard to her. It was her happiness, and not
her fortune, that I wished to secure; her heart, and not her hand,
that I wished to dispose of.</p>

<p class="indent">"On the 25th of May, Clavijo suddenly left the house of
M. Portugues, and retired to the house of an officer of his acquaintance,
in the quarters of the invalids. This hasty move appeared somewhat
singular, though it did not, at the moment, give me any uneasiness.
I went to see him: he explained his precipitate retreat by saying
that, as M. Portugues was very much opposed to his marriage, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
thought he could not give me a better proof of his sincerity than by
leaving the house of so powerful an enemy of my sister. This appeared
probable, and I felt obliged to him for so delicate a proceeding.</p>

<p class="indent">"Next day I received a letter from him, breathing the utmost
frankness, honour, and good feeling. He renewed his offer of marriage,
if my sister would only forgive his past conduct. He protested
the most devoted and unalterable love for her; and called
upon me to perform my promise of interceding for him. If it were
possible for him, he said, to leave Madrid without an express order
from the head of his department, he would instantly set out for
Aranjuez to obtain that minister's consent to the marriage: he therefore
begged that I would undertake that matter for him; and said
that my prompt compliance would be the most convincing proof of
my sincere good wishes.</p>

<p class="indent">"I read this letter to my sisters; Maria burst into tears.
I embraced her tenderly. 'Well, poor child, you love him after all; and
are mightily ashamed of it, no doubt! I see it all; but never mind&mdash;you
are a good excellent girl, notwithstanding; and since your resentment
is dying away, let it be extinguished altogether in the tears of
forgiveness. They are sweet and soothing after tears of grief and
anger. He is a sad fellow, this Clavijo, to be sure, like most men;
but, such as he is, I join our worthy ambassador in advising you to
forgive him. For his own sake, perhaps,' I added, laughing, 'I might
have been as well pleased had he fought me; for yours, I am much
better pleased that he has not.'</p>

<p class="indent">"I ran on in this way till my sister began to smile in
the midst of her tears. I took this as a silent consent, and hastened away in
search of her lover. I told him he was a hundred times happier than
he deserved; and he agreed that I was in the right. I brought him
to my sister's. The poor girl was overwhelmed, on all hands, by
entreating friends, till at last, with a blush and a sigh of mingled
pleasure and shame, she whispered a consent that we might dispose
of her as we pleased. Clavijo was in raptures. In his joy, he ran to
my writing-desk, and wrote a paper containing a brief but formal
mutual engagement, which he signed, and then kneeling, presented
it to my sister for her signature. The gentlemen present, joined their
entreaties to his, and thus a written consent was extorted from my
poor sister, who, no longer knowing where to hide her head, threw
herself weeping into my arms, whispering in my ear, that really I was
a hard-hearted man, and had no pity for her.</p>

<p class="indent">"We spent a very happy evening, as may well be imagined. At
eleven o'clock I set out for Aranjuez, for in that warm climate the
night is the pleasantest time for travelling. I communicated all that
had passed to the ambassador, who was much pleased, and praised
my conduct more than it deserved. I then waited on M. de Grimaldi,
the minister at the head of Clavijo's department. He received me
kindly, gave his consent to the marriage, and wished my sister every
happiness; but observed that Don Joseph Clavijo might have spared
me the journey, because a letter to the minister was the usual form,
and would have been quite sufficient.</p>

<p class="indent">"On my return to Madrid, I found a letter from Clavijo, written
in great apparent agitation, in which he told me, that copies of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
pretended declaration, said to be by him, had got into circulation, and
that it was in such terms that he could not show his face while impressions
subsisted so derogatory to his character and honour. He
therefore begged me to show the paper he had really signed, and give
copies of it. Subjoined to his letter was a copy of this pretended
declaration, which was conceived in the most false, exaggerated, and
abominable language, and was all in his own hand-writing. He
further said, that, in the mean time, and till the public should be
disabused, <i>it would be better that we should not see each other for a few
days</i>; for, if we did, it might be supposed that the pretended paper
was the real one, and that the other, now appearing for the first time,
was concocted afterwards.</p>

<p class="indent">"I was a little out of humour at the conclusion drawn by
Clavijo from this base fabrication. I reproached him gently for taking such
an unreasonable view of the matter; and, as I found him unwell, I
promised that as soon as he was able to go out, we should go everywhere
together, and that I should make it appear that I looked upon
him as a brother and an honourable man.</p>

<p class="indent">"We made all the arrangements for the marriage. In case he
might not be fully supplied with money, I offered him my purse; and
I presented him with some jewels and French laces, to enable him to
make my sister a wedding gift. He accepted the jewels and laces,
because, as he said, it would be difficult to find anything so handsome
at Madrid; but I could not prevail on him to receive the money I
offered him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Next day, a Spanish valet robbed me of a large sum
of money and a number of valuable articles. I immediately waited on the
governor of Madrid to make my complaint, and was somewhat surprised
at the very cold reception I met with. I wrote to the French
ambassador on the subject, and thought no more of it.</p>

<p class="indent">"I continued my attentions to my sick friend, which were
received with every appearance of affectionate gratitude; but, on the 5th of
June, when I came as usual to see him, I found, to my utter
astonishment, that he had, once more, suddenly decamped.</p>

<p class="indent">"I got inquiries made after him at all the lodging-houses in
Madrid, and at last discovered his new abode. I expressed my surprise
in stronger language than on the previous occasion. He told
me that he had learned that his friend with whom he was staying,
had been blamed for sharing with another a lodging which was given
by the king for his own use only; and that he had been so much
hurt at this, that he thought it necessary to leave his friend's apartments
instantly, without regarding the embarrassment it might occasion,
the state of his health, the untimely hour, or any other consideration.
I could not but approve of his delicacy; but kindly
scolded him for not having come to reside at my sister's, whither I
offered to take him at once. He thanked me most affectionately, but
found some reason for excusing himself.</p>

<p class="indent">"Next day, under trifling pretexts, he refused my repeated
offers of an apartment at my sister's. My friends began to shake their
heads, and my sister looked anxious and unhappy. It was similar
evasions that had twice already preceded his total desertion. I felt
angry at these forebodings, which I insisted were groundless; but I
found that suspicion was creeping into my own mind. To get rid of it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
on the day fixed for signing the contract, (the seventh of June,) I
sent for the apostolic notary, whose function it is to superintend this
ceremony. But what was my surprise when this official told me that
he was going to make Señor Clavijo sign a declaration of a very
different nature; as he had, the day before, received a writ of
opposition to my sister's marriage, on the part of a young woman who
affirmed that she had a promise from Clavijo, given in 1755, nine
years before!</p>

<p class="indent">"I inquired who the woman was, and was told by the notary
that she was a waiting-woman. In a transport of rage, I ran to Clavijo,
loaded him with threats and reproaches. He besought me to moderate
my anger and suspend my opinion. He had long ago, he said,
made some such promise to Madame Portugues's waiting-woman,
who was a pretty girl; but he had never since heard of it, and believed
that the girl was now set on by some enemy of Donna Maria.
The affair, he assured me, was a trifle, and could be got rid of by the
aid of a few pistoles. He repeated his vows of eternal constancy to
Maria, and begged me to return at eight o'clock in the evening, when
he would go with me to an eminent advocate, who would easily put
him on the way of getting rid of this trifling obstacle.</p>

<p class="indent">"I left him, full of indecision and bitterness of heart.
I could make nothing of his conduct, or imagine any reasonable object he
could have in deceiving me. At eight o'clock I returned to his
lodgings with two of my friends; but we had hardly got out of the
carriage, when the landlady came to the door, and told me that Señor
Clavijo had removed from her house an hour before, and was gone
she knew not whither.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thunderstruck at this intelligence, and unable to believe
it, I went up to the room he had occupied. Every thing belonging to him
had been carried off. Perplexed and dismayed, I returned home, and
had no sooner arrived than a courier from Aranjuez brought me a
letter, which he had been ordered to deliver with the utmost speed.
It was from the French ambassador. He informed me that the
governor of Madrid had just been with him, to tell him that Señor
Clavijo had retired to a place of safety, in order to protect himself
from the violence he apprehended from me, as I had, a few days
before, compelled him, in his own house, and with a pistol at his
breast, to sign an engagement to marry my sister. The Marquis, at
the same time, expressed his belief of my innocence; but feared that
the affair might be turned to my disadvantage, and requested that I
would do nothing whatever until I had seen him.</p>

<p class="indent">"I was utterly confounded. This man, who for weeks had been
treating me like a brother,&mdash;who had been writing me letter upon
letter, full of affection,&mdash;who had earnestly besought me to give him
my sister, and had visited her again and again as her betrothed
husband,&mdash;this monster had been all the while secretly plotting my
destruction!</p>

<p class="indent">"Suddenly an officer of the Walloon guards came into
the room. 'M. de Beaumarchais,' he said, 'you have not a moment to lose.
Save yourself, or to-morrow morning you will be arrested in your bed.
The order is given, and I am come to apprise you of it. Your adversary
is a monster. He has contrived to set almost everybody against
you, and has led you into snare after snare, till he has found means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
to make himself your public accuser. Fly instantly, I beseech you.
Once immured in a dungeon, you will have neither protection nor defence.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'I fly!&mdash;I make my escape!&mdash;I will die sooner.
Say not a word more, my friends. Let me have a travelling carriage to-morrow
morning at four o'clock, and meanwhile leave me to prepare for my journey to Aranjuez.'</p>

<p class="indent">"I shut myself up in my room. My mind was utterly exhausted.
I threw myself into a chair, where I remained for two hours in a state
of total vacuity of thought. At length I roused myself. I reflected
on all the circumstances of the case, and on the abundant proofs of
my integrity. I sat down to my desk, and, with the rapidity of a
man in a high fever, I wrote an exact journal of my actions since my
arrival at Madrid: names, dates, conversations,&mdash;everything sprang,
as it were, into my memory, and fixed itself under my pen. I was
still writing at five in the morning, when I was told that my carriage
was ready. Some friends wanted to accompany me. 'I wish to be
alone,' I said. 'Twelve hours of solitude are not more than necessary
to calm the agitation of my frame.' I set out for Aranjuez.</p>

<p class="indent">"When I arrived, the ambassador was at the palace, and I
could not see him till eleven o'clock at night. He was glad, he said, I was
come; for he had been very uneasy about me. During the last fortnight
my adversary had gained all the avenues of the palace; and, had it
not been for him, I should have been already arrested, and probably
sent to a dungeon for life, on the African coast. He had done what
he could with M. Grimaldi, the minister, to whom he had earnestly
represented his conviction of my probity and honour; but all was
without effect. 'You must really go, M. de Beaumarchais,' he continued.
'You have not a moment to lose. I can do nothing in opposition
to the general impression against you, or against the positive
order that has been issued for your imprisonment; and I should be
sincerely grieved should any calamity happen to you in this country.
You must leave Spain instantly.'</p>

<p class="indent">"I did not shed tears while he was speaking, but large drops
of water fell at intervals from my eyes, gathered in them by the contraction
of my whole frame. I was stupified and speechless. The
ambassador was affected by my situation, and spoke to me in the
kindest and most soothing manner; but still persisted in saying that
I must yield to necessity, and escape from consequences which could
not otherwise be averted. I implored him to think of the ruin to
my own character in France if I fled from Spain under such
circumstances;&mdash;to consider the situation of my unhappy, innocent sister.
He said he would write to France, where his account of my conduct
would be credited; and that, as to my sister, he would not neglect
her. I could bear this conversation no longer; but, abruptly quitting
his presence, I rushed out of the house, and wandered all night in
the dark alleys of the park of Aranjuez, in a state of inexpressible
anguish.</p>

<p class="indent">"In the morning, my courage rose; and, determined to obtain
justice or perish, I repaired to the levee of M. Grimaldi, the minister.
While I waited in his ante-chamber, I heard several voices pronounce
the name of M. Whal. That distinguished and venerable
statesman, who had retired from the ministry that, in the close of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
life, he might have a brief interval of repose, was then residing in
M. Grimaldi's house. I heard this, and was suddenly inspired with
the idea of having recourse to him for protection. I requested permission
to see him, as a stranger who had something of importance
to communicate. I was admitted; and the sight of his mild and
noble countenance gave me courage. I told him that my only claim
to his favour was that I was a native of the country in which he himself
was born, persecuted almost to death by cruel and powerful
enemies; but this title, I trusted, was sufficient to obtain for me the
protection of a just and virtuous man.</p>

<p class="indent">"'You are a Frenchman,' he said, 'and that is always a strong
claim with me. But you tremble&mdash;you are pale and breathless; sit
down&mdash;compose yourself, and tell me the cause of such violent agitation.'
He ordered that no one should be admitted; and I, in an
unspeakable state of hope and fear, requested permission to read my
journal of occurrences since my arrival in Madrid. He complied,
and I began to read. As I went on, he from time to time begged me
to be calm, and to read more slowly that he might follow me the
better; assuring me that he took the greatest interest in my narrative.
As I proceeded, I laid before him in succession the letters and
other documents which were referred to. But when I came to the
criminal charge against me,&mdash;to the order for my imprisonment, which
had been only suspended for a little by M. Grimaldi at the request
of our ambassador,&mdash;to the urgent advices which I had received to
make my escape, but which I avowed my determination not to follow,&mdash;he
uttered an exclamation, rose, and took me kindly by the
hand:</p>

<p class="indent">"'Unquestionably the king will do you justice, M. de
Beaumarchais. The ambassador, in spite of his regard for you, is obliged to
act with the caution which befits his office; but I am under no such
restraint. It shall never be said that a respectable Frenchman, after
leaving his home, his friends, his business,&mdash;after having travelled a
thousand miles to succour an innocent and unfortunate sister, has
been driven from this country, carrying with him the impression that
no redress or justice is to be obtained in Spain. It was I who placed
this Clavijo in the king's service, and I feel myself responsible for his
infamous conduct. Good God! how unhappy it is for statesmen that
they cannot become sufficiently aware of the real character of the
persons they employ, and thus get themselves surrounded by specious
knaves, of whose shameful actions they often bear the blame. A
minister may be forgiven for being deceived in the choice of a worthless
subordinate; but when once he comes to a knowledge of his character,
there is no excuse for retaining him a moment. For my
part, I shall immediately set a good example to my successors.'</p>

<p class="indent">"So saying, he rang, ordered his carriage, and took me
with him to the palace. He sent for M. Grimaldi; and, while waiting for the
arrival of that minister, went into the king's closet, and told his majesty
the story, accusing himself of indiscretion in recommending
such a man to his majesty's favour. M. Grimaldi came; and I was
called into the royal presence. 'Read your memorial,' said M.
Whal,&mdash;'every feeling and honourable heart must be as much moved
by it as I was.' I obeyed. The king listened with attention and interest;
examined the proofs of my statements; and the result was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
order that Clavijo should be deprived of his employment, and dismissed
for ever from his majesty's service."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">From subsequent parts of the narrative, it appears
that Clavijo exerted all his powers of cunning and intrigue in order to get himself
re-instated in his situation; not omitting further attempts to impose
upon M. de Beaumarchais, accompanied with abject entreaties and
hypocritical professions. All, however, was in vain; and this man,
who seems to have been an extraordinary compound of intellectual
ability and moral depravity, seems to have sunk into contempt and
insignificance. The young lady recovered the shock she had received;
and was afterwards happily married, and settled at Madrid.</p>

<span class="i0">Who thus began: "Ah! Cupid, why</span>

<span class="i0">So, turning to her wounded lover,</span>
<span class="i0">She kindly urged him to discover</span>

<span class="i0">With sudden flush his pallid cheek,</span>

<span class="i0">And o'er the corpse-impeded field</span>
<span class="i0">The cry was still 'They yield!&mdash;they yield!'</span>
<span class="i0">But soon, the flying ranks to stay,</span>
<span class="i0">Thy hated rivals joined the fray;</span>
<span class="i0">They nerved, with some accursed charm,</span>

<span class="i0">The highest honours of the fight;</span>
<span class="i0">I know not why, but, at the sight&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Eternal shame upon my head!&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">A panic seized me, and I fled&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">I fled, like chaff before the wind,</span>
<span class="i0">And, ah! my wounds are all&mdash;behind!"</span>
<span class="i0">When thus at length the truth was told,</span>
<span class="i2">(The shameful truth of his disgrace,)</span>
<span class="i0">Again, within his mantle's fold,</span>
<span class="i2">The wounded coward hid his face; <b>(<i>c</i>)</b></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst Venus, springing from his side,</span>
<span class="i0">With looks of scornful anger, cried,</span>

<span class="i0">Forgetful of her recent wound,</span>

<h2>THE DEVIL AND JOHNNY DIXON.</h2>
<p class="f110">BY THE AUTHOR OF "<b>STORIES OF WATERLOO</b>."</p>

<p class="blockquot space-above1">
&emsp;<i>Arnold.</i> Your form is man's, and yet you may be the devil.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent"><i>Stranger.</i> Unless you keep company with him (and you
seem scarce used to such high company) you can't tell how he approaches.</p>

<p class="author"><i>The Deformed Transformed.</i></p>

<p class="indent space-above1">I remember having been exceedingly amused by a
book of German <i>diablerie</i>, in which the movements of his Satanic Majesty
were faithfully and fashionably chronicled. He had chosen, it would appear,
for good and cogent reasons, to revisit our earth <i>incognito</i>; and
as potentates steal occasionally a glance at the world to see how
things move in their ordinary courses, he too indulged his princely
curiosity, and, <i>selon la règle</i>, during his travels assumed a
borrowed title.</p>

<p class="indent">I had business to transact in a very remote district of the
kingdom of Connaught, and, as some delay was unavoidable, I threw a few
books carelessly into my portmanteau. Among them the wild conception
of Hoffmann, entitled "The Devil's Elixir," was included; and
in the perusal of that strange tale, I endeavoured to amuse the tedium
of as wet a day as often comes in Connemara. Bad as the morning
had been, the evening was infinitely worse: the wind roared through
the mountains; the rain came down in torrents; and every unhappy
wayfarer pushed hastily for the nearest inn.</p>

<p class="indent">I had been an occupant of the best (and only) parlour of
Tim Corrigan during the preceding week; and so unfrequent were the calls at
his caravansera, that, like Robinson Crusoe, I could stroll out upon
the moor, and proclaim that I was absolute over heath and "hostelrie."
But, on this night, two travellers were driven to the "Cock
and Punchbowl." They were bound for a fair that was to be holden
on the morrow some twenty miles off; and, although anxious to lodge
themselves in some more contiguous hostel, the weather became so
desperate, that by mutual consent they abandoned their intention, and
resolved to ensconce themselves for the night in a double-bedded
room, which, fortunately for them, happened to be unoccupied in the
"Cock and Punchbowl."</p>

<p class="indent">Had their resolution to remain been doubtful, one glance
at the kitchen fire would have confirmed it. There, a well-conditioned goose
was twisting, on a string appended to the chimney-breast; while divers
culinary utensils simmered on the blazing turf, giving sure indications
that other adjuncts were to accompany the bird, and the dinner
would be a substantial one. I, while taking "mine ease in mine
inn," had seen the travellers arrive; and, the door being ajar, heard
the "to ride or not to ride" debated. That question settled, other
cares arose.</p>

<p class="indent">"Tim," said the younger guest to the landlord, as he
nodded significantly at the goose, "I'm hungry as a hawk."</p>

<p class="indent">The host shrugged his shoulders, and, pointing to the
"great chamber," where I was seated, replied in an undertone, "There's a
customer before ye, Master Johnny."</p>

<p class="indent">"A customer!&mdash;only one, Tim?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Sorrow more," replied the host.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, the curse of Cromwell on ye for a cormorant!" said the
traveller. "Three priests, after confessing half a parish, would scarcely
demolish that wabbler. I'll invite myself to dinner; and if I be not
in at the dissection, it won't be Johnny Dixon's fault."</p>

<p class="indent">"Arrah! the devil a fear of that," returned the landlord. "Your
modesty nivir stopped your promotion, <i>Shawn avourneen</i>!<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
" and he of the Cock and Punchbowl laughed heartily as the traveller entered
the parlour.</p>

<p class="indent">He was a stout, middle-sized, foxy-headed fellow of some six or
eight-and-twenty. His face was slightly marked with small-pox, and plain,
but not unpleasing. The expression was good-humoured and intelligent;
while, in the sparkle of his light blue eye, there was a pretty
equal proportion of mirth and mischief. He advanced to me with perfect
nonchalance; nodded as if he had known me for a twelvemonth;
and, as if conferring a compliment, notified with great brevity that it
was his intention to honour me with his company. No proposition
could have pleased me better, and it was fortunate that I had no wish
to remain alone; for, I verily believe, the traveller had already made
up his mind, <i>coute qui coute</i>, to aid and assist in demolishing the
bird that saved the Capitol.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the hostess announced that all preparations were
complete. The traveller, who had been talking of divers affairs, rural and
political, suddenly changed the conversation. "There was," he said,
"an unlucky sinner outside, who like himself had been storm-stayed
that evening. He was a priest's nephew, a harmless poor devil,
whom the old fellow had worked like a nigger, until one sweet evening
he smothered himself in poteen-punch, leaving Peter Feaghan a
kettleful of gold. If he, Peter, were only let in, he would pray for
me during life; and, as to eating, would be contented with the drumsticks."</p>

<p class="indent">I laughed, and assented; and "Master Johnny" speedily
produced a soft-looking, bullet-headed farmer; who, after scraping his leg
across the floor, sate himself down at the corner of the table.</p>

<p class="indent">Dinner came. I, since I breathed the keen air of Connemara,
had felt a quickened appetite; but "Master Johnny" double-distanced
me easily as a trencher-man, and he, in turn, could not hold a candle
to the nephew of the defunct priest. Peter Feaghan was a silent and
a steady workman, and I firmly believe the drumsticks were regularly
skeletonized before the priest's heir was disposed to cry "Hold,
enough!" At last the cloth was removed; and a quart-bottle, a basin
of sugar, with a jug of boiling water of enormous capacity, were set down.</p>

<p class="indent">"What an infernal night it is!" ejaculated the younger traveller,
as a gust of wind drove the hail against the window. "Were you not
in luck," he continued, "that chance drove two Christian men, like
Peter and me, among the mountains? Honest Tim is speechless by
this hour, or he has shortened his allowance greatly since I was here
last. No flirting in the house, for Mrs. Corrigan is a Carmelite, and
<i>Brideen dhu</i><a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
has bundled off with a <i>peeler</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
In short, you must have got drunk in self-defence, and, for lack of
company, as I have often done, drank one hand against the other."</p>

<p class="indent">"Or," said I, "diluted the poteen with a draught of
'The Devil's Elixir.'"</p>

<p class="indent">"The Devil's Elixir!" repeated the foxy-headed traveller;
"and pray what may that be?"</p>

<p class="indent">In reply, I handed him a volume of the Prussian Counsellor;
he looked at the title-page, and read the motto, "<i>In that yeare the
Deville was alsoe seene walking publiclie on the streetes of
Berline</i>." Laughing loudly, he turned to the priest's heir.</p>

<p class="indent">"Holy Mary! had your poor uncle Paul been in town, he would
have had a shy at ould Beelzebub, or made him quit the flagway."</p>

<p class="indent">"And who was Uncle Paul?" I inquired of the stranger.</p>

<p class="indent">"What!" he exclaimed, in manifest astonishment, "not know that
excellent and gifted churchman,&mdash;one before whom the devil shook
like a whipped schoolboy?"</p>

<p class="indent">"And was Mr. Feaghan's influence over him, surnamed 'the Morning
Star,' so extraordinary?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Extraordinary you may well call it," resumed Foxy-Head. "The
very mention of Paul's name would produce an ague-fit. Many a set-to
they had&mdash;a clear stage and no favour&mdash;and in all and every, the
devil was regularly floored. There is the old house of
Knockbraddigan,&mdash;for months, man, woman, or child could not close an eye.
Priest, monk, and friar, all tried their hands in vain. Holy-water
was expended by the gallon&mdash;masses said thrice a week&mdash;a saint's
finger borrowed for the occasion, and brought all the way from Cork,&mdash;and
even the stable-lantern had a candle in it, blessed by the
bishop. For all these 'Clooty' did not care a button, when Father
Paul toddled in, and saved the house and owner."</p>

<p class="indent">"Indeed?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay! and I'll tell you the particulars. It was the year after the
banks broke&mdash;times were bad&mdash;tenants racked&mdash;and Tom Braddigan,
like many a better man, poor fellow! was cleaned out by the sheriff.
Never was a <i>shuck</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
sinner harder up for a few hundreds; and, to
make a long story short, <i>Hoofey</i> came in the way, and Tom 'sould
himself' regularly. I never heard the sum, but it is said that it was
a large figure; and that, to give the devil his due, he never cobbled
for a moment, but paid a sporting price, and came down like a
man. Well, the tenure-day came round; Clooty was true to time,
and claimed his customer: but Tom was awake; Paul Feaghan was
at his elbow, and, as it turned out, Paul proved himself nothing but a
good one.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Arrah! what do ye want here, honest man?' says the priest to
the devil, opening the conversation civilly.</p>

<p class="indent">"'No offence, I suppose,' says the other,
'for a body to look after his own.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'None in the world,' replied Father Paul, answering
him quite politely; and all the while, poor Tom shaking like a Quaker.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Mr. Braddigan,' says the devil, 'we have a long drive before us,
and the carriage is waiting. Don't mind your <i>Cotamore</i>,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Tom; and the eternal ruffian put his tongue in his cheek. 'Though the day's
cold, 'pon my conscience, you shall have presently an air of the fire.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"'Asy,' says the priest, 'what call have you to a Catholic?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'A Catholic!' replied the devil, with a twist of his lip, mimicking
Father Paul; 'maybe your reverence would tell us when he was last at confession?'</p>

<p class="indent">"At this the priest lost temper. 'What the blazes,' says he, 'have
you to do with that? Was there any body present at the bargain
<i>betune</i><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
ye?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Hell to the one,' replied the devil.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Then,' says Father Paul, 'sorrow leg you would have to stand
on if the whole thing came before the barrister.'</p>

<p class="indent">"The devil gave a knowing look, and, dipping his hand into the
left breeches-pocket, took out a piece of paper, and, as an attorney
shows the corner of a promissory-note to an unwilling witness, he
held it out to Tom, and asked him was it his hand-writing: 'Tummas
a Brawdeen,'<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
says he, in Irish, 'is that yer fist?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'There's no denying it,' says Tom, with a shudder.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Then draw on yer boots, and let us be jogging.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Asy,' says Father Feaghan. 'Did ye get the consideration, Tom?'</p>

<p class="indent">"The devil seemed uncommonly affronted. 'Paul Feaghan,' says
he, 'I didn't think you would suppose that I would take his I.O.U. and
not post the coal! By my oath,' he continued, 'and let him contradict
me if he can, a Tuam note he would not touch with the tongs;
and the devil a flimsy would go down with him, good or bad, but a
regular Bank of Ireland!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Oh, be Jakers!' says the priest,
'you're done, Tom! Show me the note.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Bedershin!' says the devil,
clapping his right fore-finger on his nose.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Honour bright!' replied Father Paul.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Will ye return it?' inquired Old Hoofey.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Will a duck swim?' says the priest. 'Be this book,' says he,
laying his hand upon the tea-caddy, 'ye shall have it in two twos.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'There it is, then,' replied the other, 'and make your
best of it. Come, Tom, there's no turnpikes to pay where you're going to; so
on with your wrap-rascal,' pointing to the cotamore.</p>

<p class="indent">"But, sorrow wink was on Father Feaghan all the while.
He examined the note, and not a letter was wanting. It was regular, as if
the devil had been bound to an attorney&mdash;drawn on a three-shilling
stamp,&mdash;and, as he turned it round and round, it crumpled like singed
parchment.</p>

<p class="indent">"'You're dished,' ejaculated his reverence, looking over at Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Murder! murder!' says he, as Hoofey held out his hand for the I.O.U.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Arrah!' says Father Paul, 'do ye keep your papers in a tinderbox?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'They're over dry, I allow,' replied the devil; 'but in my place
it's hard to find a cool corner.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'We'll damp this one a little,' says the priest, slipping his hand
fair and asy into a mug of holy-water, and splashing half a pint of it
on <i>Tummas a Brawdeen's</i> note. 'Put that in yer pocket to balance yer pipe.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"In a moment the devil changed colour. 'Bad luck attend ye
night and day, for a circumventing villain!' says he.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Off with ye, you convicted ruffin!' roared Father Paul, making
a flourishing &#8224;; and before Tom Braddigan had time to bless himself,
Clooty went up the chimney in a flash of fire, leaving the room
untenantable for a fortnight, from the sulphur; and <i>Tummas a Brawdeen</i>
sung, for the remainder of his life, 'Wasn't that elegantly done?'"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing could be better," said I, as Red-head closed his story.
"What a sensation the affair must have occasioned. 'Like angels'
visits,' I presume, the old gentleman's are 'few and far between?'"</p>

<p class="indent">"By no means," returned the stranger, "there are few families
of any fashion in this country, who have not, at some period or other,
been favoured with a call; and I myself was once honoured by his
company at supper."</p>

<p class="indent">I stared at the man; but he bore my scrutiny without flinching.</p>

<p class="indent">"Had you a party to meet his Satanic Majesty?" I inquired, with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not a soul," replied he. "We supped <i>tête-à-tête</i>; and a pleasanter
fellow never stretched his legs beneath a man's mahogany."</p>

<p class="indent">"You certainly have excited my curiosity not a little," said I.</p>

<p class="indent">"If I have," returned the fox-headed stranger, "I shall most
willingly give you a full account of our interview.</p>

<p class="indent">"It was the first Friday after the winter fair of Boyle.
I was returning home in bad spirits; for, though I sold my bullocks
well, I had been regularly cleaned out at loo, and hit uncommonly
hard in a handicap. For three nights I scarcely won a
pool, and that was bad enough; but to lose the best weight-carrier
that was ever lapped in leather, for a paltry ten-pound note, and a
daisy-cutter with a fired leg and feathered eye, would make a saint
swear, and a Quaker kick his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">"Night had closed in, as I passed the cross-roads of Kilmactigue,
about two miles from home; and I pulled up into a walk, to bring
my bad bargain cool to the stable. Just then I heard a horse behind
me, coming on in a slapping trot; and, before you could say
Jack Robinson, a strange horseman was beside me.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Morra,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
 Mistre Dixon,' says he.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Morra to ye, sir,' says I, turning sharp about to see if
I could know him. He looked in the dim light a 'top-sawyer,' and, as far as
I could judge, the best-mounted man I had met for a month of Sundays.
He appeared to be dressed in black; his horse was the same
colour as his coat, and I began to tax my memory, hard, to recollect
the place where he and I had met before.</p>

<p class="indent">"'You have the advantage of me, sir,' says I.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Faith, and that's odd enough,' says he, 'for you and I rode
head and girth together at the stag-hunt at Rathgranaher.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Death and nouns!' says I, 'is this Mr. Magan?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'I believe so,' says he, 'for want of a better.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Ah! then,' said I, 'I'm glad I met you. Is that the black
mare that carried you so brilliantly?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'The same,' he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">"'No wonder I didn't know ye: you wore at Rathgranaher a
light-green coatee, and now you're black as a bishop.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"'I buried an aunt of mine lately,' says he.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Maybe you could do as much for a friend,' replied I;
'I have a couple at your service; and, as I pay them a hundred a year, I wish
them often at the devil.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'I'll make no objection on my part,' replied Mr. Magan. 'But
how far is it to Templebeg? It will be late before I reach it, I fear.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'It's the worst road in Connaught,' said I: 'my den is scarcely
a mile off; and, if you are not in a hurry, turn in for the night, and
you shall have a warm stall, a grilled bone, and a hearty welcome.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Never say it again,' says Mr. Magan; and on we rode, cheek by
jowl, talking of fairs, horses, and the coming election. Lord! nothing
came amiss to him: he was up to every thing, from <i>écarté</i> to robbing
the mail-coach; and in politics so knowing, that one while I fancied
him a Whig, and at the next I would have given my book
oath he was a black Orangeman.</p>

<p class="indent">"Before we reached the avenue,
I tried if he would 'stand a knock.'<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">"'Would you part with the mare?' says I.</p>

<p class="indent">"'If I was bid a sporting price, I would part with my grandmother,
if I had one,' was the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">"'What boot will you take, and turn tails?' said I.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Neighbour,' replied Mr. Magan, 'it must be a long figure that
gets Black Bess. What's that you're riding?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'A thorough-bred four-year old, by Langar, out of a Tom Pipes mare.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Bedershin!' says Mr. Magan; 'Tom died before you were born.'</p>

<p class="indent">"This was a hard hit. Devil a one of me knew how the horse
was bred; but, as he happened to be a chestnut, I thought I would
give Langar for a sire. Pretending not to hear the remark, I
continued,</p>

<p class="indent">"'He's uncommon fast up to twelve stone; will take five feet,
'coped and dashed,' without a balk; and live the longest day with any
fox-hounds on the province. At three years old, Peter Brannick refused
fifty for him.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'And didn't ask a rap for a dark eye and a ring-bone,'
observed Mr. Magan.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Oh!' says I, to myself, 'Magan, there's no coming over ye!'
So I thought that I had better leave horse-flesh alone, and try if I
could draw him at a setch of loo, or a hand of five and ten.</p>

<p class="indent">"With that we had ridden into the yard, and given our prads
to the men, with a hundred charges from the stranger, that his mare should
have a bran-mash and warm clothing. Well, I ushered him into
the parlour, and there was a roaring fire, and the cloth laid for supper;
for, luckily enough, Judy Mac Keal had expected me home.
Mr. Magan took off his cotamore, laid his hat and whip aside, and
then threw his eyes over the apartment.</p>

<p class="indent">"'<i>Mona mon diaoul!</i>'<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
says he, 'if there's a snugger hunting-box between Birr and Bantry.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Oh!' said I, 'the cabin's well enough for a loose lad
like me. Everything here is rough and ready; and, as it's a bachelor's shop,
you must make allowances.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Arrah! nabocklish!<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
I'm a single man myself, and it's wonderful how well I get my health,
and manage with a housekeeper. 'By-the-bye,' and he looked knowing as a jailor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
'is Judy Mac Keal with you still?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'And what do you know about Judy, neighbour?' says I.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Don't be offended,' replied he. 'The boys were joking
after supper at Dinny Balfe's; and Maurice Ffrench named her for face
and figure, against any mentioned, for a pony.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Ffrench is a fool!' I replied. 'But as you know Judy already,
we'll ring, and see if there's any chance of supper.'</p>

<p class="indent">"She answered the bell; told us the ducks were at the fire,
and that in half an hour all would be ready. When she went away,
Magan swore she was the best-looking trout he had laid eyes on for
a twelvemonth; and, spying out a pack of cards upon the chimney-piece,
proposed that we should kill time with a game of hookey or
lansquenet.</p>

<p class="indent">"It was the very thing I wanted; but I took the offer indifferently.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Egad! I'm afraid of you,' says I, as I laid the pack upon the
table-cloth. He cut the cards.</p>

<p class="indent">"'The deal is yours. What an infernal ass I am to touch paper,'
says he; and kissing the knave of clubs. 'By this book, I'm such an
unlucky devil, that I verily believe, had my father bound me to a hatter,
men would be born without heads. Come, down with the dust!'
and he pulled from his breast-pocket a parcel of notes as thick as an
almanack. They were chiefly fives and tens; and when I remarked
them all the black bank,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
I set him down a Northman.</p>

<p class="indent">"We played at first tolerably even; but, by the time supper
was served, I found myself a winner of twenty pounds. This was a good
beginning; and I determined to continue my good luck, and, if I
could, do Mr. Magan brown.</p>

<p class="indent">"Down we sate; my friend had an excellent appetite, and finished
a duck to his own share. We drank a bottle of sherry in double-quick,
got the cards again, and called for tumblers and hot water.</p>

<p class="indent">"Judy brought in the materials, and Mr. Magan began to quiz her.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Arrah! Miss Mac Keal,' says he, 'will ye come and keep house
for me, and I'll double your wages?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'And where do ye live?' replied she.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Down in the North,' returned Magan; 'and I have as nate a
place, ay, and as warm a house, as ever you laid a foot in!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Have done with your joking,' says Judy, 'and go home to your
own dacent wife.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'I have her yet to look for,' replied he.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Devil have the liars,' says Judy.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Ah then, amen!' said Magan.</p>

<p class="indent">"'I wouldn't believe ye,' continued she, 'if you kissed the vestment on it.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'<i>Liggum lathé</i>,'<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
says he.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Why, what good Irish you have for a Northman!' replied Judy.</p>

<p class="indent">"'My mother was a Munster woman,' says Mr. Magan.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Is she alive?' inquired she.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Dead as Cleopatra,' he said, with a laugh; and Judy afterwards
remarked, 'she knew he was a rascal, or he would have added, 'God rest her soul!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"When the housekeeper disappeared, the stranger filled a bumper.
'Egad!' thought I, 'I'll try him now, whether he be radical or true-blue;
and, lifting up the tumbler, I proposed, 'The glorious, pious,
and immortal memory&mdash;'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Of the great and good King William,' says he, taking the word
out of my mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Who freed us from Pope and popery, knavery, slavery&mdash;'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Brass money, and wooden shoes,' returned the Northman.</p>

<p class="indent">"'May he who would not, on bare and bended knee, drink this
toast, be rammed, crammed&mdash;'</p>

<p class="indent">"'And damned!' roared Magan, as if the sentiment came from his
very heart. 'Here's the Pope in the pillory, and the Devil pelting
priests at him!' cried the Northman; and, with a laugh, off went the
bumpers, and we commenced the cards anew.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, sir, that night I had the luck of thousands. The black
bank-notes came over the table-cloth by the dozen; and, as the
Northman lost his money, his temper went along with it. He cursed
the cards, and their maker; swore he would book himself<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
against bones and paper for a twelvemonth; made tumbler after tumbler;
and, as he drank them boiling from the kettle, I wondered how he
could swallow poteen-punch hot enough to scald a pig.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Come,' says he, in a rage, 'I see how the thing will end; and
the sooner I am cleaned out, the better. Instead of a beggarly flimsey,
fork out a five-pound note.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'With all my heart,' replied I.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Curse of Cromwell attend upon all shoemakers!' ejaculated Mr.
Magan, with a grin.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Arrah! what's vexing ye now?' says I, pulling the third five-pounder
across the cloth.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Every thing!' returned he, 'I have the worst of luck, a tight
boot, and a bad corn.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'I'll get ye slippers in a shake.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Mind your cards,' says he, rather cross; 'there's nobody here
but ourselves, and I'll pull off my boot quietly under the table!'</p>

<p class="indent">"He did so: we continued play; and, though he lost ahead, he
recovered his temper, and seemed to bear it like a gentleman. It
was quite clear that the boot had made him cranky. No wonder: an
angry corn and tight shoe would try the patience of a bride.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, the last of his bundle of bank-notes was in due course
transferred to me, and I fancied I had him 'polished off;' but, dipping
his hand into his big-coat pocket, he produced a green silk purse,
half a yard long, and stuffed, apparently, with sovereigns. I lighted
a cigar, and offered him another, but he declined it; and, after groping
his <i>cotamore</i> for half a minute, produced a <i>dudheen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
which he lighted at the candle. I have smoked tobacco here these ten
years,&mdash;Persian or pigstail were all the same to me;&mdash;but the first whiff
of Magan's pipe I thought would have smothered me on the spot.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Holy Bridget!' says I, gasping for breath. 'Arrah! what stuff
is that you're blowing?'</p>

<p class="indent">"'It's rather strong,' says he, 'but beautiful when you're
used to it. Cut the cards; and, as they say in Connaught, 'if money stands,
luck may turn.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Just then Judy come in to ask Mr. Magan if he would have a
second pair of blankets on his bed.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Will you come with me?' says he, putting his arm round her
jokingly.</p>

<p class="indent">"'God take ye, if possible!' cried Judy: 'pheaks! ye'r not over well
honest man, for your hand's in a fever!'</p>

<p class="indent">"'It's the liker my heart, Judy,' and he gave her a coaxing smile.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Sorrow one of me liked his making so free. 'Go on with your
game,' says I, 'and don't be putting your <i>comether</i><a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
over my housekeeper.'</p>

<p class="indent">"At the moment a horse-tramp was heard in the yard, and Judy
ran to the window.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Who's that?' says I. 'Devil welcome him, whoever he is;' for I
thought he would interrupt us.</p>

<p class="indent">"'It's a short man on a grey pony,' says Judy, 'with a big blue
cloak about him.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Phew!' and I whistled. 'It's Father Paul Feaghan.'</p>

<p class="indent">"'Father Paul!' ejaculated Mr. Magan, turning pale as a shirt-frill,
and dropping the <i>dudheen</i> on the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Oh, death and nouns! the carpet will be ruined!' roared Judy,
plumping down upon her knees, and snatching at the pipe; but, before
she reached it, she gave a wild scream, as if she saw a ghost, and
began blessing herself busily. But, scarcely had she made the sign
of the &#8224;, when a thunderclap shook the lodge; a blaze lightened
through the supper-room, and Mr. Magan, taking with him the black
bank-notes, and the hand of cards he was playing with, vanished up
the chimney. No doubt he would have taken the roof away into
the bargain, had not Father Paul been fortunately so near us."</p>

<p class="indent">"And," said I, "did no other evil consequences attend this unhallowed visit?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Evil consequences!" returned Johnny Dixon, as he repeated my
words: "my stable-boy was frightened into fits; Judy Mac Keal kept her

thirty shillings did not pay the glazier&mdash;for Magan,&mdash;the Lord's curse light

continued, addressing his companion; "and you and I, Peter, must
be up ere cockcrow. Good night, sir!" and he turned to me.
"Should you ever meet Mr. Magan&mdash;while you remain in his society,
never be persuaded, as they say in Mayo, to 'prove agreeable;' or,
'fight, flirt, play cards, or hold the candle.'"</p>

<h2>A MERRY CHRISTMAS.</h2>
<p class="f110 space-below2">BY THOMAS HAYNES BAYLY.</p>

<p class="author space-above1">Dover, December 20th, 1836.</p>
<p class="blockquot indent"><span class="smcap">Dear your Lordship</span>,&mdash;I never writ
to a lord before, and don't do it now spontaneous; but Mrs. Miggins desires me to ask
you to join our Christmas party next week. Now I think that will be what
you call a bore, because 'tisn't only us ourselves, but I can't give up
old friends and relations, and so there'll be more Migginses than you
ever saw before; and, always excepting daughter Sophy, I suspect
you've seen more already than you ever wish to see again. However,
daughter Sophy did seem to attract your notice like, last autumn
here, when you was staying with the duke. I saw clear enough you
didn't want the duke nor the duchess to know about it, and so I were
glad when you took yourself away; but Sophy hankers after you, and
my wife says,&mdash;and she's right enough there, though it doesn't generally
follow that a thing's right because she says it,&mdash;that there's no
reason why daughter Sophy shouldn't be a lord's wife and a lady herself,
like other fine girls no ways her betters; and, though I did
make my money in the soap and candle line, the money, now it's
made, an't the worse; and so, if you really wants to marry Sophy, say
it out and out, and I'll give my consent. It is but fair and right to
tell your Lordship that there's another young man desperate about
her,&mdash;not, when I say another young man, that I mean to call your
lordship a young man, for I know that wouldn't be respectful. However,
if I had my own way in all things,&mdash;which I haven't, and few men
have,&mdash;Captain Mills of the artillery would be the man for Sophy. He's
a mighty proper man to look at, and I've asked him down to spend
Christmas here too; so, if your lordship don't think it worth while
to come, why only say the word, and, to my thinking, Captain Mills
will have a good chance.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">People do report things that I don't want to believe
about your lordship's ways of going on; but if you do marry Sophy, hang it!
make her happy. Don't take her away from them as loves her, and
then be neglectful and unkind; for she don't know yet what unkindness
is, and I know 'twould break her heart, and then I should break
mine, and my poor wife would follow,&mdash;so that would break us all.
But a lord must be a gentlemen, and a gentleman can't behave like a
blackguard to a woman. So some down here on Saturday the 24th,
and we'll have a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. In all
which my wife and Sophy do join. So no more at present</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">From your dear lordship's</span>
<span class="i18">humble servant at command,</span>
<span class="i30"><span class="smcap">Peter Miggins</span>.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Peter Miggins's letter to Lord John Lavender has probably
sufficiently introduced him to the reader. The right honourable personage
to whom that letter was addressed was the youngest son of a
duke, and in all respects as great a contrast to all the blood of the
Migginses as can possibly be imagined.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Lord John had been, for many years, one of the best-looking
men about town; so many years, indeed, had he been a beauty, that it
was quite wonderful to detect no change in his figure, face, or manner.
He still looked as he always had looked, and probably always intended
to look. There is this one great advantage in beginning to <i>make
up</i> early in life,&mdash;nobody detects any difference. The toilet requires
a more protracted attention, and a steadier hand; but, once completed,
to the eye of the observer the colours and the outline are the
same. No woman ever thought more about her appearance than did
Lord John Lavender; yet there was a manliness in his manner and
conversation which rescued him from the charge of effeminacy.</p>

<p class="indent">He was devoted to the fair sex; so much so, that the world
could not help giving him credit for being so sedulously attentive to the
beautification of his person solely that he might render himself
agreeable in their eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">He certainly succeeded most admirably; and, at the same time
that he was in all societies courted and caressed by the fairest and the
most distinguished, there was one little well-known theatrical connexion,
<i>of</i> which we will say as little as possible, and <i>to</i> which
old Mr. Miggins had alluded in his letter.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord John Lavender's income was small, his expectations minute,
his expenses great, and his debts amounted to his overplus expenditure
for the number of years he had been about town. Of the sum
total of his incumbrances he was ignorant. Bills came in at stated
periods, and were carelessly thrown aside; for what was the use of
looking at their amount, knowing beforehand that he could not pay
them? But he was aware this could not go on for ever; he knew
that, according to custom, tradesmen would trust him, as they constantly
trust others, almost to any amount, for a certain period, without
having from the first the slightest reason to suppose that the individual
so trusted would ever be in a condition to pay them; and then
all of a sudden they would pounce upon him, demand payment of all
arrears, and trust no more.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, it was quite impossible for Lord John to think of
retrenchment. Among the absolute necessaries of life he reckoned at least
two pair of primrose kid gloves a-day, at three shillings a-pair. Two
guineas a-week for gloves,&mdash;the price of a moderate bachelor's lodging!
Life would be intolerable without such things; so, in order that
he might continue in the land of the living, his fastidious lordship had
deigned to smile upon Miss Sophy Miggins, and had permitted the
idea of marriage with a plebeian to enter his aristocratic mind.</p>

<p class="indent">No wonder that Sophy should be dazzled by smiles from
such a quarter. She was pleased and flattered, and imagined that she liked
his lordship exceedingly, though she never felt at ease in his presence.
He was so unlike everybody with whom she had been accustomed to
associate, that she had sense enough to suppose she must be equally
unlike his former companions, and she was always afraid of exciting
his wonder and ridicule by some awkward breach of the usages of
good society. But then to walk about with a lord, was a thing not to
be resisted; and though she would have been much happier with the
Captain Mills of whom her father made honourable mention in his
letter to Lord John, still she never could bring herself to reject the
proffered arm of his lordship.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">And had she made up her mind to accept the <i>hand</i> of
Lord John Lavender, should that also in due course of time be proffered? Not
exactly; but Mrs. Miggins had decided for her. That his intentions
were honourable, she could not doubt. Honourable! nay, was he not
a <i>right</i> honourable lover? So, in full expectation of an offer for her
daughter, the old lady bought a "Peerage," placed it in a conspicuous
part of her drawing-room, and looked very coldly on Captain Mills.</p>

<p class="indent">The captain was ordered to Woolwich; and Lord John having left
Dover, Sophy could not, at parting, help evincing to poor Mills a little
of the partiality which she felt. Such was the position of affairs when
Mr. Miggins, who had no notion of men (nor lords neither) being
shilly shally, as he called it, was determined to bring matters to a
crisis. He therefore, after much serious cogitation, wrote the letter
which has been confidentially exhibited to the reader; and also another,
requiring infinitely less forethought, which he dispatched to
Captain Mills.</p>

<p class="indent">"What day of the month is it?" said Lord John to his valet,
after perusing the epistle of his Dover correspondent.</p>

<p class="indent">"The twenty-first, my lord."</p>

<p class="indent">"The twenty-first!" exclaimed his lordship finishing his
coffee.&mdash;"Wednesday, I declare!&mdash;and Sunday is Christmas-day! If I
go at all, I must go on Saturday at latest."</p>

<p class="indent">"My lord?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I must go to Dover, Friday or Saturday."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! on your way to the Continent?
I think it would be advisable, my lord."</p>

<p class="indent">"The Continent! no:&mdash;why advisable?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, my lord; <i>may</i> I speak?" inquired Faddle,
as he removed breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly: what have you to say?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, the tradespeople, my lord:&mdash;just at Christmas-time
the bills do fall in like a shower of paper-snow in a stage-play."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! and you think I must get out of the way, and let the
storm blow over, eh?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I do, indeed, my lord; for I'm sorry to say it's very threatening."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, well! we'll go as far as Dover; there's no occasion to
cross that odious channel."</p>

<p class="indent">"If I may make bold to ask, why will your lordship be safer at
Dover than in London?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't you remember that pretty girl, Faddle? the girl with
the rich father,&mdash;Miss Miggins?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! <i>marriage!</i>" said Faddle, with a very deep sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, Faddle, marriage."</p>

<p class="indent">"And here's a billet from May-fair!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! let me see;" and Lord John opened an elegant little note,
penned on a rose-leaf,&mdash;at least, in colour and fragrance it resembled one.</p>

<p class="indent">"She acts to-night, and desires me to dine with her on
Christmas-day. Leave me, Faddle. Give me pen, ink, and paper; send
me the <i>coiffeur</i> directly. I must speak to Tightfit's man at one;
appoint Heeltap at two, and Gimcrack and Shine a quarter of an hour later."</p>

<p class="indent">"To speak about their bills, my lord?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh dear, no; to elongate their bills. But <i>they</i> are too
distinguished in their respective lines to breathe a hint about the <i>trifles</i>.
As to the <i>canaille</i> of tradesmen, mention my intended marriage."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! it's settled?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, to be sure; you don't suppose
I've anything to do <i>but to go</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">The valet bowed, and left the noble lord to his meditations. At
three he was in his cab,&mdash;at five in May-fair,&mdash;at eight in the green-room.</p>

<p class="indent">Rapidly passed Thursday and Friday; and, among his many
preparations for departure on Saturday, Lord John forgot to write to
his future father-in-law, to intimate that it was his intention to depart.
No matter; they would only be the more delighted at his unexpected
arrival. Faddle packed up all his things; and, as his cambric
handkerchiefs and kid gloves entirely filled one portmanteau,
some notion may be formed of the quantity of luggage which it
was absolutely necessary for him to take.</p>

<p class="indent">All this, however, was despatched by the mail on Friday
night, directed to "Lord John Lavender, Worthington's Ship Hotel." On
Saturday morning, his lordship, accompanied by his faithful Faddle,
was to follow in a post-chariot and four. But Saturday morning came,
and with it came another rose-leaf, on which were lines so delicately
penned, that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Suffice it to say that Lord John Lavender postponed his
departure, dined in May-fair on Christmas-day, and, having resolved to travel
all night, ordered horses to be at the door at ten. He at length
tore himself away, wrapped himself up in several cloaks, threw himself
into a corner of the carriage, and fell fast asleep. Poor Faddle
in the rumble was most uncomfortably situated. It was no common
snow-storm that commenced on Christmas-night 1836, nor was it a
commonly keen wind that blew upon him. He shivered and shook,
muttering foul curses on May-fair; and very shortly became as white
as a sugar ornament on the exterior of a twelfth-cake, and very nearly
as inanimate. With much ado they reached Canterbury; their stopping
suddenly, roused Lord John Lavender from his repose. Somebody
tapped at the window, and most reluctantly he opened it.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you please, my lord, we can't go any further," stammered the
miserable and long-suffering Faddle.</p>

<p class="indent">"If <i>I</i> please! nonsense: horses out directly!"</p>

<p class="indent">"They say it's not possible, my lord: we've come through terrible
dangers as it is."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not possible! why not?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The snow, my lord."</p>

<p class="indent">"Snow! nonsense!&mdash;as if it never snowed before! Tell them who
I am. I say, you fellows, put horses to,&mdash;the distance is nothing;&mdash;go
on;" and Lord John pulled up the glass, threw himself again into
his corner, and the landlord, knowing that though they would inevitably
be obliged to return, the horses must be paid for, tipped the
postilion the wink, and on they went.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>But not to Dover!</i> Slowly they proceeded: now one
wheel was up in the air, and then the other. Lord John was himself startled
when he saw the deep drifts through which they waded; and when
at last they stopped at a low miserable hovel by the road-side, he no
longer urged the possibility of proceeding farther.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"We must return to Canterbury."</p>

<p class="indent">"Impossible, my lord: after we passed a part of the road which
had been cut between two hills, an immense mass of snow fell, and blocked
it up. It is a mercy it did not fall upon <i>us</i>;&mdash;we had a narrow escape."</p>

<p class="indent">"We <i>can't</i> stay here," said Lord John, looking at the wretched hut before him.</p>

<p class="indent">"We <i>must</i> stay here," said one of the drivers.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, I haven't got my things!&mdash;what can I do, Faddle, without
my things? I haven't even a clean cambric handkerchief, nor a tooth-brush!"</p>

<p class="indent">It was too true: it had appeared so easy to have his "<i>things</i>"
unpacked and placed on his dressing-table the moment he arrived at
Dover, that literally nothing had been provided. Intense cold soon
drove Lord John into the hut; from which, however, his first impulse
was to emerge again, so execrable were the fumes of bad tobacco,
and so odious the group which preoccupied the low chamber.</p>

<p class="indent">"Walk in and welcome," cried a tipsy waggoner; "we be all friends."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, faith!" said an Irish <i>lady</i>, whose husband, a
"needy knife-grinder," was asleep on the floor, "he's a rale gintleman, and I'll
give him a sate by myself, and p'raps he'll trate me to a drop of comfort."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord John felt exceedingly sick; and, choking with anger and tobacco-smoke,
he turned to the ragged lad of the house, and ordered a private room.</p>

<p class="indent">"There be no room, sir, but this here, besides that there up the ladder."</p>

<p class="indent">"Up there, then," said his lordship, approaching it.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, but ye can't though," said the lad interposing: "mother and
sister's asleep up there, and the waggoner's wife, and all the females
except she as sits there, by the fire."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord John paused; he could not invade the territory of the fair
sex: what was to be done?</p>

<p class="indent">"Can't I have a bed?"</p>

<p class="indent">"There <i>be</i> some dry straw left, I take it: I'll go and see,
and give you a shake down here, and welcome."</p>

<p class="indent">"A shake down!" groaned his lordship, "Faddle!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where are you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Here&mdash;dying, I believe; I never was so ill!" and there
in truth lay Faddle, rolling on the bare floor.</p>

<p class="indent">"I say, Mother Murphy," said the tipsy Waggoner,
"that ere chap's a lord!"</p>

<p class="indent">"They be going to do away wi' them, I hear," said the Radical
knife-grinder, waking up; "and a good job too;&mdash;werry useless fellors, I take it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Bless his pretty face!" said the Irish lady: "exchange is no
robbery; and I'd gi' him a kiss for a drop of the cratur."</p>

<p class="indent">"You be hung!" cried her husband, throwing a stool at her head;
"you've had too much already."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The fair representative of Hibernia was not to be put upon; up
she started, and there was a pitched battle between her and her husband,
which ended in the fall of both.</p>

<p class="indent">Unused to fatigue, Lord John at last threw himself on his straw.
But what a night did he pass! the noise, the smell, the discomfort, the fleas&mdash;oh!</p>

<p class="indent">By many will the last week of 1836 be long remembered, but by
none with greater horror than by the Right Honourable Lord John Lavender.</p>

<p class="indent">Without wholesome food,&mdash;without a change of linen,&mdash;
exposed to cold, privation, and every possible annoyance, he became seriously
unwell; and when, at the end of a week, the indefatigable Mr. Worthington
opened a communication between Dover and Canterbury
by means of a sledge, the poor prisoner was unable to avail himself
of it. Some comforts and necessary restoratives were, however,
conveyed to him; and at the end of another week, after the road had
been traversed by many, four horses were again put to his carriage,
and, entering it like the shadow of his former self, he once more
started on his way to Dover. We have said that there is a great
advantage in having begun to "<i>make up</i>" early in life. Not so,
however, when the process has been suddenly and unavoidably interrupted.
But Lord John was sure to find all he wanted as soon as
he arrived at the Ship Hotel; a few hours' renovation would prepare
him for his interview with the fair Sophy. He threw himself back in
the carriage, and indulged in the most gratifying anticipations.</p>

<p class="indent">He was roused from his reverie by the rapid approach of a chariot
and four greys; and, leaning forward, he caught a glimpse of Sophy,&mdash;the
lovely, amiable Sophy,&mdash;who, having heard of his dilemma, had,
doubtless, set out to seek him!</p>

<p class="indent">"Stop! stop!" cried Lord John. "Here, Faddle, get down; call
to those drivers. Hollo there!&mdash;open the door&mdash;let down the step&mdash;give
me your arm&mdash;that will do: I'm delighted to see you, Sophy;
I recognised you in a minute: I was on my way to Dover to pay my
respects."</p>

<p class="indent">Sophy blushed, and smiled, and did not seem to know what to say:
at last she articulated,</p>

<p class="indent">"Papa and mamma will be happy to see you, my lord: allow me
to introduce to your lordship my husband, Captain Mills;" and a gentleman
leaned forward and bowed, who had before been invisible.</p>

<p class="indent">"Your lordship will be in time for the wedding-dinner; you will
have the kindness to say you have seen us."</p>

<p class="indent">Saying thus, Captain Mills and <i>his lady</i> again bowed and smiled;
and, leaving his lordship in amazement, the wedding equipage dashed on.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord John Lavender proceeded to Dover, and, looking into
some Sunday chronicle of fashionable scandal, he saw that his friend of
May-fair had just entered into another <i>arrangement</i>. His case was
desperate; and, accompanied only by his valet, he proceeded on what
lords and gentlemen so circumstanced, call, a <i>Continental trip</i>.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">They who choose to read a document on a certain
church-door, may ascertain, that though no Robin Hood,
the Right Honourable Lord John Lavender is an outlaw.

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Friend Bentley</span>,&mdash;I see you have got
hold of some of our family secrets; but Seaforth was always a blab. No matter: as you
<i>have</i> found your way into our circle, why, I suppose we must even make
the best of it, and let you go on. The revival of "Old Sir Giles's"
story has set us all rummaging among the family papers, of which
there is a large chest full "apud <i>castro</i> de Tappington," as a literary
friend of mine has it. In the course of her researches, Caroline the
other day popped upon the history of a far-off cousin, some four or
five generations back,&mdash;a sad story,&mdash;a sort of Uriah business,&mdash;in
which a principal part was played by a great-great-aunt of ours. In
order to secure her own child's succession to a fair estate, she was
always believed to have wantonly exposed the life of her husband's
only son by a former marriage; and through the assistance of her brother,
a sea-captain, to have at least thrust him unnecessarily into
danger, even if their machinations went no farther. The lad was
killed; and report said that an old boatswain confessed on his
death-bed&mdash;But Miss Simpkinson will tell you the story better than I
can. She has dished it up for you in her choicest Pindarics; and though
the maiden is meek, her muse is masculine.</p>

<p class="f90">BY THE OLD SAILOR.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="f110">THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">For the purple Nautilus is my boat,</span>
<span class="i18">In which I over the waters float;</span>
<span class="i18">The moon is shining upon the sea.</span>
<span class="i18">Who is there will come and sail with me?&mdash;L.E.L.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Of all the craft that ever swam upon salt-water give me the
dashing forty-four gun frigate, with a ship's company of dare-devils who
would board his Satanic Majesty's kitchen in the midst of cooking-time,
if they could only get a gallant spirit to lead them. And pray,
what would a ship's company be without leaders? for, after all, it is
the officers that make the men what they are; so that, when I see a
well-rigged man-o'-war, in which discipline is preserved without
unnecessary punishment or toil, that's the hooker for me; and such was
his Britannic Majesty's frigate, "the saucy, thrash-'em-all <span class="smcap">Spankaway</span>,"
for by that title was she known from Yarmouth Roads to the
Land's End. Oh, she was a lovely creature! almost a thing of life!
and it would be outraging the principles of beauty to give her any
other than a female designation. Everybody has been in love some
time or other in the course of his existence, and the object of affection
was no doubt an angel in the eyes of the ardent lover:&mdash;just so was
the frigate to me&mdash;an angel; for she had wings, and her movements
were regulated by the breath of heaven. She was the very standard
of loveliness, the most exquisite of graceful forms. At anchor she
sat upon the water with all the elegance and ease of the cygnet, or
like a queen reclining on her downy couch. Under weigh she resembled
the pretty pintado bird skimming the billow tops, or the fleet
dolphin darting from wave to wave. Then to see her climb the rolling
swell, or cleave the rising foam, baptising her children with the
spray, and naming them her seamen&mdash;Oh, it was a spectacle worth a
life to witness!</p>

<p class="indent">And who was her captain? the intrepid Lord Eustace Dash; a
man more ennobled by his acts than by the courtesy which conferred
his title; one who loved the women, hated the French, and had a
constitutional liking for the rattling reports of a long-eighteen. His
first lieutenant, Mr. Seymour, knew his duty, and performed it. The
second lieutenant, Mr. Sinnitt, followed the example of his senior.
The third lieutenant, Mr. Nugent, obeyed orders, touched the guitar,
and was extremely anxious to become an author. Then there was
Mr. Scalpel, the surgeon; Mr. Squeez'em, the purser; and Mr. Parallel,
the master; with the two marine officers, Plumstone and Peabody.
Such were the <i>élite</i> of the frigate; but it would be unpardonable&mdash;a
sort of sea-sacrilege&mdash;not to notice Mr. Savage, the boatswain;
Mr. Blueblazes, the gunner; and Mr. Bracebit, the carpenter,
all good men and true, who had come in at the hawse-holes, and served
through the various gradations till they mounted the anchor-button
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
on their long-tailed coats. As for the mates, midshipmen, and
assistant-surgeons, there was a very fair sprinkling,&mdash;the demons of the
orlop, each with his nickname. Her crew&mdash;but we will speak of them presently.</p>

<p class="indent">Hark! it is four bells, in the first dog-watch; and there rolls
the summons by the drum, calling the brave to arms. See how the hatchways
pour forth the living mass! and in three minutes every soul fore
and aft is at his appointed post. The gallant ship lies almost slumbering
on the fair bosom of the waters, and the little progress she
does make is as noiseless as a delightful dream; like the lone point in
the centre of a circle, she is surrounded by the blue waves, and nothing
intervenes to break the connected curve of the horizon. Upon
the quarter-deck, his right hand thrust into his waistcoat, and his feet
firmly planted on the white plank, as if desirous of making the bark
feel his own peculiar weight, stands her brave commander: near him
Mr. Squeez'em and two young imps of aides-de-camp take up their
allotted stations; the former to note and minute down the details of
action, the latter to fly to the infernal regions of the magazine,or
anywhere else, at the bidding of their chief. The lieutenants are
mustering their divisions through the agency of the young gentlemen; the
surgeon and his assistants, happily having nothing to do below, appear
abaft the mizen-mast; whilst Mr. Parallel holds brief consultation
with the veteran Savage, whose portrait is affixed to each cat-head.
Mr. Bracebit is sounding the well, and old Blueblazes is skimming
about wherever circumstances require his presence. The marines,
stiffened with pipe-clay, and their heads immoveable from what the
negroes appropriately call "a top-boot round de neck," are parading
on the gangway&mdash;their thumbs as stark as tobacco-stoppers, and their
fingers as straight as a "hap'orth of pins." What a compound of pomatum
and heel-ball, pipe-clay and sand-paper!</p>

<p class="indent">And now the officers give in their reports to the captain,
who walks round the quarters to make a personal inspection, and, as he looks
along the frowning battery, his lordship is proud of his bonny bark;
whilst, as he gazes on his gallant crew, his heart exults in beholding
some of the finest specimens of Britain's own that ever made their
"home upon the deep."</p>

<p class="indent">"What think you of the weather, Mr. Parallel?" inquires his
lordship, on returning to the quarter-deck. "Will it be fine to-night?"</p>

<p class="indent">The old man scans the horizon with an eye of professional
scrutiny, and then replies, "I have my doubts, my lord; but at this time o'
year the helements are beyond the ken of human understanding.
I've been up the Mediterranean, off and on, man and boy, some five-and-forty
years; it is to me like the face of a parent to a child, but I
never could discover from its features what was passing in its heart,
or the fit it would take next; one minute a calm, the next a squall;
one hour a gentle breeze that just keeps the sails asleep, the next a
gale of wind enough to blow the devil's horns off."</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Eustace well knows the veteran's peculiarities; indeed
he is the only privileged talker in the ship, and so much esteemed by all,
that no one seeks to check his loquacity.</p>

<p class="indent">"Beat the retreat, and reef the topsails, Mr. Seymour," cries
the captain to his first lieutenant, and the latter despatches one of the
young gentlemen to repeat the orders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Rub-a-dub goes the drum again; but before the sound of
the last tap has died away, the twhit-twhit of the boatswain's call summons
his mates to their duty; a loud piping succeeds, and "Reef topsails
ahoy!" is bellowed forth from lungs that might have been cased with
sheet-iron, so hoarse is the appeal. And see! before you can slue
round to look, from the tack of the flying-jib to the outer clue of the
spanker, the lower rattlins of the fore, main, and mizen shrouds are
thronged with stout active young men, who keep stealthily ascending,
till the first lieutenant's "Away aloft!" sends them up like sparks from
a chimney-pot. The topsails are lowered, the studding-sail booms are
triced up, the topmen mount the horses, the earings are hauled out,
the reef-points tied, the sails rehoisted, and the men down on deck
again in one minute and fifty-two seconds from the moment the halliards
first rattled from the rack.</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well done, Mr. Seymour!" exclaims his lordship, as he
stands near the wheel, with his gold repeater in his hand; "and cleverly
reefed too: those after-points are well taut, and show as straight
a line as if it had been ruled by a schoolmaster."</p>

<p class="indent">"Natur's their schoolmaster, my lord," says old Parallel, with a
pleased and business-like countenance; "and, consequently, they have
everything well taut."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very good, master," exclaimed his lordship, laughing, "you get
more witty than ever."</p>

<p class="indent">"It's strange," muttered the veteran, surlily, "that I can't
speak a simple truth, without their logging it down again' me for wit. For
my part I see no wit in it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Pipe the hammocks down, Mr. Seymour; give them half an hour,
and then call the watch," orders his lordship.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, ay, sir!" responds the first lieutenant.
"Stand by the hammocks, Mr. Savage."</p>

<p class="indent">"Twhit-twhit!" goes the boatswain's call, followed by a
voice like a distant thunderclap, "Hammocks ahoy!" and away flies every man
to the nettings; but not a lashing is touched till the whole have
found owners, (the occupation of a minute,) when the first lieutenant's
"Pipe down!" draws forth a lark-like chirping of the calls, and in a
few seconds the whole have disappeared; even the hammock-men to
the young gentlemen have fetched their duplicate, and the cloths are
rolled up for the night. The gallant Nelson had his coffin publicly
exhibited in his cabin; but what of that? the seaman constantly sleeps
in his coffin, for such is his hammock should he die at sea.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Eustace has retired to his cabin, and the officers
are pacing to and fro the quarter-deck, conversing on</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6em;">"Promotion, mess-debts, absent friends, and love."</p>

<p class="indent">The glory of the day is on the wane; the full round moon
arises bright and beautiful, like a gigantic pearl from the coral caverns of
the ocean; but there is a sort of sallow mistiness upon the verge of
the western horizon, tinged with vermeil streaks from the last rays of
the setting sun, that produce feelings of an undefined and undefinable
nature: yet there is nothing threatening, for all is delightfully tranquil;
no cloud appears to excite apprehensions, for there is a smile
upon the face of the heavens, and its dimples are reflected on the
surface of the clear waters as assurances of safety. Yet, why are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
there many keen and experienced eyes glancing at that sickly aspect
of the west, as if it were something which tells them of sudden squalls,
of whirling hurricanes, like the unnatural flush that gives warning of
approaching fever.</p>

<p class="indent">"The captain will be happy to have the company of the gun-room
officers, to wind up the day, sir," said his lordship's steward, addressing
the first lieutenant.</p>

<p class="indent">"The gun-room officers, much obliged, will wait upon his
lordship," returned Mr. Seymour; then, turning to Mr. Parallel, "Come, master;
what attracts your attention there to windward? The captain
has sent us an invitation to take our grog with him. Are you
ready?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, ay!" responded the old man, "with pleasure; his
lordship means to make Saturday night of it, I suppose; and I must own it
has been a precious long week, though, according to the log, it's ounly Thursday."</p>

<p class="indent">The cabin of Lord Eustace had nothing splendid about it; the
guns were secured by the tackles, ready for instant use, and everything
was plain and simple; the deck was carpeted, and the furniture,
handsome of its kind, more suited for utility than show. The baize-covered
table was amply supplied with wines, spirits, and liquors,
which his lordship prided himself in never having but of the best
quality; and a jovial party sat around to enjoy the invigorating cheer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Gentlemen," said his lordship, rising, "The King!"</p>

<p class="indent">Heartily was that toast drunk, for never was monarch more
affectionately served by his royal navy than George the Third. Other
toasts were given, national and characteristic songs were sung; the
relaxation of discipline loosened the restraints on harmony, and that
kindly feeling prevailed which forms the best bond of union amongst
the officers, and commands respect and esteem from the men.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, Mr. Nugent, have you nothing new to give us? no fresh
effusion of the muse?" enquired his lordship.</p>

<p class="indent">"As for any thing fresh," said old Parallel, "I know he puts
us all into a pretty pickle with his 'briny helement,' and in his 'salt-sea
sprays,' everlasting spouting like a fin-back at play; what with him
and the marines' flutes I suffer a sort of cable-laid torture."</p>

<p class="indent">"You've no taste for poetry, master," returned the young
officer: "but come, I'll give you my last song; Plumstone has set it to
music;" and with a clear sonorous voice he sang the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And he will prove, where'er it flies, we're sovereigns of the sea."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">"Very fair, very fair, Mr. Nugent," said his lordship; "and not
badly sung, either."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, ay, my lord, the youngster's well enough," chimed in old
Parallel; "but, what with his poetry and book-making, I'm half afraid
he'll forget the traverse-tables altogether."</p>

<p class="indent">"And pray how does the book-making, as the master calls it, get
on, Nugent?" inquired the captain: "have you made much progress?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have commenced, my lord," returned the junior lieutenant,
pulling out some papers from his pocket; "and, with your lordship's
permission&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"You'll inflict it upon us," grumbled the old master, and
shrugging up his shoulders as he perceived his messmate was actually about
to read, whether the captain sanctioned it or not.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now then, attention to my introduction!" said Nugent, holding
up the manuscript, heedless of the nods and winks of his companions;
"I'm sure you'll like it. 'The moon is high in the mid heavens,
and not a single envious cloud frowns darkly upon her fair loveliness;
there is a flood of silvery light; and fleecy vapours, with their hoary
crests, like snow-wreaths from the mountain top, float on its surface
to do honour to the queen of night. The winds are sporting with the
waters; the amorous waves are heaving up their swelling bosoms to
be kissed by the warm breeze that comes laden with perfumes from
the sunny clime of Italy. There is a glow of crimson lingering in
the west, as if departing day blushed for her wanton sister. Hail,
thou inland sea, upon whose breast the gallant heroes of the British
isles have fought and conquered! Ancient history recounts thy days
of old, and the bold shores that bind thee in their arms stand as
indubitable records of the truth of Holy Writ. The tall ship, reflected
on thy ocean mirror, seems to view her symmetry in silent exultation,
as if conscious of her grandeur and her beauty, her majesty and her
might. The giantess of the deep, her lightnings sleeping and her
thunders hushed, dances lightly o'er thy mimic billows, and curtseys
to the gentle gale.' There, my lord, that is the way I begin: and I
appeal to your well-known judgment whether it is not a pretty picture,
and highly poetical."</p>

<p class="indent">"A pretty picture truly," grumbled old Parallel: "it ounly
wants a squadron of angels seated with their bare starns upon the wet
clouds, scudding away before it like colliers in the Sevin, and in one
corner the heads of a couple o' butcher's boys blowing wooden skewers,
and then it would be complete. Why, there's the marine
a-laughing at you. Talk about the winds kissing the waves, indeed.
Ay, ay, young sir, when you've worked as many reckonings as ould
Will Parallel,&mdash;and that's myself,&mdash;you'll find 'em kiss somat else,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
or you'll have better luck than your neighbours. Why don't you
stick to Natur, if you mean to write a book? and how'll the log
stand then?&mdash;Why, His Majesty's ship Spankaway cruising in the
Mediterranean: and if you've worked your day's work, you ought to
know the latitude and longitude. Well, there she is, with light winds
and fine weather, under double-reefed top-sels, jib, and spanker, the
courses snugly hauled up, the t'gant-sels furled in a skin as smooth
as an infant's, the staysels nicely stowed, and not a yard of useless
canvass abroad. There'd be some sense in that, and everybody would
understand it; but as for your kissing and blushing, and such like
stuff, why it's all nonsense."</p>

<p class="indent">"That's always the way with you matter-o'-fact men," retorted
the lieutenant: "you make no allowance for the colourings of the imagination;
your ideas of the picturesque never go beyond the ship's paint."</p>

<p class="indent">"But they do, though, my young friend," asseverated the master,
to the great amusement of all present. "Show me the ship's paint
that can compare with the ruby lustre of this fine old port&mdash;here's a
discharge of grape."</p>

<p class="indent">"That's a metaphor, master," said the purser; "and,
moreover,"&mdash;and he seemed to shudder at the abomination,&mdash;"it is a pun."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, ay," answered the veteran, holding up his glass to the
light, and eyeing its contents with evident satisfaction, "we've often met
afore; and as for the pun, I'll e'en swallow it;" and he drank off his
wine amidst a general laugh. "But do you really mean to write a
book, Nugent?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I do, indeed, master," answered the lieutenant; "but whether
it will be read or not is an affair for others to determine. I've got as
far as I have repeated to you, and must now pick up incidents and characters."</p>

<p class="indent">"A bundle of shakings and a head-rope of wet swabs!" uttered
the old master contemptuously. "Stick to your log-book, Mr. Nugent,
if ever you hopes to get command of such a sweet craft as this here,
of which I have the honour to be the master. Larn to keep the
ship's reck'ning, and leave authorship to the poor devils who starves
by it. There's ounly two books as ever I look at&mdash;Hamilton Moore
and the Bible; and though I never yet sailed in a craft that rated a
parson in commission, yet I make out the latter tolerably well,
notwithstanding my edication sometimes gets jamm'd in a clinch, and my
knowledge thrown slap aback: but that's all nat'ral; for how can a
man work to wind'ard through a narrow passage without knowing
somut o' the soundings or the outline o' the coast. Howsomever,
there's one course as is plain enough, and I trust it will carry me
clear at last,&mdash;to do my duty by my king, God bless him!&mdash;and whilst
the yards of conscience are squared by the lifts and braces of honesty,
I have no fear but I shall cheat the devil of one messmate, and that's
ould Will&mdash;myself."</p>

<p class="indent">"A toast, gentlemen&mdash;a toast!" exclaimed his lordship
in high animation; "'The master of the Spankaway and his lady-mate.'"</p>

<p class="indent">"I beg pardon, my lord," interrupted the surgeon,
"the master is not married; he is yet a solitary bachelor."</p>

<p class="indent">"True&mdash;most true," chimed in Nugent, laughing; "for,
according to the words of the poet,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6em;">"None but himself can be his
<span class="smcap">PARALLEL</span>."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"You are too fastidious, gentlemen," said his lordship:
"remember, it is 'Wives and sweethearts;' and, as it is a favourite toast of
mine, we will, if you please, drink it standing." The toast was drunk
with all due honours. "And now," continued his lordship, "without
further preface, I shall volunteer a song, which Nugent may hoist
into his book, if he pleases.</p>

<p class="indent">As in duty bound, this song elicited great applause, and
Nugent declared he should most certainly avail himself of his lordship's
proposal for inserting it in his book. "But you have done nothing, Mr.
Nugent," said the captain. "You say you want incident and character.
You have already taken the frigate for your text;&mdash;there's
the master now, a perfect character."</p>

<p class="indent">"For the love of good old port," exclaimed Parallel, as if
alarmed, "let me beg of you not to gibbet me in your consarn. But I'm not
afraid of it; book-making requires some head-piece; there's nothing
to be done without a head, nor ever has been."</p>

<p class="indent">"I must differ with you there, Mr. Parallel," said Seymour
unobtrusively; "for I myself saw a very difficult thing done
literally without a head.</p>

<p class="indent">"Galvanised, I suppose," uttered the doctor in a tone of inquiry;
"the power of the battery is wonderful."</p>

<p class="indent">"There assuredly was a battery, doctor," responded the lieutenant,
laughing; "and a very heavy one too. But the event I'm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
speaking of had no connexion with galvanism: it was sheer muscular motion."</p>

<p class="indent">"Out with it, Seymour!"&mdash;"Let's have it by all
means!"&mdash;"It will be an incident for Nugent!"&mdash;"Out with it!"
burst forth simultaneously from all.</p>

<p class="indent">"It certainly is curious," said the first lieutenant, assuming
much gravity of countenance, "and happened when I was junior luff of the
old Sharksnose. We were running into Rio Janeiro man-o'-war
fashion, with a pennant as long as a purser's account at the masthead,
and a spanking ensign hoisted at the gaff-end, with a fly that
would have swept all the sheep off of the Isle of Wight. Away we
gallop'd along, when a shot from Santa Cruz, the three-deck'd battery
at the entrance, came slap into our bows. 'Tell him we're
pretty well, thanky,' shouted the skipper; and our jolly first, who
took his meaning, literally pointed the fokstle gun, clapp'd the match
to the priming, and off went the messenger, which struck the sentry,
who was pacing his post, right between the shoulders, and whipt off
his head as clean as you would snap a carrot; he was a stout-made
powerful-looking man, and by sheer muscular motion, as I said before,
his head flew up from his body at least a fathom and a half, and
actually descended upon the point of his bayonet, where it stuck fast,
and the unfortunate fellow walked the whole length of the rampart in
that way; nor was it till he got to the turn, and was steering round
to come back again, that he discovered the loss of his head, when,
according to the most approved practice in similar surgical cases, he
fell to the ground. It was sheer muscular motion, gentlemen,&mdash;sheer
muscular motion."</p>

<p class="indent">"He would, no doubt, have been a good mussulman, Seymour, if
he had been a Turk," said his lordship.</p>

<p class="indent">"He couldn't come the right-about face," said Peabody, "having
lost his head. It would have been a comical sight to have seen him
present arms; pray did he come to the present?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, nor yet to the recover, I'll be sworn," observed Plumstone;
"no doubt he grounded his arms and his head too."</p>

<p class="indent">"Them chance shots often do the most mischief," remarked
Parallel. "Who would have thought that it would have gone right
through his chest, so as to leave him a headless trunk. Pray may I
ax you whether he was near his box?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well hove and strong, master," exclaimed Sinnitt,
joining in the general laugh; "your wit equals your beauty."</p>

<p class="indent">"What have I said that's witty now?" returned the veteran;
"I can't open my mouth to utter a word of truth, or to ax a question,
but I'm called a wit; for my part, I see no wit in it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Your anecdote," said his lordship, "reminds me of something
similar that I witnessed, when a youngster, at one of the New Zealand
Isles. Our captain took a party of us to see his dun-coloured
majesty at court. The monarch was seated in a mud, or rather clay
building, nearly in a state of nudity, his only covering being an old
uniform coat and a huge cocked-hat: his queens&mdash;happy man! I
think he had seventy&mdash;not quite so decently dressed as himself, were
squatting, or lying down, in different directions; several of them with
such ornaments through their lips and noses, as would have answered
the purpose of rings in the decks to a stopper'd best bower cable. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
heartily wish some of our court ladies could have seen this royal
spectacle. We were ushered in through an entrance, on each side of
which was a pile of heads without tails to them, most probably dropped
in their hurry to wait upon the king. His majesty was a man of
mild countenance, and of most imperturbable gravity; behind him
stood a gigantic-looking rascal, with an enormous dragoon's sabre
over his shoulder, by way of warning to his majesty's wives not
to disturb his majesty's repose, or it was amongst the chances of
royalty that he would shorten their bodies and their days at the
same moment,&mdash;a sort of summary process to make good women
of them; and I began to suspect that some of those which we saw
at the entrance had once touched noses with his most disgusting
majesty,&mdash;for a filthier fellow I never set eyes on. You've, no
doubt, seen some of those curiously figured heads which grow upon
New Zealand shoulders, for many have been brought to England:
our skipper, who was a sort of collector of curiosities, was extremely
desirous of obtaining one, but he was aware that it was only
the head men who were thus marked or tattooed, and he had run
his eye over the samples at the doorway, but could not detect one
chief who had been deprived of his caput. Nevertheless, by signs
and through means of a Scotch interpreter, (for the prime minister
to Longchewfishcow was a Scotchman,) his majesty was informed of
the captain's wish; and in a short time several natives handsomely
tattooed were drawn up within the building: the skipper was requested
to select the figures which pleased him most; and he, imagining
that the chiefs had been exhibited merely by way of pattern,
fixed upon one whose features appeared to have had pricked off upon
them every day's run of the children of Israel when cruising in the
wilderness. The chief bowed in token of satisfaction at being thus
highly honoured; but, before he could raise his head, it sprang away
from his shoulders into the captain's arms, with thanks for the
compliment yet passing from the lips:&mdash;the life-guardsman of the king
had obeyed his majesty's signal, and the dragoon's sabre had made
sharp work of it."</p>

<p class="indent">"It was quick and dead," said the old master. "Now,
Mr. Nugent, you may begin your book as soon as you please. I'm sure you
have plenty of heads to work upon."</p>

<p class="indent">"You talk as if I had no head of my own, master," retorted
the lieutenant, somewhat offended; "and with all your wit you shall find
that I have got a head."</p>

<p class="indent">"So has a scupper-nail," returned the veteran, "but it
requires a deal of hammering before you can get it to the leather."</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-humour, gentlemen! good-humour!" said the captain,
laughing; "no recriminations, if you please, or we shall bring some
of your heads to the block."</p>

<p class="indent">"To make blockheads of 'em, I suppose," observed old Parallel;
"by every rope in the top, but that's done already! Howsomever,
as you are lecturing upon heads, why I'll just relate an anecdote of a
circumstance that I was eyewitness to upwards of thirty years ago.
I was then just appointed acting-master of the 'Never-so-quick,' one
o' your ould ship sloops; and we were cruising in among the West
Ingee islands, but more especially boxing about the island of Cuba,
and that way, for pirates. Well, one morning at daybreak the look-out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
had just got upon the foretopsel-yard, when word was passed that
there were two sail almost alongside of each other, and dead down to
looard of us. There was a nice little breeze, and so we ups stick,
squares the yards, and sets the stud'nsels a both sides, to run down
and overhaul the strangers, though we made pretty certain it was a
pirate plundering a capture; and we was the more convinced of the
fact when broad daylight came, and our glasses showed that one of
'em was a long low schooner, just such a one as the picarooning marauders
risk'd their necks in, and certainly better judges of a swift
craft never dipp'd their hands in a tar-bucket. She saw us a-coming,
and away she pay'd off before the wind, and up went a squaresel of
light duck that dragg'd the creatur along beautifully. The other
craft, a large brig, lay quite still with her maintopsel to the mast,
except that she came up and fell off as if her helm was lash'd a-lee,
Now the best point of the ould Never-so-quick's sailing was right
afore it, and so we not only held our own, but draw'd upon the vagabond
thief that was doing his best to slip his head out of a hangman's
noose, when it fell stark calm, the brig lying about midway between
his Majesty's ship and the devil's own schooner. Out went her
sweeps, and out went our boats; but she altered her course to get
in shore, and without a breath of wind they swept her along at the
rate of four knots and a half, whilst our ould beauty would hardly
move; so the captain recalls the boats, and orders 'em to overhaul
the brig. We got alongside about noon, a regular wasting burning
hot noon; and we found a hand cut off at the wrist grasping one of
the main-chain plates, so that it could hardly be disengaged."</p>

<p class="indent">"Muscular power!" said Seymour; "the death-grapple,
no doubt! astonishing tenacity notwithstanding."</p>

<p class="indent">"Howsomever, we did open the fingers," continued the master,
"and found by its delicate whiteness, and a ring on the wedding-finger,
that it belonged to a woman. When we got on board, the
blood in various parts of the quarter-deck, and at the gangways, indicated
the murderous tragedy that had been acted; but no semblance
of human being could we find except a head,&mdash;a bloody head that
seemed to have been purposely placed upon a flour-cask that was upended
near the windlass. 'Well, I'm bless'd,' says one of our boasun's-mates,
who had steered the pinnace,&mdash;'I'm bless'd if they arn't
shaved you clean enough at any rate; but d&mdash;my tarry trousers, look
at that!&mdash;why then I'm a Dutchman if it arn't winking at me.'&mdash;'Bathershin!'
says an Irish topman, 'it's stretching his daylights he
is, mightily plased to see such good company;' and sure enough the
eyes were rolling about in a strange fashion for a head as had no
movables to consort to it; and presently the mouth opened wide, and
then the teeth snap'd to again, just like a cat-fish at St. Jago's. 'It's
a horrible sight,' said one of the cutters, 'and them fellows'll go to
&mdash;&mdash; for it, that's one consolation; but ain't it mighty queer, sir,
that a head without ever a body should be arter making such wry
faces, and opening and shutting his sallyport, seeing as he's scratched
out of his mess?' A hideous grin distorted every feature,&mdash;so hideous
that it made me shudder; and first one eye and then the other opened
in rapid succession. 'I say, Jem,' says one of the pinnaces to the
boasun's-mate,&mdash;'I say, Jem, mayhap the gentleman wants a bit o' pig-tail,
for most likely he arn't had a chaw since he lost his 'bacca-box.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
This sally, with the usual recklessness of seamen, produced a
general laugh, which emboldened Jem to take out his quid, and,
watching an opportunity, he claps it into between the jaws; but before
he could gather in the slack of his arm, the teeth were fast hold of
his fingers, and there he was, jamm'd like Jackson, and roaring out
ten thousand murders. He tried to snatch his hand away, but the
head held on to the cask like grim death against the doctor; at last
away it roll'd over and Jem got clear, but the head stuck fast, and
then we discovered that there was a body inside. The head of the
cask had been taken out, and a hole cut hardly large enough to admit
of the poor fellow's neck; but nevertheless it had been hoop'd up
again, and when we got on board he was in the last convulsive gasps
of strangulation. We released him immediately, but it was only to
find him so shockingly mutilated that he died in about ten minutes
afterwards; and not a soul was left to tell us the fatal tale, though
from an ensign and some shreds of papers we conjectured the brig
was a Spaniard. The pirates had scuttled her. She made water
too fast to think of saving her, and in a couple of hours she went
down."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thankye, master, thankye," exclaimed several; "why we
shall have you writing a book before long, and you'll beat Nugent out and
out. See, he's ready to yield the palm."</p>

<p class="indent">"Him!" uttered the old man, with a look expressive of
rather more contempt than the young lieutenant merited. "Him!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, master," said Nugent, "we <i>must</i>
have your song,&mdash;it is your turn next."</p>

<p class="indent">"So it appears," replied the old man, as the frigate
suddenly heeled over. "You have had so much singing that even the winds
must have a <i>squall</i>." They were rising hastily from their seats,
when in an instant the frigate was nearly thrown on her beam-ends.
Away went Parallel right over the table into the stomach of the
marine Peabody, whom he capsized; and before another moment
elapsed the gallant captain and his officers were scrambling between
the guns to leeward, and half buried in water, amidst broken decanters
and glasses, sea-biscuit and bottles. Old Parallel grasped a decanter
of port that was clinking its sides against a ring-bolt, and, unwilling
that so much good stuff should be wasted, clapped the mouth
to his own; the purser was fishing for his wig, as he was extremely
tenacious on the score of his bald head; the captain and Seymour
were trying for the door; the doctor got astride one gun, and the two
marine officers struggled for the other, so that as fast as one got hold
his messmate unhorsed him again. Sinnitt had crawled up to the
table, and Nugent twisted his coat-laps round him to preserve his
MS. from becoming saturated. The frigate righted again. His
lordship and his lieutenants rushed on deck, to behold the three
topmasts, with all their lengths of upper spars, hanging over the side,
having in a white squall been snapped short off by the caps. We
will leave them in the present to</p>

<h2>REMAINS OF HAJJI BABA.</h2>

<p class="indent">It appears that Hajji Baba, the Persian adventurer,
known in this country as the author of certain memoirs, is no more. In
what particular manner he quitted this world, we have not been
able to ascertain; but, through the kindness of a friend recently
returned from the East, we have been put in possession of the
fragment of a Journal written by him, by which we learn that
he once again visited England (although incog.) some time after
the passing of the Reform bill. The view which he, his Shah,
and his nation, took of that event, is so characteristic of the
ignorance in which Eastern people live in matters relative to Europe,
and to England in particular, that we deem ourselves fortunate
in being able to lay so curious a document before our
readers, and shall take the liberty, from time to time, to insert
portions of it, until it be entirely exhausted.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="indent">Since my return from Frangistan, the current of my
existence flowed more like the waters of a canal than those of a river. I
have been allowed to smoke the pipe of tranquillity, rested upon
the carpet of content; and as my duties, which principally consisted
in standing before the king at stated times, and saying
"<i>Belli</i>&mdash;Yes," and "<i>Mashallah</i>&mdash;Praise be to God!" at
proper intervals, I could not complain of the weight of responsibility
imposed upon me.</p>

<p class="indent">I lived in the smallest of houses, consisting of one
room, a shoe closet, and a small court; also of a kitchen. My principal
amusement was to sit in my room and look into my court-yard,
and, as one must think, my thoughts frequently would run upon
my travels, upon the strange things which I had seen, and upon
the individuals with whom I had become acquainted. My heart
would soften as it dwelt upon the charms of the moon-faced
Bessy, and would rouse into anger when I reflected that she was
possessed by the infidel Figsby, at a time that she might have
been the head of the harem of a true believer. I frequently recalled
to myself all the peculiarities of the strange nation with
which I had lived, and compared it with my own. I brought
to mind all its contrivances to be happy, its House of Commons
and its House of Lords, its eternal quarrels, its cryings
after "justice and no justice," and its dark climate. I read
over my journals, and thus lived my life over again; but in
proportion as years passed away, so I thought it right, in relating
my adventures to my countrymen, to diminish the most
wonderful parts of my narrative, for I found that, had I not done
so, I should have been set down as the greatest liar in Persia.
Truth cannot be told at all times,&mdash;that is a common saying;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
but now I found, in what regarded the Francs, that truth ought
never to be told. When, on my return to Persia, I informed my
countrymen that their men and women lived together promiscuously,&mdash;that
everybody drank wine and ate pork,&mdash;that they
never prayed,&mdash;that their kings danced, and that they had no
harems, I was believed, because I had many to confirm what I
said; but now that I stood alone, I found it would not do to
venture such assertions, for whenever I did I was always told
that such events might have taken place when I was in Frangistan,
but that now Allah was great, and that the holy Prophet
could not allow such abominations to exist.</p>

<p class="indent">The news of the death of the King of England, to
whom I had been presented, had reached the ears of our Shah; and we
were informed that he was succeeded by his brother, a lord of
the sea. Years passed away, with all their various events, without
much intercourse taking place between Persia and England.
England required no longer the friendship of the Shah,
and she therefore turned us over to the Governor of India,
for which she duly received our maledictions; and every one
who knew upon what a footing of intimacy the two nations had
stood, said, as he spat upon the ground, "Pooh! may their
house be ruined!" She left our country to be conquered, our
finest provinces to be taken from us, and never once put her
hand out to help us.</p>

<p class="indent">However, <i>Allah buzurg est!</i>&mdash;God is great! we
soon found that the good fortune of the king of kings had not forsaken
him. Rumours began to be spread abroad that affairs in England
were in a bad way. Many foreigners had enlisted themselves
in the Shah's troops, and from them we learned that, no
doubt, ere long that country must be entirely ruined, for great
dangers threatened their present king. He was said to have got
into the possession of a certain rebellious tribe, whose ultimate
aim was to set up a new sovereign, called 'People Shah,' and
to depose him and his dynasty. We heard that great poverty
reigned in that land, which I had known so rich and prosperous;
and that every department in the state had been so reduced,
that the king had not a house to live in, but that the
nation was quarrelling about the expense of building him one.</p>

<p class="indent">We still had an English <i>elchi</i> at our court, but
he enjoyed little or no consideration; and the news of the poverty of
his country was confirmed to us by what we learnt from his
secretaries. Orders, it seems, had just arrived from his court
that every economy should be observed in his expenses; and
one may suppose to what extent, when we are assured that,
by way of saving official ink, it had been strictly prohibited to
put dots to the <i>I</i>'s, or strokes to the <i>T</i>'s. Presents of
all sorts were done away with:&mdash;the ambassador would not even receive
the common present of a water-melon, lest he should be obliged
to send one in return; and his whole conduct seemed more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
directed by the calculations of debtor and creditor, like a merchant,
than by the intercourse of courtesy which ought to take
place between crowned heads. Some wicked infidels of French
would whisper abroad, that kings in Europe, like Saadi at Tabriz,
were now become less than dogs, and that therefore their
representatives had no dignities to represent; the English <i>elchi</i>,
however, would not allow this, but gave us other reasons for the
economy practised in his country, stating that, although every
one allowed that such policy was full of mischief, yet that it was
necessary to humour the whim of this People Shah, who aspired
to the crown, and whose despotism was greater than even that of
our famous Nadir Shah.</p>

<p class="indent">When I appeared at the King's Gate, and took my seat among
the minor officers who awaited the presence of the vizier previously
to his going before the Shah, the enemies of England,
of whom there were many, would taunt me with the news
spread to her disadvantage, for I was looked upon as a Frangi myself.</p>

<p class="indent">"After all," said one, "own, O Hajji! that these Ingliz
are an unclean generation; that it is quite time they should eat their
handful of abomination."&mdash;"We are tired of always hearing
them lauded," said another. "Praised be the Prophet! that
little by little we may also defile their fathers' graves, and point
our fingers at their mothers."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why address me, O little man?" said I. "Am I their
father, mother, brother, or uncle, that you address me?&mdash;It was
my destiny to go amongst them; it was my destiny to come
back. A fox does not become a swine because he goes through
the ordure of the sty in search of his own affairs. Let their
houses be bankrupt, let their fathers grill in Jehanum&mdash;what is
that to me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What words are these?" said a third. "Your beard
has changed its colour. What are become of your guns that would
reach from Tehran to Kom placed side by side, or to Ispahan
placed lengthwise? Where now are your ships that spout more
fire than Demawand, and your women like houris that can read
and write like men of the law? Formerly there was nothing in
the world like Francs; now you look upon them as dirt."</p>

<p class="indent">Had I persisted in upholding my Ingliz friends, now
that the tide had turned against them, I should have done them no good,
and myself harm; therefore I applied the cotton of deafness to
the ear of unwillingness. Most true, however, it was that they
daily lost in public estimation; and rumours of the approaching
downfal of English power and prosperity came to us from so
many quarters, that we could not do otherwise than believe them.
Whenever an Englishman now appeared in the streets, he was
called pig with impunity; and, instead of the bastinado which
the man who so insulted him formerly was wont to get, he now
was left to repeat the insult at his leisure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The fact principally urged was, that a disorder had
broken out amongst them, which affected the brain more than any other
organ; that it had taken possession of high and low, rich and
poor, master and servant; and raged with such violence, that it
was almost dangerous to go amongst them, although strangers
were said not to catch it. It was neither cholera, plague, nor
heart-ache, and could not be assimilated to any known disorder
in the East. We have no name for it in Persia; in England it
is called <i>Reform</i>: and, as it had suddenly attacked the country
when in a state of great health and prosperity, it was supposed
that some one great evil eye had struck it, and that therefore no
one could foresee what might be its mischievous results.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="indent">Whilst seated one morning in my room, inspecting
my face in my looking-glass and combing my beard, preparatory to
going to the daily selam before the king, and thanking Allah
from the bottom of my heart for being secure in my mediocrity
from all the storms and dangers of public life, a loud knocking
at my gate announced a visiter of no small importance.
My servant, for I kept one, quickly opened it, and I soon was
greeted by the <i>selam al aikum</i> of one of the royal ferashes,
who exclaimed "The Shah wants you."</p>

<p class="indent">So unusual a summons first startled, then alarmed
me. A thousand apprehensions rushed through my mind as quick as
lightning, for on such occasions in Persia one always apprehends&mdash;one
never hopes. However, I immediately gave the
usual "<i>Becheshm!</i>&mdash;Upon my eyes be it!" and prepared to
obey his command. "Can I have said '<i>Belli</i>' in the wrong
place," thought I, "at the last selam? or did I perchance exclaim
'<i>Inshallah</i>&mdash;Please God,' instead of saying '<i>Mashallah</i>&mdash;Praise
be to God'? Allah only knows," thought I, shrugging
up my shoulders, "for I am sure I do not. Whatever has happened, Khoda is merciful!"</p>

<p class="indent">I followed the ferash, but could gain no intelligence from
him which could in the least clear up my doubts. One thing I discovered,
which was that no <i>felek</i>, or sticks, had been displayed in
the Shah's presence as preparatory to a bastinado; and so far I felt safe.</p>

<p class="indent">The Shah was seated in the <i>gulistan</i>, or rose-garden;
the grand vizier stood before him, as well as Mirza Firooz, my old
master. When I appeared, all my apprehensions vanished, for
with a goodnatured voice the king ordered me to approach. I made my most
profound bow, and stood on the brink of the marble basin without my shoes.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The king said, "<i>Mashallah!</i> the Hajji
is still a <i>khoobjuan</i>&mdash;a fine youth; he is a good servant."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="indent space-above1">Upon hearing these ominous words,
I immediately felt that some very objectionable service was about
to be required of me. I answered,</p>

<p>"May the shadow of the centre of the universe never be less!
Whatever your slave can do, he will by his head and by his eyes."</p>

<p class="indent">After consulting with the grand vizier, who was standing
in the apartment in which the king was seated, his majesty exclaimed,</p>

<p class="indent">"Hajji, we require zeal, activity, and intelligence
at your hands. Matters of high import to the state of Persia demand
that one, the master of wit, the lord of experience, and the ready
in eloquence, should immediately depart from our presence, in
order to seek that of our brother the King of England. You
are the man we have selected; you must be on horseback as soon
as a fortunate hour occurs, and make your way <i>chappari</i>&mdash;as a
courier, to the gate of power in London."</p>

<p class="indent">With my thanks for so high an honour sticking in my
throat, I knelt down, and kissed the ground; but if any one present
had been skilful in detecting the manning of looks, surely he
would have read dismay and disappointment in mine.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is plain," said the Shah, turning towards the
vizier and Mirza Firooz occasionally as he spoke, "from all that has
been reported to us, that England, as it is now, is not that England
of whose riches, power, and prosperity so much has been said.
It has had its day. It is falling fast into decay. Its men are
rebellious. Its ancient dynasty ere this may have been supplanted
by another, and its king a houseless wanderer."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Belli! belli!</i>" said the vizier and Mirza Firooz.</p>

<p class="indent">"In the first place," continued the Shah, "you must
acquaint the king, my brother, if such he still be, that the gate of the
palace of the king of kings is open to all the world; it is an
asylum to kings as well as to beggars; the needy find a roof,
and the hungry food. Should the vicissitudes of life, as we hear
they are likely to do, throw him on the world, tell him he will
find a corner to sit in near our threshold; no one shall molest
him. He shall enjoy his own customs, saving, always, eating
the unclean beast; wine shall he have, and he will be allowed
to import his own wives. He may sit on chairs, shave whatever
parts of his body he likes, wear a shawl coat, diamond-beaded
daggers, and gold-headed furniture to his horse. Upon all
these different heads make his mind perfectly easy."</p>

<p class="indent">"Upon my eyes be it!" I exclaimed, with the profoundest respect.</p>

<p class="indent">"In the next place," said the king, "we have long heard
that England possesses a famous general, a long-tried and faithful
servant to his king. If he be a good servant, he will stick by
his master in his distress. You must see him, Hajji, and tell
him from the lips of the king of kings that he will be welcome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
in Persia; that he will find protection at our stirrup, and,
<i>Inshallah!</i> he will be able to make his face white before us.
Whatever else is necessary to our service will be explained to
you by our grand vizier," said the Shah; and then, after making
me a few more complimentary speeches, I was dismissed.</p>

<p class="indent">When I left the presence, I could not help thinking
that the Shah must be mad to send me upon so long a journey upon so
strange an expedition; and I inferred that there must be something
more in it than met the eye. I was not mistaken. No
sooner had the grand vizier been dismissed than he called me
into his <i>khelvet</i>, or secret chamber, and there unfolded to me
the true object of my mission.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is plain," said he, with the most unmoved gravity,
"that the graves of these infidels have been defiled, and that ere long
there will be an end of them and their prosperity. We must
take advantage of their distress. Much may be done by wisdom.
In the first place, Hajji, we shall get penknives and
broad-cloth for nothing, that is quite clear; then, spying-glasses
and chandeliers, for which they are also famous, may be
had for the asking; and&mdash;who knows?&mdash;we may obtain the workmen
who manufactured them, and thus rise on the ruins of the
infidels. All this will mainly depend upon your sagacity. Then
the Shah, who has long desired to possess some English slaves
in his harem, has thought that this will be an excellent moment
to procure some, and you will be commissioned to buy as many
as you can procure at reasonable prices. Upon the breaking up
of communities at the death of kings and governors, we have always
found, both in Iran and Turkey, that slaves and virgins
were to be bought for almost nothing; and, no doubt, that
must be the case among Francs."</p>

<p class="indent">I was bewildered at all I heard; and thus at once to be
transformed from a mere sitter in a corner to an active agent in a
foreign country, made my liver drop, and turned my face upside down.</p>

<p class="indent">"But, in the name of Allah," said I, "is it quite certain
that this ruin is going on in England? I have not read that wise
people rightly, if so suddenly they can allow themselves to be
involved in misery."</p>

<p class="indent">"What words are these?" said the vizier. "Everybody
speaks of it as the only thing certain in the world. Their own
<i>elchi</i> here allows it, and informs everybody that a great change
is going to take place in his government. And is it not plain,
that, if under their last government they have reached the
height of prosperity, a change must lead them to adversity?"</p>

<p class="indent">"We shall see," said I; "at all events, I am the
Shah's servant; whatever he orders I am bound to obey."</p>

<p class="indent">"It is evident the good fortune of that country,"
exclaimed Mirza Firooz, who was present also, "has turned ever since
it abandoned Persia to follow its own selfish views. Did I not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
say so a thousand times to the ministers of the king of England;
but they would not heed me?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Whatever has produced their misfortunes, Allah only
knows," said the grand vizier; "it is as much their duty to submit,
as it is ours to take advantage of them. We must do everything
to secure ourselves against the power of our enemies.
You must say to the King of England that the asylum of the
universe is ready to do everything to assist him; and, as he
is a man of the sea, you will just throw out the possibility of
his obtaining a command of the Shah's <i>grab</i> (ship of war) in the
Caspian Sea. As for the famous general of whom the Shah spoke,
(may the holy Prophet take him in his holy keeping!) when once
we have obtained possession of him, <i>Inshallah!</i> not one Russian
will we leave on this side the Caucasus; and it will be well for
them if we do not carry our arms to the very walls of Petersburg."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">To all these instructions all I had to say
was, "Yes, upon my eyes be it!" and when I had fully understood the object
of my mission, I took my departure, in order to make preparations
for my journey.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE PORTRAIT GALLERY.</h2>

<p class="indent">Physiognomy is the most important of all studies. Well versed
in this science, no man will be cursed with a scolding wife, a pilfering
servant, or an imbecile teacher for the offspring of his connubial
felicity. It has ever been my favourite pursuit; and, when a child, I
would not have tossed up with a pieman if he had exhibited a crusty
countenance. Lavater's immortal works are my <i>vade mecum</i>, and I
have carefully collected engraved portraits to discover the character
of every individual the limner had painted ere I read their lives. I
lately found that the Marquis of &mdash;&mdash; had pursued a similar plan.
His splendid gallery of pictures is well known in all Europe; but his
collection of portraits at his favourite seat in &mdash;&mdash; has been seen
but by a few privileged persons, and I, fortunately, was one of the number,
having been taken to his delightful mansion by his librarian, an
old college <i>chum</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Over the entrance of this gallery is an allegorical painting
by Watteau, or Lancret, which my guide explained. On the summit of a
rock, apparently of granite, and older than the Deluge, rose the
Temple of Fame. The paths that led to it, were steep and intricate,
difficulties that were not foreseen by the travellers tempted to thread
this labyrinth by the roseate bowers that formed their entrance,
inviting the weary pilgrim to seek a soft repose in their refreshing
shade. But when he awoke from his peaceful slumber and delicious
visions, renovated and invigorated, to pursue his journey, the scene
soon changed; brambles, bushes, and tangling weeds impeded his
path; and, despite the apparent solidity of the ground he trod,
quicksands and moving bogs would often dishearten the most adventurous.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Numerous were the travellers who strove to ascend the
height, but few attained its wished-for summit; while many of them,
overcome with fatigue, and despairing of success, stopped at some
of the houses of reception, bad, good, and indifferent, that they
found on the road-side.</p>

<p class="indent">However, the back part of the acclivity presented a different
prospect. There, the rock formed a terrific precipice, that no one could
ascend by the ordinary means of locomotion. A balloon at that period
had not been invented; yet I beheld a good number of visitors
merrily hopping over the flowery mead that led to the temple, culling
posies and running after butterflies, and in hearty fits of laughter
on beholding the poor pilgarlicks who were puffing and blowing
in vain to climb up the other face of the hill. The success of these
fortunate adventurers amazed me, until my <i>cicerone</i> pointed out to
me, a personage fantastically dressed in the height of fashion, bewhiskered
and moustached, hoisting up his favourite companions with
a rope, securely fastened to the brink of the cliff. This individual, I
found, was a brother of the goddess, and his name was <i>Effrontus</i>.
His sister had long endeavoured to rid herself of his importunities,
and had frequently complained to Jupiter to send the knave out of
the country; but the fellow had so ingratiated himself at court,&mdash;more
especially with the ladies, one of whom, by name <i>Famosa</i>,
supported him in all his extravagancies,&mdash;that he snapped his fingers
at his sister, and, by means of a latch-key, (forged by Vulcan as a
reward to Mercury for his vigilance over his wife, when he was obliged
to be absent in his workshop,) he could admit his impertinent
cronies into the very <i>sanctum</i> of her abode, where they not only
revelled in every luxury, but actually sent out their scouts and tigers
to increase the obstacles that rendered the roads up the hill more
impracticable, and terrify by alarming reports the timid voyagers who
were struggling up the rugged steep. The contrast between these
adventurers was curious. The creatures of <i>Effrontus</i>, whom he had
hoisted up, were all clad in cloth of gold, or in black suits of silk
and broadcloth, and some of them wore large wigs of various forms
and dimensions; while the poor pilgrims were all in tatters, and, to
all appearance, not rich enough to purchase wigs, although they most
needed them, as they were nearly all bald or greyheaded. Howbeit,
these fortunate candidates for celebrity were not always prosperous;
for the height they had ascended, swinging to and fro by the rope
of <i>Effrontus</i>, like boys bird-nesting in the Isle of Wight, suspended
from the cliff, frequently made them giddy, and occasioned vertigoes
and dimness of sight, in consequence of which they would sometimes
fall over the precipice when they fancied they were roaming about in
security, and were dashed to pieces in the very dirty valley where
not long before they had grovelled.</p>

<p class="indent">This allegory appeared to me ingenious; but when my guide
opened the door, and I found myself in a room hung round with portraits
of celebrated physicians, I observed that the painting was most
applicable to the gallery. My companion smiled at my remark, and proceeded
to describe some of the doctors whose likenesses I beheld. He
said "This gentleman, so finically dressed, with powdered curls, Brussels
lace frills and ruffles, was the celebrated <span class="smcap">Dr. Dulcet</span>.
You may perceive that a smile of self-complacency plays on his simpering countenance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
yet his brow portrays some anxious cares, arising from inordinate
vanity; and those furrows on the forehead show that, fortunate
as he may have been, ambition would sometimes ruffle his pillow.</p>

<p class="indent">Dulcet was of a low origin, and his education had been
much neglected; however, he possessed a good figure, handsome features, and
a tolerable share of impudence. When an apothecary's apprentice,
his advantageous points had been perceived by a discriminating
duchess, who sent him to Aberdeen to graduate; and shortly after
his return, he was introduced to royalty and fashion. Aware of the
fickleness of Fortune, and well acquainted with the miseries that
attend her frowns, he displayed a tact in courting the beldame's
favour that would have done honour to the most experienced and
<i>canny</i> emigrant from the Land of <i>Cakes</i> roving over the world
in search of <i>bread</i>. He commenced his career, by courting the old and
the ugly of the fair sex, and devoting his <i>petits soins</i> soon to
all the little urchins whom he was called to attend. Handsome women he well
knew were satiated with adulation, whereas flattery was a god-send
to those ladies who were not so advantageously gifted: these he
complimented on their intellectual superiority, their enlightened
mind, "that in itself contains the living fountains of beauteous and
sublime." Though the object of his attentions never opened a book,
save and excepting the Lady's Magazine, or read any thing but accounts
of fashionable <i>fracas</i>, offences, and births, deaths, and marriages
in the newspapers, he would discourse upon literature and arts,
bring them publications as intelligible to them as a Hebrew Talmud,
ask their opinion of every new novel or celebrated painting,&mdash;any
popular opera or favourite performer. If the lady had children, the
ugliest little toad was called an angel; and such of the imps who had
been favoured by nature in cross-breeding, he would swear were the
image of their mother. To court the creatures, he constantly gave
them sugar-plums (which afforded the double advantage or ministering
to their gluttony and to his friend the apothecary); while he presented
them with <i>pretty</i> little books of <i>pictures</i>, and <i>nice</i> toys.
He had, moreover, a happy knack of squeezing out a sympathetic tear from the
corner of his eye whenever the brat roared from pain or perversity; and on
those occasions he would screw his eyes until the crystal drop was
made to fall upon the mother's alabaster hand. It is needless to add,
that the whole <i>coterie</i> rang with the extreme sensibility, the excellent
heart of the dear doctor, who had saved the darling's life, although
nothing had ailed the sweet pet but an over-stuffing.</p>

<p class="indent">Another quality recommended him to female protection. Husbands
and father she ever considered as intruders in a consultation: he merely
looked upon them as the bankers of the ladies. It is true that, after
a domestic breeze, his visits were sometimes dispensed with for a short
time; but dreadful hysterics, that kept the whole house in an uproar
both night and day, soon brought back the doctor, who was the only
person who knew <i>my lady's</i> constitution, and on these occasions the
lady's lord was too happy to take his hat and seek a refuge at Crockford's,
or some other consolatory refuge from nerves. It was certainly
true that Dulcet had made many important discoveries in the treatment
of ladies' affections. For instance, he had ascertained that a pair of
bays were more effectual in curing spasms, than chestnuts or greys,
unless his patient preferred them. Then, again, he was convinced that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
Rundell and Bridge kept better remedies than Savory and Moore:
a box at the Opera was an infallible cure for a headache; and the air
of Brighton was absolutely necessary when its salutary effects were
increased by the breath of Royalty. Cards he looked upon as indispensable,
to prevent ladies from taking laudanum; and a successful
game of <i>écarté</i> was as effectual an opiate, as extract of
lettuce,&mdash;one of his most favourite drugs.</p>

<p class="indent">In this career of prosperity, a circumstance arose that
for a time damped his ardour. Dulcet had attended an East-Indian widow, the
wealthy relict of a civil servant of the Company. Her hand and fortune
would have enabled the doctor to throw physic to the dogs, and
all the nasty little brats whom he idolised after it. He had succeeded
in becoming a great favourite. The disconsolate lady could not
eat, drink, or sleep, without giving him his guinea. She scarcely
knew at what end she was to break an egg, or how many grains of
salt she could safely put in it, without his opinion; but, unfortunately,
there was a certain colonel, an old friend of her former husband, who
was a constant visitor, and who seemed to share with her medical
attendant the lady's confidence. Though Dulcet ordered her not to
receive visitors when in a nervous state, somehow or other the colonel
had been admitted. On such occasions he would shake his head
in the most sapient manner, and observe that the pulse was much
agitated; but he did not dare forbid these (to him) dangerous visits,
and therefore endeavoured to attain his ends by a more circuitous
route, and gain time until the colonel's departure for Bengal afforded
him the vantage-ground of absence. The widow would sometimes
complain of her moping and lonely life. On these occasions Dulcet
would delicately hint that at some <i>future period</i> a change of condition
might be desirable, and the widow would then sigh deeply, and perchance
shed a few tears, (whether from the recollection of her dear
departed husband, or the idea of the '<i>future period</i>' of this change
of condition,&mdash;a <i>futurity</i> which was <i>sine die</i>,&mdash;I cannot pretend
to say); but the doctor strove to impress upon her mind, that in her <i>present</i>
delicate state, the cares of a family, the pangs of absence, the turmoil
of society, would shake her 'too tender frame' to very atoms, while
the slightest shadow of an unkind shade would break her sensitive
heart; whereas a <i>leetle</i> tranquillity would soon restore her to that society
of which she was considered the brightest ornament! And then
the sigh would become still deeper, and the tears would trickle down
her pallid cheek with increased rapidity, until Dulcet actually fancied
that 'the Heaven-moving pearls' were not beaded in sorrow, but
were 'shed from Nature like a kindly shower.' Still he knew the
sex too well, to venture upon so delicate a subject as matrimonial consolation;
and he, with no little reluctance, parted with a few fees to
obtain some intelligence regarding the lady's toilet-thoughts and conversation
with her favourite woman, a certain cunning abigail named
Mercer. Mercer was of course subject to nervous affections, which
she caught from her mistress; and Dulcet was as kind to the maid
as to her lady, well knowing that as no hero is a great man in the
eyes of his valet, no widow was crystalised with her waiting-maid.
The visits of the colonel had not been as frequent as usual; nay,
Dulcet fancied that he was received with some coolness, and on this
important matter Mercer was prudently consulted. The result of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
conference fully confirmed the doctor's fondest hopes; for he learnt
from Mercer that 'her missus liked him above all and was never
by no means half as fond of the colonel, as she knew for certain
that those soldier-officers were not better than they ought to be, and
there were red-rags on every bush.' This communication, although
made with cockney vulgarity, had a more powerful effect upon the
doctor than had he heard Demosthenes or Cicero; and he could have
embraced the girl with delight and gratitude had he dared it,&mdash;but
she was handsomer than her mistress; he, moreover, fancied that such
a condescension might tempt the girl's vanity to boast of the favour;
but he gave her something more substantial than a kiss,&mdash;a diamond
ring that graced his little finger, and which he always displayed to
advantage when feeling a tender pulse.</p>

<p class="indent">Dulcet now altered his plan of campaign, redoubled his
assiduity, assured the widow that she was fast recovering her pristine
strength and healthy glow, and recommended her to shorten the 'futurity
of the period' he had alluded to; assuring her that <i>now</i> the cares
of a family would give her occupation, and society once more would
hail her presence with delight. In her sweet smiles of satisfaction
he read his future bliss and independence. The colonel never came
to the house; and, one day, our doctor was on the point of declaring
the purity and the warmth of his affection, when the widow rendered
the avowal needless, informing him that she had resolved to follow his
<i>kind advice</i>, and that the ensuing week she was to be married to
<span class="smcap">The Colonel</span>, who had gone down into the country to
regulate his affairs. The blow fell upon Dulcet like an apoplexy. Prudence made
him conceal the bitterness of his disappointment, and even induced
him to be present at the wedding breakfast; though his appetite
was doubly impaired when he found that Miss Mercer had married
the colonel's valet, and he beheld his diamond guarding her wedding-ring,
while an ironical smile showed him, what little faith was
to be reposed in ladies' women.</p>

<p class="indent">The report of this adventure entertained the town for nine
days; but on the tenth, through the patronage of his protectresses, Dulcet
was dubbed a knight, and soon after married a cheesemonger's
daughter, ugly enough to have a hereditary claim to virtue; but who
possessed an ample fortune, and was most anxious to become a lady.</p>

<p class="indent">The librarian was proceeding to give me an account of
the next personage, a Dr. Cleaver, when the bell rung for dinner, and we
adjourned our illustrations until the following morning.</p>

<h2>STRAY CHAPTERS.</h2>
<p class="f110">BY BOZ.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p class="f110 space-below1"><b>THE PANTOMIME OF LIFE.</b></p>

<p class="indent">Before we plunge headlong into this paper, let us at
once confess to a fondness for pantomimes&mdash;to a gentle sympathy
with clowns and pantaloons&mdash;to an unqualified admiration of
harlequins and columbines&mdash;to a chaste delight in every action
of their brief existence, varied and many-coloured as those
actions are, and inconsistent though they occasionally be with
those rigid and formal rules of propriety which regulate the
proceedings of meaner and less comprehensive minds. We
revel in pantomimes&mdash;not because they dazzle one's eyes with
tinsel and gold leaf; not because they present to us, once again,
the well-beloved chalked faces, and goggle eyes of our childhood;
not even because, like Christmas-day, and Twelfth-night,
and Shrove Tuesday, and one's own birth-day, they come to us
but once a-year;&mdash;our attachment is founded on a graver and a
very different reason. A pantomime is to us, a mirror of life;
nay more, we maintain that it is so to audiences generally, although
they are not aware of it; and that this very circumstance
is the secret cause of their amusement and delight.</p>

<p class="indent">Let us take a slight example. The scene is a street:
an elderly gentleman, with a large face, and strongly marked features,
appears. His countenance beams with a sunny smile,
and a perpetual dimple is on his broad red cheek. He is evidently
an opulent elderly gentlemen, comfortable in circumstances,
and well to do in the world. He is not unmindful of
the adornment of his person, for he is richly, not to say gaudily
dressed; and that he indulges to a reasonable extent in the
pleasures of the table, may be inferred from the joyous and oily
manner in which he rubs his stomach, by way of informing the
audience that he is going home to dinner. In the fullness of his
heart, in the fancied security of wealth, in the possession and
enjoyment of all the good things of life, the elderly gentleman
suddenly loses his footing, and stumbles. How the audience
roar! He is set upon by a noisy and officious crowd,
who buffet and cuff him unmercifully. They scream with delight!
Every time the elderly gentleman struggles to get up,
his relentless persecutors knock him down again. The spectators
are convulsed with merriment! And when at last the
elderly gentleman does get up, and staggers away, despoiled of
hat, wig, and clothing, battered to pieces, and his watch
and money gone, they are exhausted with laughter, and express
their merriment and admiration in rounds of applause.</p>

<p class="indent">Is this like life? Change the scene to any real street;&mdash;to
the Stock Exchange, or the City banker's; the merchant's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
counting-house, or even the tradesman's shop. See any one of
these men fall,&mdash;the more suddenly, and the nearer the zenith
of his pride and riches, the better. What a wild hallo is raised
over his prostrate carcase by the shouting mob; how they
whoop and yell as he lies humbled beneath them! Mark how
eagerly they set upon him when he is down; and how they
mock and deride him as he slinks away. Why, it is the pantomime
to the very letter.</p>

<p class="indent">Of all the pantomimic <i>dramatis personæ</i>, we
consider the pantaloon the most worthless and debauched. Independent of
the dislike, one naturally feels at seeing a gentleman of his years
engaged in pursuits highly unbecoming his gravity and time
of life, we cannot conceal from ourselves the fact that he is a
treacherous worldly-minded old villain, constantly enticing his
younger companion, the clown, into acts of fraud or petty
larceny, and generally standing aside to watch the result of the
enterprise: if it be successful, he never forgets to return for his
share of the spoil; but if it turn out a failure, he generally
retires with remarkable caution and expedition, and keeps
carefully aloof until the affair has blown over. His amorous
propensities, too, are eminently disagreeable; and his mode of
addressing ladies in the open street at noon-day is downright
improper, being usually neither more nor less than a perceptible
tickling of the aforesaid ladies in the waist, after committing
which, he starts back, manifestly ashamed (as well he may be)
of his own indecorum and temerity; continuing, nevertheless, to
ogle and beckon to them from a distance in a very unpleasant
and immoral manner.</p>

<p class="indent">Is there any man who cannot count a dozen pantaloons
in his own social circle? Is there any man who has not seen them
swarming at the west end of the town on a sun-shiny day or a
summer's evening, going through the last-named pantomimic
feats with as much liquorish energy, and as total an absence of
reserve, as if they were on the very stage itself? We can tell
upon our fingers a dozen pantaloons of our acquaintance at this
moment&mdash;capital pantaloons, who have been performing all
kinds of strange freaks, to the great amusement of their friends
and acquaintance, for years past; and who to this day are
making such comical and ineffectual attempts to be young and
dissolute, that all beholders are like to die with laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">Take that old gentleman who has just emerged from the
<i>Café de l'Europe</i> in the Haymarket, where he has been dining
at the expense of the young man upon town with whom he
shakes hands as they part at the door of the tavern. The
affected warmth of that shake of the hand, the courteous nod,
the obvious recollection of the dinner, the savoury flavour of
which still hangs upon his lips, are all characteristics of his
great prototype. He hobbles away humming an opera tune,
and twirling his cane to and fro, with affected carelessness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
Suddenly he stops&mdash;'tis at the milliner's window. He peeps
through one of the large panes of glass; and, his view of the
ladies within being obstructed by the India shawls, directs his
attentions to the young girl with the bandbox in her hand, who
is gazing in at the window also. See! he draws beside her.
He coughs; she turns away from him. He draws near her
again; she disregards him. He gleefully chucks her under
the chin, and, retreating a few steps, nods and beckons with
fantastic grimaces, while the girl bestows a contemptuous and
supercilious look upon his wrinkled visage. She turns away
with a flounce, and the old gentleman trots after her with a
toothless chuckle. The pantaloon to the life!</p>

<p class="indent">But the close resemblance which the clowns of the
stage bear to those of every-day life, is perfectly extraordinary.
Some people talk with a sigh of the decline of pantomime, and murmur
in low and dismal tones the name of Grimaldi. We mean
no disparagement to the worthy and excellent old man when we
say, that this is downright nonsense. Clowns that beat Grimaldi
all to nothing turn up every day, and nobody patronises
them&mdash;more's the pity!</p>

<p class="indent">"I know who you mean," says some dirty-faced patron
of Mr. Osbaldistone's, laying down the Miscellany when he has
got thus far; and bestowing upon vacancy a most knowing
glance: "you mean C. J. Smith as did Guy Fawkes, and
George Barnwell, at the Garden." The dirty-faced gentleman
has hardly uttered the words when he is interrupted by a young
gentleman in no shirt-collar and a Petersham coat. "No, no,"
says the young gentleman; "he means Brown, King, and
Gibson, at the 'Delphi." Now, with great deference both to
the first-named gentleman with the dirty face, and the last-named
gentleman in the non-existing shirt-collar, we do not
mean, either the performer who so grotesquely burlesqued the
Popish conspirator, or the three unchangeables who have been
dancing the same dance under different imposing titles, and
doing the same thing under various high-sounding names, for
some five or six years last past. We have no sooner made this
avowal than the public, who have hitherto been silent witnesses
of the dispute, inquire what on earth it is we <i>do</i> mean;
and, with becoming respect, we proceed to tell them.</p>

<p class="indent">It is very well known to all play-goers and pantomime-seers,
that the scenes in which a theatrical clown is at the very height
of his glory are those which are described in the play-bills as
"Cheesemonger's shop, and Crockery warehouse," or "Tailor's
shop, and Mrs. Queertable's boarding-house," or places bearing
some such title, where the great fun of the thing consists in the
hero's taking lodgings which he has not the slightest intention
of paying for, or obtaining goods under false pretences, or abstracting
the stock-in-trade of the respectable shopkeeper next
door, or robbing warehouse-porters as they pass under his window,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
or, to shorten the catalogue, in his swindling everybody he
possibly can; it only remaining to be observed, that the more
extensive the swindling is, and the more barefaced the impudence
of the swindler, the greater the rapture and ecstasy of
the audience. Now it is a most remarkable fact that precisely
this sort of thing occurs in real life day after day, and nobody
sees the humour of it. Let us illustrate our position by detailing
the plot of this portion of the pantomime&mdash;not of the
theatre, but of life.</p>

<p class="indent">The Honourable Captain Fitz-Whisker Fiercy, attended by
his livery-servant Do'em,&mdash;a most respectable servant to look at,
who has grown grey in the service of the captain's family,&mdash;views,
treats for, and ultimately obtains possession of, the unfurnished
house, such a number, such a street. All the tradesmen
in the neighbourhood are in agonies of competition for the
captain's custom; the captain is a good-natured, kind-hearted,
easy man, and, to avoid being the cause of disappointment to
any, he most handsomely gives orders to all. Hampers of
wine, baskets of provisions, cart-loads of furniture, boxes of
jewellery, supplies of luxuries of the costliest description, flock
to the house of the Honourable Captain Fitz-Whisker Fiercy,
where they are received with the utmost readiness by the highly
respectable Do'em; while the captain himself struts and swaggers
about with that compound air of conscious superiority, and
general blood-thirstiness, which a military captain should always,
and does most times wear, to the admiration and terror
of plebeian men. But the tradesmen's backs are no sooner
turned, than the captain, with all the eccentricity of a mighty
mind, and assisted by the faithful Do'em, whose devoted fidelity
is not the least touching part of his character, disposes of everything
to great advantage; for, although the articles fetch small
sums, still they are sold considerably above cost price, the cost
to the captain having been nothing at all. After various
man&oelig;uvres, the imposture is discovered, Fitz-Fiercy and Do'em
are recognised as confederates, and the police-office to which
they are both taken is thronged with their dupes.</p>

<p class="indent">Who can fail to recognise in this, the exact counterpart
of the best portion of a theatrical pantomime&mdash;Fitz-Whisker
Fiercy by the clown; Do'em by the pantaloon; and supernumeraries
by the tradesmen? The best of the joke, too, is that
the very coal-merchant who is loudest in his complaints against
the person who defrauded him, is the identical man who sat in
the centre of the very front row of the pit last night and
laughed the most boisterously at this very same thing,&mdash;and
not so well done either. Talk of Grimaldi, we say again!
Did Grimaldi, in his best days, ever do anything in this way
equal to Da Costa?</p>

<p class="indent">The mention of this latter justly-celebrated clown reminds
us of his last piece of humour, the fraudulently obtaining certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
stamped acceptances from a young gentleman in the army.
We had scarcely laid down our pen to contemplate for a few
moments this admirable actor's performance of that exquisite
practical joke, than a new branch of our subject flashed suddenly
upon us. So we take it up again at once.</p>

<p class="indent">All people who have been behind the scenes, and most
people who have been before them, know, that in the representation of
a pantomime, a good many men are sent upon the stage for the
express purpose of being cheated, or knocked down, or both.
Now, down to a moment ago, we had never been able to understand
for what possible purpose a great number of odd, lazy,
large-headed men, whom one is in the habit of meeting here, and
there, and everywhere, could ever have been created. We see
it all, now. They are the supernumeraries in the pantomime
of life; the men who have been thrust into it, with no other
view than to be constantly tumbling over each other, and
running their heads against all sorts of strange things. We
sat opposite to one of these men at a supper-table, only last
week. Now we think of it, he was exactly like the gentlemen
with the pasteboard heads and faces, who do the corresponding
business in the theatrical pantomimes; there was the same
broad stolid simper&mdash;the same dull leaden eye&mdash;the same
unmeaning, vacant stare; and whatever was said, or whatever was
done, he always came in at precisely the wrong place, or jostled
against something that he had not the slightest business with.
We looked at the man across the table, again and again; and
could not satisfy ourselves what race of beings to class him with.
How very odd that this never occurred to us before!</p>

<p class="indent">We will frankly own that we have been much troubled
with the harlequin. We see harlequins of so many kinds in the real
living pantomime, that we hardly know which to select as the
proper fellow of him of the theatres. At one time we were disposed
to think that the harlequin was neither more nor less
than a young man of family and independent property, who
had run away with an opera-dancer, and was fooling his life
and his means away in light and trivial amusements. On reflection,
however, we remembered that harlequins are occasionally
guilty of witty, and even clever acts, and we are rather
disposed to acquit our young men of family and independent
property, generally speaking, of any such misdemeanours. On
a more mature consideration of the subject, we have arrived at
the conclusion, that the harlequins of life are just ordinary men,
to be found in no particular walk or degree, on whom a certain
station, or particular conjunction of circumstances, confers the
magic wand; and this brings us to a few words on the pantomime
of public and political life, which we shall say at once,
and then conclude; merely premising in this place, that we decline
any reference whatever to the columbine: being in no wise
satisfied of the nature of her connexion with her parti-coloured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
lover, and not feeling by any means clear that we should be
justified in introducing her to the virtuous and respectable
ladies who peruse our lucubrations.</p>

<p class="indent">We take it that the commencement of a session of
parliament is neither more nor less than the drawing up of the curtain
for a grand comic pantomime; and that his Majesty's most gracious
speech, on the opening thereof, may be not inaptly compared to
the clown's opening speech of "Here we are!" "My lords
and gentlemen, here we are!" appears, to our mind at least, to
be a very good abstract of the point and meaning of the propitiatory
address of the ministry. When we remember how
frequently this speech is made, immediately after the <i>change</i>
too, the parallel is quite perfect, and still more singular.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps the cast of our political pantomime never was
richer than at this day. We are particularly strong in clowns. At
no former time, we should say, have we had such astonishing
tumblers, or performers so ready to go through the whole of
their feats for the amusement of an admiring throng. Their
extreme readiness to exhibit, indeed, has given rise to some ill-natured
reflections; it having been objected that by exhibiting
gratuitously through the country when the theatre is closed,
they reduce themselves to the level of mountebanks, and thereby
tend to degrade the respectability of the profession. Certainly
Grimaldi never did this sort of thing; and though Brown,
King, and Gibson have gone to the Surrey in vacation time,
and Mr. C. J. Smith has ruralised at Sadler's Wells, we find
no theatrical precedent for a general tumbling through the
country, except in the gentleman, name unknown, who threw
summersets on behalf of the late Mr. Richardson, and who is
no authority either, because he had never been on the regular boards.</p>

<p class="indent">But, laying aside this question, which after all is
a mere matter of taste, we may reflect with pride and gratification of
heart on the proficiency of our clowns as exhibited in the
season. Night after night will they twist and tumble about,
till two, three, and four o'clock in the morning; playing the
strangest antics, and giving each other the funniest slaps on the
face that can possibly be imagined, without evincing the smallest
tokens of fatigue. The strange noises, the confusion, the shouting
and roaring, amid which all this is done, too, would put
to shame the most turbulent sixpenny gallery that ever yelled
through a boxing-night.</p>

<p class="indent">It is especially curious to behold one of these
clowns compelled to go through the most surprising contortions by the
irresistible influence of the wand of office, which his leader or
harlequin holds above his head. Acted upon by this wonderful
charm he will become perfectly motionless, moving neither
hand, foot, nor finger, and will even lose the faculty of speech
at an instant's notice; or, on the other hand, he will become all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
life and animation if required, pouring forth a torrent of words
without sense or meaning, throwing himself into the wildest and
most fantastic contortions, and even grovelling on the earth and
licking up the dust. These exhibitions are more curious than
pleasing; indeed they are rather disgusting than otherwise, except
to the admirers of such things, with whom we confess we
have no fellow-feeling.</p>

<p class="indent">Strange tricks&mdash;very strange tricks&mdash;are also
performed by the harlequin who holds for the time being, the magic wand
which we have just mentioned. The mere waving it before a
man's eyes will dispossess his brain of all the notions previously
stored there, and fill it with an entirely new set of ideas; one
gentle tap on the back will alter the colour of a man's coat
completely; and there are some expert performers, who, having
this wand held first on one side, and then on the other, will
change from side to side, turning their coats at every evolution,
with so much rapidity and dexterity, that the quickest eye can
scarcely detect their motions. Occasionally, the genius who confers
the wand, wrests it from the hand of the temporary possessor,
and consigns it to some new performer; on which occasions
all the characters change sides, and then the race and the hard
knocks begin anew.</p>

<p class="indent">We might have extended this chapter to a much greater
length&mdash;we might have carried the comparison into the liberal
professions&mdash;we might have shown, as was in fact our original
purpose, that each is in itself a little pantomime with scenes and
characters of its own, complete; but, as we fear we have been
quite lengthy enough already, we shall leave this chapter just
where it is. A gentleman, not altogether unknown as a dramatic
poet, wrote thus a year or two ago&mdash;</p>

scarcely-worth-mentioning little distance of a few millions of leagues
behind, venture to add, by way of new reading, that he meant a Pantomime,
and that we are all actors in The Pantomime of Life.</p>

<h2>MEMOIRS OF SAMUEL FOOTE.</h2>

<p class="indent">Few writers obtained a larger share of notoriety during
their lifetime than Samuel Foote. If the interest which he excited was not
very profound, it was at any rate very generally diffused throughout
the community. His witty sayings were in every one's mouth; his
plays were the rage of the day; he was the constant guest of royalty,
the Dukes of York and Cumberland being among his staunchest
friends and patrons; and the "Sir Oracle" of all the <i>bons vivants</i>
and would-be wits of the metropolis. Take up any light memoir of those
days, and you shall scarcely find one that does not bear testimony to
the powers of this incomparable humourist. Yet, what is he now?
A name,&mdash;perhaps a great one,&mdash;but little more. His plays are
seldom acted, though the best Major Sturgeon and Jerry Sneak that
the stage ever had are still among us; and as seldom perused in the
closet, or assuredly they would have been republished oftener than
has been the case of late years.</p>

<p class="indent">We are induced, therefore, to give a brief memoir of our
English Aristophanes, accompanied by as brief a criticism on his genius, such
a task falling naturally, indeed almost necessarily, within the scope
of our Miscellany. But enough of preface: "now to business," as
Foote's own Vamp would say.</p>

<p class="indent">Samuel Foote was born at Truro in the year 1720. His family
was of credible extraction, his father being a gentleman of some repute
in Cornwall as receiver of fines for the duchy; and his mother, the
daughter of Sir Edward Goodere, Bart. M.P. for Herefordshire.
From this lady, whom he closely resembled in appearance and manner,
he is supposed to have inherited that turn for "merry malice"
for which he was famous above all his contemporaries. Mr. Cooke, in
his notices of Foote, describes his mother as having been "the very
model of her son Samuel,&mdash;short, fat, and flabby," and nearly equally
remarkable for the broad humour of her conversation.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">At an early age, young Foote was despatched to a
school at Worcester, where he soon became notorious for his practical jokes and
inveterate propensity to caricature. He was the leader in all the
rebellions of the boys, and perpetrated much small mischief on his
own private account. Among other of his freaks, it is stated that
he was in the habit of anointing his master's lips with ink while he
slept in the chair of authority, and then bewildering and overwhelming
the good man with a host of grave apologies. Yet, with all this,
he was attentive to his studies, reading hard by fits and starts; and
left Worcester with the reputation of being that very ambiguous
character&mdash;a "lad of parts."</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">At the usual period of life, Foote was entered of Worcester
College, Oxford, where, as at school, his favourite amusement consisted in
quizzing the authorities,&mdash;more especially the provost, who was a
grave, pedantic scholar, of a vinegar turn of temperament. The
following hoax is recorded as having been played off by him in his
Freshman's year. In one of the villages near Oxford there was a
church that stood close by a shady lane, through which cattle
were in the habit of being driven to and fro from grass. From the
steeple or belfry of this church dangled a rope, probably for the
convenience of the ringers, which overhung the porch, and descended to
within a few feet of the ground. Foote, who chanced to see it in the
course of one of his rambles, resolved to make it the subject of a
practical joke; and accordingly, one night, just as the cattle were
passing down the lane, tied a wisp of fresh hay tightly about the
rope by way of bait. The scheme succeeded to a miracle. One
of the cows, as she passed the church-porch, attracted by the fragrant
smell of the fodder, stopped to nibble at, and tear it away from
the rope; and by so doing set the bell tolling, infinitely to the
astonishment and perplexity of the village authorities, who did not
detect the hoax, which was repeated more than once, till the circumstance
had become the talk of the neighbourhood for miles round. We
do not vouch for the authenticity of this anecdote, though more than
one biographer has alluded to it; but, as it is highly characteristic of
Foote, we think it not unlikely to be true.</p>

<p class="indent">On quitting the university, Foote returned for a few months
to his father's house at Truro, at which period it was that a frightful tragedy
occurred in his family, which he seldom spoke of afterwards, and
never without the deepest emotion. We allude to the murder of his
uncle Sir John Goodere, by the baronet's brother Captain Goodere,
which took place about the year 1740. The parties had been dining
together at a friend's house near Bristol; apparently a reconciliation&mdash;for
they had been for some time on bad terms with each other,
owing to certain money transactions&mdash;had been agreed to between
them; but, on his return home, Sir John was waylaid, by his brother's
orders, by the crew of his vessel, which lay at anchor in the roads;
carried on board, and there strangled; the assassin looking on the
while, and actually furnishing the rope by which the murder was
perpetrated. For this atrocious deed, the Captain and his confederates,
who, it appears, made no attempt at concealment, were tried at
the Bristol assizes, found guilty, and hanged.</p>

<p class="indent">But the strangest part of this strange story remains to be
told. On the night the murder was committed, Foote arrived at his father's
house at Truro, and describes himself as having been kept awake for some
time by the softest and sweetest strains of music he had ever heard.
At first he imagined that it was a serenade got up by some of the family,
by way of a welcome home; but, on looking out of his windows,
could see no trace of the musicians, so was compelled to come to the
conclusion that the sounds were the mere offspring of his imagination.
When, however, he learned shortly afterwards that the catastrophe to
which we have alluded, had occurred on the same night, and at the
same hour when he had been greeted by the mysterious melody, he
became, says one of his biographers, persuaded that it was a
supernatural warning, and retained this impression to the last moment
of his existence. Yet the man who was thus strongly susceptible
of superstitious influences, and who could mistake a singing in the
head, occasioned possibly by convivial indulgence, for a hint direct
from heaven, was the same who overwhelmed Johnson with ridicule
for believing in the Cock-lane ghost!</p>

<p class="indent">At the age of twenty-two, shortly after he had quitted
Oxford, Foote entered the Temple; rented an expensive set of chambers;
sported a dashing equipage; gave constant convivial parties;
gambled&mdash;betted&mdash;aped the man of fashion and of title&mdash;in a
word, distinguished himself as one of the most exquisite fops about town. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
those days the fop was quite a different sort of person from what he
is now. He was a wit, and very frequently a scholar; whereas he is
now, in the majority of instances,&mdash;to quote Swift's pungent sarcasm,&mdash;"a
mere peg whereon to hang a trim suit of clothes." The last
legitimate fop, or dandy, vanished from the scene of gay life with
Brummell. He was the <i>Ultimus Romanorum</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">One of Foote's most frequent places of resort was the Bedford
Coffee-house, then the favourite lounge of all the aspiring wits of the
day. Here Fielding, Beauclerk, Bonnell Thornton, and a host of
kindred spirits, used to lay down the law to their consenting audience;
and here too many of those verdicts issued which stamped the character
of the "last new piece." Such desultory habits of life&mdash;to say
nothing of his inveterate propensity to gambling&mdash;soon dissipated the
handsome fortune which Foote had acquired by his father's death;
and, at the end of three years, he was compelled to quit the law, and
resort to some other means of gaining a livelihood.</p>

<p class="indent">From a young and enthusiastic amateur of the stage to a performer
on its boards, is no unnatural transition; and we find Foote, somewhere
about the year 1743, associated with his friend Macklin in the
management of a wooden theatre in the Haymarket. Having a lofty notion
of his tragic capabilities, he made his <i>debut</i> in the character of
Othello; and, like Mathews, Liston, and Keeley, who began their theatrical
career in the same mistaken spirit, convulsed the audience with
the grotesque extravagance of his passion, and the irresistible drollery
of his pathos. Finding therefore that his forte did not lie in tragedy, he
next had recourse to comedy, and made a tolerable hit at Drury-lane
in the parts of Sir Paul Pliant, Bayes, and Fondlewife. We have
seen a portrait of him in this last character,&mdash;one of Congreve's earliest
and raciest,&mdash;and, if it be at all like him, we do not wonder at his
success, for his countenance is replete with the true sly, oily,
hypocritical expression.</p>

<p class="indent">In the ear 1747, Foote produced his first piece at the Haymarket,
in which he mimicked the peculiarities of several well-known actors,
and, among others, Macklin. The play was successful; but its performance
having been interdicted by the Westminster magistrates,
Foote brought it out in a new form, under the title of "Diversions of
the Morning," and issued cards of invitation to the public, requesting
the honour of their company to a tea-party (at playhouse prices) at
the Haymarket. The experiment was a decided hit, and was followed
up next season by an "Auction of Pictures," in which the author
lashed with pitiless ridicule the Virtuoso follies of the day.</p>

<p class="indent">Foote was now once again in possession of a handsome competency,
for, in addition to the money made by his labours as an author and an
actor, an unexpected legacy was left him by some branch of his mother's
family. Intoxicated by his good fortune, and unwarned by
experience, he resumed his old habits of extravagance; but, finding
that his funds did not disappear fast enough, he accelerated their
diminution by a trip to Paris, where he remained two or three years,
and did not return home until he found himself, as before, reduced
to his last shilling.</p>

<p class="indent">Immediately on his arrival in London, Foote renewed his
engagement at Drury-lane, and performed the principal character in his
own play of "The Knights;" but this proving less attractive than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
the two former ones, he abruptly quitted town, and crossed the channel
to Dublin, where, in the year 1760, he brought out at the Crowstreet
theatre his celebrated comedy, "The Minor." This, which
was then a mere crude sketch in two acts, was unequivocally damned;
but the circumstance, so far from depressing the author's spirits, only
stimulated him to fresh exertions, and after mercifully revising the
play, and adding a third act, he produced it at the Haymarket. His
industry did not go unrewarded. The success of the comedy equalled
his most sanguine expectations, being played without intermission
throughout the season, to houses crammed to the very ceiling.</p>

<p class="indent">It is a singular fact connected with this piquant play, that its
author, doubtful of its reception, sent it in MS. to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
with a request that, if he found any objectionable passages, he
would do him the favour to expunge them. Of course, his Grace
declined all interference with such a heterodox production, observing
to a friend, that if he had made the slightest alteration, the wag
might possibly have published it, as "corrected and prepared for the
press by the Archbishop of Canterbury!" This is as good a story as
that told of Shelley, who is said to have sent a copy of his "Queen
Mab" to each of the twenty-four bishops. The part which Foote
played in the "Minor" was that of the notorious Mother Cole; and
the Parson Squintem, to whom this exemplary specimen of womankind&mdash;as
Jonathan Oldbuck would say&mdash;makes such repeated allusions, is
supposed to have been the celebrated Whitfield.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Minor" was followed in 1762 by "The Liar," which
was brought out at Covent Garden. This drama, the idea of which is
borrowed from the "Menteur" of Corneille, brought full houses for
the season; and was succeeded in the same year by the "Orators,"&mdash;an
amusing play, but by no means one of its author's best,&mdash;in which
he ridiculed Falkner, the printer of the Dublin Journal, and for which
he got entangled in a tedious law-suit that was not compromised
without difficulty. About this time, too, Foote, according to Boswell,
announced his intention of bringing Dr. Johnson on the stage; but
the threat of a public chastisement, with which "Surly Sam" threatened
him, induced him to abandon his intention. "What is the price
of a good thick stick?" said the Doctor on this remarkable occasion.
"A shilling," replied the individual to whom he put the question.
"Then go, and buy me a half-crown one; for if that rascal, Foote,
persists in his attempt to mimic me, I will step from the boxes,
thrash him publicly before the audience, and then make them a
speech in justification of my conduct." It is almost to be regretted
that the satirist gave up his design, for a capital Philippic has been
thereby lost to the world.</p>

<p class="indent">From this period Foote chiefly confined himself to the
Haymarket, where appeared in succession his "Mayor of Garratt," "Patron,"
and "Commissary." The first, which was founded on the whimsical
custom, now discontinued, of choosing a mock M.P. for the village
of Garratt in Surrey, is a laughable hit at the warlike propensities of
cockney volunteers. After some years' neglect, it was revived with
success during the height of the anti-Jacobin phrensy,
when Major Sturgeons again sprung up as plentiful as mushrooms,&mdash;when every
tailor strutted a hero, and every Alderman felt himself a William Tell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Foote was now afloat on the full tide of prosperity, drawing
crowded houses whenever he performed; patronised by the nobility, at
whose tables he was a sort of privileged guest; and everywhere
acknowledged as the great lion of the day. In the year 1766, when
on a visit with the Duke of York at Lord Mexborough's, he had the
misfortune to break his leg by a fall from his horse in hunting. A
silly peer condoling with him shortly afterwards on this accident, the
wag replied, "Pray, my lord, do not allude to my weak point, I have
not alluded to yours," at the same time pointing significantly to the
nobleman's head.</p>

<p class="indent">By this misfortune Foote was withdrawn some months from his
profession, but on his recovery he purchased the Haymarket, and opened
it with an extravaganza entitled "The Tailors, or a Tragedy for Warm
Weather." The next year appeared his "Devil on Two Sticks," the
machinery of which is derived from the "Diable Boiteux" of Le Sage.
This play, which was a severe satire on those medical quacks who
then, as now, infested the metropolis, was so popular, that its author
cleared upwards of three thousand pounds by it, but, a few weeks
after, lost it all by gambling at Bath.</p>

<p class="indent">Foote's next production was the "Maid of Bath", which was
performed in the year 1771. The principal characters in this comedy&mdash;Flint,
the avaricious old bachelor, and Miss Linnet, the vocalist to
whom he is represented as paying his addresses,&mdash;were portraits from
life; the former having been intended for Walter Long, a rich
Somersetshire squire, who died in 1807 at the age of ninety-five,
leaving property to the amount of a quarter of a million sterling to
Miss Tilney Long, who married the present Mr. Wellesley; and the
latter for the beautiful Miss Linley, afterwards Mrs. Sheridan. The
"Maid of Bath" is a lively play, containing one or two terse, brilliant
witticisms worthy of Congreve; such, for instance as the definition
of marriage,&mdash;that it is like "bobbing for a single eel in a
barrel of snakes." Its best-sustained character is that of Flint; in
sketching which, Foote had evidently in view the Athenian miser
alluded to by Horace, for he makes him say, "Ay, you may rail, and
the people may hiss; but what care I? I have that at home which
will keep up my spirits,"&mdash;which is a manifest paraphrase from</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&mdash;&mdash;"Populus me sibilat; at mihi plaudo</span>
<span class="i4">Ipse domi, simul ac nummos contemplor in arcâ."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">This comedy is further deserving of notice, as showing the
exquisite tact and readiness with which Foote availed himself of the floating
topics of the day. At the time it appeared, the town was greatly diverted
by a squabble between Wilkes and the notorious political parson
John Horne, afterwards Horne Tooke, the latter of whom accused
the former of having sold some rich court-dresses which he had entrusted
to his care at Paris. In allusion to this amusing quarrel,
Flint says, speaking of the clergyman whom he has engaged to marry
him to Miss Linnet, "You have seen friend Button, the Minister that
has come down to tack us together; he don't care much to meddle
with the pulpit, but he is a prodigious patriot, and a great politician
to boot; and, moreover, he has left behind him at Paris a choice collection
of curious rich clothes, which he has promised to sell me cheap."</p>

<p class="indent">The "Maid of Bath" was followed by the "Nabob" and the
"Bankrupt," the first of which was an effective attack on the habits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
of many of those old curmudgeons who, about the middle of the
last century&mdash;the period of Anglo-Indian prosperity&mdash;returned with
dried livers from the East, rich as Chartres, and equally profligate;
and the last, on the crazy commercial speculations of the day. The
sketch of Sir Robert Riscounter in the "Bankrupt" is supposed to
have been meant for the well-known Sir George Fordyce, who failed,
in the year 1772, for an almost unparalleled amount. Of these two
plays, the "Nabob" is the most carefully finished; but its breadth
and grossness must ever prevent its revival.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1774 came out the "Cozeners," a pungent satire on the
venal politicians of the day. The corruption which had been sanctioned
and made systematic by Walpole and the Pelhams, was then
in the full vigour of its rank luxuriance; every man had his price;
never therefore was satire better applied than this of Foote's. The
"Mrs. Fleec'em" of the "Cozeners," a lady of accommodating virtue,
and somewhat relaxed in her notions of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>, was
intended for the notorious Mrs. Catherine Rudd, who, after inducing the
two brothers (Perreau) to commit forgery, gave evidence against them,
on the strength of which they were hanged. Yet this creature,
tainted as she was with the foulest moral leprosy, was admitted into
the best society, and died at a good old age with the character of a
discreet, respectable matron!</p>

<p class="indent">We come now to Foote's last production. In the year 1775,
the famous Duchess of Kingston was tried before the House of Lords for
bigamy, and found guilty. Her case excited extraordinary interest
throughout the country; availing himself of which, Foote introduced
her in the "Trip to Calais" under the character of Lady Kitty Crocodile,
which coming to her Grace's ears, she procured its prohibition
by the Lord Chamberlain, and, not content with this measure of retaliation,
got up through her minions of the press, of whom she had
numbers in her pay, a charge against Foote of a most odious complexion,&mdash;so
odious, indeed, that he had no alternative but to demand
an instant public trial, which ended, as might have been anticipated,
in his triumphant acquittal. But this result, satisfactory as it was,
had no power to restore him to his wonted peace of mind. The
dagger had struck home to the heart. His friends, too, for the first
time, began to look coolly on him; the anonymous agents of the
Duchess still pursued him with unrelenting acrimony; many of those
whose follies and crimes he had lashed, but who had feared to retort
in his hour of pride, swelled the clamour against him; and he found
himself, in the decline of health and manhood, becoming just as unpopular
as he once was the reverse. In vain he endeavoured to rally
and make head against this combination; his moral fortitude wholly
deserted him; and after performing a few times, after his trial, at the
Haymarket, but with none of his former vivacity, he was seized with
a sudden paralytic affection, and bade adieu to the stage for ever.</p>

<p class="indent">About six months subsequent to his retirement, he was
attacked by a complaint which ultimately terminated his life; and, by his
physician's order, quitted London for the Continent, with a view to pass
the winter at Paris. But his constitution was too much shattered to
admit of the fatigue of such a journey, and he was compelled to halt at
Dover, where, on the morning after his arrival, a violent shivering
fit came over him while seated at the breakfast table, which in a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
hours put an end to his existence. No sooner was his death known
in the metropolis, than a re-action commenced in his favour. It was
then discovered that, with all his errors, he had been "more sinned
against than sinning;" and some of his friends even went the length
of proposing the erection of a monument to his memory! Just in
the same way, a few years later, was Burns treated by the world.
He, too, was alternately caressed and vilified; and finally hurried to
a premature grave, the victim of a broken heart. But this is the
penalty that superior genius must ever be prepared to pay. It walks
alone along a dizzy, dangerous height, the observed of all eyes; while
gregarious common-place treads, secure and unnoticed, along the
tame, flat "Bedford level" of ordinary life!</p>

<p class="indent">Having closed our brief memoir of Foote, it remains to say
a few words of his literary peculiarities. His humour was decidedly
Aristophanic; that is to say, broad, easy, reckless, satirical, without
the slightest alloy of <i>bonhommie</i>, and full of the directest
personalities. There is no playfulness or good-nature in his comedies. You
laugh, it is true, at his portraits, but at the same time you hold them in
contempt; for there is nothing redeeming in their eccentricities;
nothing for your esteem and admiration to lay hold of. We cannot
gather from his writings, as we can from every page of Goldsmith,
that Foote possessed the slightest sympathies with humanity. He
seems everywhere to hold it at arm's length, as worthy of nought but
the must supercilious treatment; which accounts for, and to a certain
extent justifies, the treatment he received from the world in his
latter days. Foote could never have drawn a "Good-natured Man,"
or even a "Dennis Brulgruddery;" for, though he may have possessed
the head to do so, yet he lacked the requisite sensibility. So greatly
deficient is he in this respect, that, whenever he attempts to put forth
a refined or generous sentiment, he almost always overdoes it, and
degenerates into cant. Yet his characters&mdash;with the exception of his
virtuous and moral ones, which are the most insipid in the world&mdash;are
admirably drawn, are sustained with unflagging spirit, and evince a wide
range of observation which, however, rarely pierces beyond the surface.</p>

<p class="indent">As works of art, Foote's dramas are by no means of first-rate
excellence. They show no fancy, no invention, no ingenuity in constructing,
or tact in developing plot; but are merely a collection of
scenes and incidents huddled confusedly together for the purpose of
drawing out the peculiarities of some two or three pet characters.
The best thing we can say of them is, that they exhibit everywhere
the keenness, the readiness, the self-possession, of the disciplined
man of the world, combined with a pungent malicious humour that
reminds us of a Mephistopheles in his merriest mood. It must also
be urged in their favour, that they are, in every sense of the word,
original. Foote copied no model, but painted direct from the life.
He took no hints from others, but gave his own fresh impressions of
character. He did not draw on his fancy, like Congreve, or study
to make points like Sheridan, but availed himself hastily of such materials
as came readiest to hand. The very extravagances of his
early life were in his favour, by bringing him in contact with those
marked, out-of-the-way characters, who, like Arabs, hang loose on
the skirts of society, and constitute the quintessence of comedy.
Thus his inveterate love of gambling furnished him with his masterly
sketch of Dick Loader; and his long-continued residence at
Paris&mdash;into whose various dissipations he entered with all the zeal of
a devotee&mdash;with his successful hits at the absurdities of our travelled fops.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Foote's three best plays are his "Minor," his "Liar," and
his "Mayor of Garratt." Perhaps the last is his masterpiece; for it is
alive and bustling throughout, is finished with more than the author's
ordinary care, and contains two characters penned in his truest <i>con
amore</i> spirit. Jerry Sneak and Major Sturgeon are, in their line, the
two most perfect delineations of which the minor British drama can
boast. There is no mistaking their identity. They speak the
genuine, unadulterated vulgar tongue of the City. Their sentiments
are cockney; their meanness and their bluster, their pompous self-conceit
and abject humility, are cockney; they are cockney all over
from the crown of the head to the sole of the shoe. What a rich set-off
to the "marchings and counter-marchings" of the one, is the
other's recital of his domestic grievances! Jerry's complaint that his
wife only allows him "two shillings for pocket-money," and helps him
to "all the cold vittles at table," is absolutely pathetic, if&mdash;as Hazlitt
observes&mdash;"the last stage of human imbecility can be called so."
While Bow bells ring, and St. Paul's church overlooks Cheapside,
Foote's cockneys shall endure. Nevertheless, while we acknowledge
their excellence, we entertain the most intense contempt for them,
and feel the strongest possible inclination to fling the Major into a
horse-pond, and smother Jerry Sneak in a basin of water-gruel.</p>

<p class="indent">Foote's conversational abilities were, if possible, superior
to his literary ones. For men of the world, in particular, they must have had
an inexpressible charm. There is no wit on record who has said so
many good things, or with such perfect ease and readiness. Foote
never laid a pun-trap to catch the unwary. He had humour at will,
and had no need to resort to artifice. His mind was well, but not
abundantly stored; and he had the tact to make his knowledge appear
greater than it really was. The most sterling testimony that has
been borne to his colloquial powers, is that furnished by Dr. Johnson,
who says, "The first time I was in company with Foote, was at Fitzherbert's.
Having no good opinion of the fellow, I was resolved not
to be pleased; and it is very difficult to please a man against his will.
I went on eating my dinner pretty sullenly, affecting not to mind
him; but the dog was so very comical, that I was obliged to lay down
my knife and fork, and fairly laugh it out. Sir, he was irresistible."
Foote's favourite butt was Garrick, whose thrifty habits he was constantly
turning into ridicule. Being one day in company with him, when
after satirizing some individual, David had wound up his attack by
saying, "Well, well, perhaps before I condemn another, I should pull
the <i>beam</i> out of my own eye," Foote replied. "And so you would,
if you could <i>sell the timber</i>." On another occasion, when they were
dining together, Garrick happened to let a guinea drop on the floor.
"Where has it gone to?" asked Foote, looking about for it. "Oh,
to the devil, I suppose," was the reply. "Ah, David," rejoined his
tormentor, "you can always contrive to make a guinea go farther
than any one else."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Such was Samuel Foote,&mdash;the wit, the satirist,
the humourist&mdash;whose life inculcates this wholesome truth, that those who
set themselves up, with no superior moral qualifications to recommend them,
to ridicule the follies and lash the vices of the age, but "sow the
wind, to reap the whirlwind!"

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE TWO BUTLERS.</h2>

<p class="indent">In all countries and all languages we have the story of
<i>Il Bondocani</i>. May I tell one from Ireland?</p>

<p class="indent">It is now almost a hundred years ago&mdash;certainly eighty&mdash;since
Tom&mdash;I declare to Mnemosyne I forget what his surname was, if I ever
knew it, which I doubt,&mdash;It is at least eighty years since Tom emerged
from his master's kitchen in Clonmell, to make his way on a visit to foreign countries.</p>

<p class="indent">If I can well recollect dates, this event must have occurred
at the end of the days of George the Second, or very close after the accession
of George the Third, because in the course of the narrative it
will be disclosed that the tale runs of a Jacobite lord living quietly
in Ireland, and that I think must have been some time between 1740
and 1760,&mdash;or say 65. Just before the year of the young Pretender's
burst, a sharp eye used to be kept upon the "honest men" in all the
three kingdoms; and in Ireland, from the peculiar power which the
surveillance attendant on the penal laws gave the government, this
sharp eye could not be surpassed in sharpness,&mdash;that is to say, if it
did not choose to wink. Truth, nevertheless, makes us acknowledge
that the authorities of Ireland were ever inclined at the bottom of
their hearts to countenance lawlessness, if at all recommended by
anything like a noble or a romantic name. And no name could be
more renowned or more romantic than that of Ormond.</p>

<p class="indent">It is to be found in all our histories well recorded. What
are the lines of Dryden?&mdash;and Dryden was a man who knew how to make
verses worth reading.</p>

<p class="indent">And the rebel rose stuck to the house of Ormond for many a
day;&mdash;but it is useless to say more. Even I who would sing "Lilla bullalero
bullen a la,"&mdash;if I could, only I can't sing,&mdash;and who give "The
glorious, pious, and immortal memory," because I can toast,&mdash;even I
do not think wrong of the house of Ormond for sticking as it did to
the house of Stuart. Of that too I have a long story to tell some time or another.</p>

<p class="indent">Never mind. I was mentioning all this, because I have not
a 'Peerage' by me; and I really do not know who was the Lord Ormond of
the day which I take to be the epoch of my tale. If I had a 'Peerage,'
I am sure I could settle it in a minute; but I have none. Those,
therefore, who are most interested in the affair ought to examine a
'Peerage,' to find who was the man of the time;&mdash;I can only help
them by a hint. My own particular and personal reason for recollecting
the matter is this: I am forty, or more&mdash;never mind the
quantity more; and I was told the story by my uncle at least
five-and-twenty years ago. That brings us to the year 1812,&mdash;say 1811.
My uncle&mdash;his name was Jack&mdash;told me that he had heard the
story from Tom himself fifty years before that. If my uncle Jack,
who was a very good fellow, considerably given to potation, was
precise in his computation of time, the date of his story must have
fallen in 1762&mdash;or 1763&mdash;no matter which. This brings me near
the date I have already assigned; but the reader of my essay has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
before him the grounds of my chronological conjectures, and he can
form his opinions on <i>data</i> as sufficiently as myself.</p>

<p class="indent">I recur fearlessly to the fact that Tom&mdash;whatever his
surname may have been&mdash;emerged from the kitchen of his master in Clonmell,
to make his way to foreign countries.</p>

<p class="indent">His master was a very honest fellow&mdash;a schoolmaster of
the name of Chaytor, a Quaker, round of paunch and red of nose. I believe
that some of his progeny are now men of office in Tipperary&mdash;and
why should they not? Summer school-vacations in Ireland occur
in July; and Chaytor&mdash;by the bye, I think he was <i>Tom</i> Chaytor, but
if Quakers have Christian names I am not sure,&mdash;gave leave to his
man Tom to go wandering about the country. He had four, or perhaps
five, days to himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom, as he was described to me by my uncle over a jug of
punch about a quarter of a century ago, was what in his memory must have
been a smart-built fellow. Clean of limb, active of hand, light of leg,
clear of eye, bright of hair, white of tooth, and two-and-twenty; in
short, he was as handsome a lad as you would wish to look upon in a
summer's day. I mention a summer's day merely for its length; for
even on a winter's day there were few girls that could cast an eye
upon him without forgetting the frost.</p>

<p class="indent">So he started for the land of Kilkenny, which is what we
used to call in Ireland twenty-four miles from Clonmell. They have stretched
it now to thirty; but I do not find it the longer or shorter in walking
or chalking. However, why should we gamble at an act of "justice
to Ireland?" Tom at all events cared little for the distance; and,
going it at a slapping pace, he made Kilkenny in six hours. I pass
the itinerary. He started at six in the morning, and arrived somewhat
foot-worn, but full not only of bread, but of wine, (for wine was
to be found on country road-sides in Ireland in those days,) in the
ancient city of Saint Canice about noon.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom refreshed himself at the Feathers, kept in those
days by a man named Jerry Mulvany, who was supposed to be more nearly
connected with the family of Ormond than the rites of the church
could allow; and having swallowed as much of the substantial food and
the pestiferous fluid that mine host of the Feathers tendered him, the
spirit of inquisitiveness, which, according to the phrenologists, is
developed in all mankind, seized paramount hold of Tom.
Tom&mdash;? ay, Tom it must be, for I really cannot recollect his other name.</p>

<p class="indent">If there be a guide-book to the curiosities of Kilkenny, the
work has escaped my researches. Of the city it is recorded, however, that
it can boast of fire without smoke, air without fog, and streets paved
with marble. And there's the college, and the bridge, and the ruins
of St. John's abbey, and St. Canice, and the Nore itself, and last, not
least, the castle of the Ormonds, with its woods and its walks, and
its stables and its gallery, and all the rest of it, predominating over
the river. It is a very fine-looking thing indeed; and, if I mistake
not, John Wilson Croker, in his youth, wrote a poem to its honour,
beginning with</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">"High on the sounding banks of Nore,"</p>

<p>every verse of which ended with "The castle," in the manner
of Cowper's "My Mary," or Ben Jonson's "Tom Tosspot." If I had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
poem, I should publish it here with the greatest pleasure; but I have
it not. I forget where I saw it, but I think it was in a Dublin magazine
of a good many years ago, when I was a junior sophister of T. C. D.</p>

<p class="indent">Let the reader, then, in the absence of this document, imagine
that the poem was infinitely fine, and that the subject was worthy of the
muse. As the castle is the most particular lion of the city, it of
course speedily attracted the attention of Tom, who, swaggering in
all the independence of an emancipated footman up the street, soon
found himself at the gate. "Rearing himself thereat," as the old ballad
has it, stood a man basking in the sun. He was somewhat declining
towards what they call the vale of years in the language of
poetry; but by the twinkle of his eye, and the purple rotundity of his
cheek, it was evident that the years of the valley, like the lads of the
valley, had gone cheerily-o! The sun shone brightly upon his silver
locks, escaping from under a somewhat tarnished cocked-hat guarded
with gold lace, the gilding of which had much deteriorated since it
departed from the shop of the artificer; and upon a scarlet waistcoat,
velvet certainly, but of reduced condition, and in the same situation
as to gilding as the hat. His plum-coloured breeches were unbuckled
at the knee, and his ungartered stockings were on a downward
progress towards his unbuckled shoes. He had his hands&mdash;their
wrists were garnished with unwashed ruffles&mdash;in his breeches pockets;
and he diverted himself with whistling "Charley over the water," in
a state of <i>quasi</i>-ruminant quiescence. Nothing could be plainer than
that he was a hanger-on of the castle off duty, waiting his time until
called for, when of course he was to appear before his master in a
more carefully arranged costume.</p>

<p class="indent">Ormond Castle was then, as I believe it is now, a show-house,
and the visitors of Kilkenny found little difficulty in the admission;
but, as in those days purposes of political intrusion might be suspected,
some shadow at least of introduction was considered necessary.
Tom, reared in the household of a schoolmaster, where the despotic
authority of the chief extends a flavour of its quality to all his ministers,
exhilarated by the walk, and cheered by the eatables and drinkables
which he had swallowed, felt that there was no necessity for
consulting any of the usual points of etiquette, if indeed he knew that
any such things were in existence.</p>

<p class="indent">"I say," said he, "old chap! is this castle to be seen?
I'm told it's a show; and if it is, let's have a look at it."</p>

<p class="indent">"It is to be seen," replied the person addressed,
"if you are properly introduced."</p>

<p class="indent">"That's all hum!" said Tom. "I know enough of the world,
though I've lived all my life in Clonmell, to know that a proper
introduction signifies a tester. Come, my old snouty, I'll stand all
that's right if you show me over it. Can you do it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why," said his new friend, "I think I can;
because, in fact, I am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Something about the house, I suppose. Well, though you've
on a laced jacket, and I only a plain frieze coat, we are both brothers of
the shoulder-knot. I tell you who I am. Did you ever hear of
Chaytor the Quaker, the schoolmaster of Clonmell?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Never."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Well, he's a decent sort of fellow in the <i>propria qu&aelig;
maribus</i> line, and gives as good a buttock of beef to anybody that gets over
the threshold of his door as you'd wish to meet; and I am his man,&mdash;his
valley de sham, head gentleman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Gentleman usher?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, not usher," responded Tom indignantly: "I have
nothing to do with ushers; they are scabby dogs of poor scholards, sizards,
half-pays, and the like; and all the young gentlemen much prefer me:&mdash;but
I am his <i>fiddleus Achates</i>, as master Jack Toler calls me,&mdash;that's
a purty pup who will make some fun some of these days,&mdash;his
whacktotum, head-cook, and dairy-maid, slush, and butler. What are you here?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why," replied the man at the gate,
"I am a butler as well as you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! then we're both butlers; and you could as well pass
us in. By coarse, the butler must be a great fellow here; and I see you are
rigged out in the cast clothes of my lord. Isn't that true?"</p>

<p class="indent">"True enough: he never gets a suit of clothes that it does not
fall to my lot to wear it; but if you wish to see the castle, I think I can
venture to show you all that it contains, even for the sake of our being
two butlers."</p>

<p class="indent">It was not much sooner said than done. Tom accompanied his
companion over the house and grounds, making sundry critical observations
on all he saw therein,&mdash;on painting, architecture, gardening,
the sublime and beautiful, the scientific and picturesque,&mdash;in a manner
which I doubt not much resembled the average style of reviewing
those matters in what we now call the best public instructors.</p>

<p class="indent">"Rum-looking old ruffians!" observed Tom, on casting his
eyes along the gallery containing the portraitures of the Ormondes. "Look
at that fellow there all battered up in iron; I wish to God I had as
good a church as he would rob!"</p>

<p class="indent">"He was one of the old earls," replied his guide, "in the
days of Henry the Eighth; and I believe he did help in robbing churches."</p>

<p class="indent">"I knew it by his look," said Tom; "and there's a chap there in
a wilderness of a wig. Gad! he looks as if he was like to be hanged."</p>

<p class="indent">"He was so," said the cicerone; "for a gentleman of the
name of Blood was about to pay him that compliment at Tyburn."</p>

<p class="indent">"Serve him right," observed Tom; "and this fellow with the
short stick in his hand;&mdash;what the deuce is the meaning of
that?&mdash;was he a constable?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No," said his friend, "he was a marshal; but he had much
to do with keeping out of the way of constables for some years. Did you
ever hear of Dean Swift?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Did I ever hear of the Dane? Why, my master has
twenty books of his that he's always reading, and he calls him Old
Copper-farthing; and the young gentlemen are quite wild to read them. I
read some of them wance (once); but they were all lies, about fairies
and giants. Howsoever, they say the Dane was a larned man."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, he was a great friend of that man
with the short stick in his hand."</p>

<p class="indent">"By dad!" said Tom, "few of the Dane's friends was friends to
the Hanover succession; and I'd bet anything that that flourishing-looking
lad there was a friend to the Pretender."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"It is likely that if you laid such a bet you would win it.
He was a great friend also of Queen Anne. Have you ever heard of her?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Heard of Brandy Nan! To be sure I did&mdash;merry be the first
of August! But what's the use of looking at those queer old fools?&mdash;I
wonder who bothered themselves painting them?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I do not think you knew the people;&mdash;they
were Vandyke, Lely, Kneller."</p>

<p class="indent">"I never heard of them in Clonmell," remarked Tom.
"Have you anything to drink?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Plenty."</p>

<p class="indent">"But you won't get into a scrape? Honour above all; I'd not
like to have you do it unless you were sure, for the glory of the cloth."</p>

<p class="indent">The pledge of security being solemnly offered, Tom followed
his companion through the intricate passages of the castle until he came
into a small apartment, where he found a most plentiful repast before
him. He had not failed to observe, that, as he was guided through
the house, their path had been wholly uncrossed, for, if anybody
accidentally appeared, he hastily withdrew. One person only was detained
for a moment, and to him the butler spoke a few words in
some unknown tongue, which Tom of course set down as part of the
Jacobite treason pervading every part of the castle.</p>

<p class="indent">"Gad!" said he, while beginning to lay into the round of
beef, "I am half inclined to think that the jabber you talked just now to
the powder-monkey we met in that corridor was not treason, but beef and
mustard: an't I right?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Quite so."</p>

<p class="indent">"Fall to, then, yourself. By Gad! you appear to have those
lads under your thumb&mdash;for this is great eating. I suppose you often rob
my lord?&mdash;speak plain, for I myself rob ould Chaytor the schoolmaster;
but there's a long difference between robbing a schoolmaster
and robbing a lord. I venture to say many a pound of his you have
made away with."</p>

<p class="indent">"A great many indeed. I am ashamed to say it, that for one
pound he has lost by anybody else, he has lost a hundred by me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ashamed, indeed! This is beautiful beef. But let us
wash it down. By the powers! is it champagne you are giving me? Well,
I never drank but one glass of it in my life, and that was from a
bottle that I stole out of a dozen which the master had when he was
giving a great dinner to the fathers of the boys just before the
Christmas holidays the year before last. My service to you. By Gor!
if you do not break the Ormonds, I can't tell who should."</p>

<p class="indent">"Nor I. Finish your champagne.
What else will you have to drink?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Have you the run of the cellar?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, then, claret is genteel; but the little I drank of
it was mortal cold. Could you find us a glass of brandy?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course:" and on the sounding of a bell there appeared
the same valet who had been addressed in the corridor; and in the same
language some intimation was communicated, which in a few moments
produced a bottle of Nantz, rare and particular, placed before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
Tom with all the emollient appliances necessary for turning it into punch.</p>

<p class="indent">"By all that's bad," said the Clonmellian butler, "but
ye keep these fellows to their knitting. This is indeed capital stuff. Make
for yourself. When you come to Clonmell, ask for me&mdash;Tom&mdash;at old
Chaytor's, the Quaker schoolmaster, a few doors from the Globe.
This lord of yours, I am told, is a bloody Jacobite: here's the Hanover
succession! but we must not drink that here, for perhaps the
old fellow himself might hear us."</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing is more probable."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, then, mum's the word. I'm told he puts white roses
in his dog's ears, and drinks a certain person over the water on the tenth
of June; but, no matter, this is his house, and you and I are drinking
his drink,&mdash;so, why should we wish him bad luck? If he was hanged,
of course I'd go to see him, to be sure; would not you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I should certainly be there."</p>

<p class="indent">By this time Tom was subdued by the champagne and the brandy,
to say nothing of the hot weather; and the spirit of hospitality rose
strong upon the spirit of cognac. His new friend gently hinted that
a retreat to his <i>gîte</i> at the Feathers would be prudent; but to
such a step Tom would by no means consent unless the butler of the
castle accompanied him to take a parting bowl. With some reluctance the
wish was complied with, and both the butlers sallied forth on their
way through the principal streets of Kilkenny, just as the evening
was beginning to assume somewhat of a dusky hue. Tom had, in the
course of the three or four hours passed with his new friend, informed
him of all the private history of the house of Ormond, with that same
regard to veracity which in general characterises the accounts of the
births, lives, and educations of persons of the higher classes, to be
found in fashionable novels and other works drawn from the communications
of such authorities as our friend Tom; and his companion
offered as much commentary as is usually done on similar occasions.
Proceeding in a twirling motion along, he could not but observe
that the principal persons whom they met bowed most respectfully
to the gentleman from the castle; and, on being assured that this
token of deference was paid because they were tradesmen of the
castle, who were indebted to the butler for his good word in their
business, Tom's appreciation of his friend's abilities in the art of
"improving" his situation was considerably enhanced. He calculated
that if they made money by the butler, the butler made money
by them; and he determined that on his return to Clonmell he too
would find tradesfolks ready to take hats off to him in the ratio of
pedagogue to peer.</p>

<p class="indent">The Kilkenny man steadied the Clonmell man to the Feathers,
where the latter most potentially ordered a bowl of the best punch.
The slipshod waiter stared; but a look from Tom's friend was enough.
They were ushered into the best apartment of the house,&mdash;Tom remarking
that it was a different room from that which he occupied on
his arrival; and in a few minutes the master of the house, Mr. Mulvany,
in his best array, made his appearance with a pair of wax candles
in his hands. He bowed to the earth as he said,</p>

<p class="indent">"If I had expected you, my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Leave the room," was the answer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Not before I order my bowl of punch," said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"Shall I, my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," said the person addressed; "whatever he likes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," said Tom, as Mulvany left the room, "if I ever
saw anything to match that. Is he one of the tradespeople of the castle?
This does bate everything. And, by dad, he's not unlike you in the
face, neither! Och! then, what a story I'll have when I get back to
Clonmell."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Tom," said his friend, "I may perhaps see you there;
but good-b'ye for a moment. I assure you I have had much pleasure in your company."</p>

<p class="indent">"He's a queer fellow that," thought Tom, "and I hope he'll
be soon back. It's a pleasant acquaintance I've made the first day I
was in Kilkenny. Sit down, Mr. Mulvany," said he, as that functionary
entered, bearing a bowl of punch, "and taste your brewing." To
which invitation Mr. Mulvany acceded, nothing loth, but still casting
an anxious eye towards the door.</p>

<p class="indent">"That's a mighty honest man," said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"I do not know what you mean," replied the cautious Mulvany;
(for, "honest man" was in those days another word for Jacobite.)</p>

<p class="indent">"I mane what I say," said Tom; "he's just showed me over the
castle, and gave me full and plenty of the best of eating and drinking.
He tells me he's the butler."</p>

<p class="indent">"And so he is, you idiot of a man!" cried Mulvany. "He's the
chief Butler of Ireland."</p>

<p class="indent">"What?" said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, him that was with you just now is the Earl of Ormond."</p>

<p>My story is over&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6em;">"And James Fitzjames was Scotland's king."</p>

<p class="indent">All the potations pottle-deep, the road-side drinking, the
champagne, the cognac, the punch of the Feathers, vanished at once from
Tom's brain, to make room for the recollection of what he had been
saying for the last three hours. Waiting for no further explanation,
he threw up the window, (they were sitting on a ground-floor,) and,
leaving Mr. Mulvany to finish the bowl as he pleased, proceeded at a
hand-canter to Clonmell, not freed from the apparition of Lord Ormond
before he had left Kilcash to his north; and nothing could ever
again induce him to wander in the direction of Kilkenny, there to run
the risk of meeting with his fellow-butler, until his lordship was so
safely bestowed in the family vault as to render the chance of collision
highly improbable. Such is my <i>Il Bondocani</i>.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE BIT OF TAPE.</h2>
<p class="f90 space-below1">BY RICHARD JOHNS, ESQ.</p>

<p class="indent">"Slow and sure" has been the motto of my family from
generation to generation, and wonderfully has it prospered by acting on
this maxim; the misfortunes of the house of Slowby having apparently
been reserved for the only active and enterprising individual
ever born unto that name. Reader, I am that unhappy man! Waiters
upon Fortune, plentifully have all my progenitors fared from the
dainties of the good lady's table; while I, in my anxiety to share
in the feast, have generally upset the board, and lost every thing
in the scramble.</p>

<p class="indent">Sir James Slowby, my worthy father, was a younger son, and
his portion had been little more than the blessing of a parent, conveyed
in the form of words always used in our family&mdash;"Bless thee,
my son; be slow and sure, and you will be sure to get on." He did
get on; for, was he not one of the feelers of that huge polypus in
society, the Slowbys? Ways of making money, which other men
had diligently sought in vain, discovered themselves to him; places
were conferred on him, and legacies left him, for no one reason
that could be discovered, except that he seemed indifferent to such
matters, and latterly became so wealthy, that he did not require
them. He was slow in marrying; not entering the "holy state"
till he was forty. He did not wed a fortune: no! he rather preferred
a woman of good expectations; and these were, of course,
realised,&mdash;the money came "slow and sure." He lived to a good
old age; but death, though slow, was sure also; and he at length
died, leaving two sons: on one he bestowed all his wealth; the other,
my luckless self, he left a beggarly dependent on an elder brother's
bounty. The fact of the matter was, I had too much vivacity to
please so true a Slowby as my father; while James was a man
after his own heart: and, perhaps I had circulated a little too much
of the old gentleman's money in what he strangely called my "loose
kind of life;" but which I only denominated "living fast." He
might have confessed that I was not altogether selfish in my pleasures.
I often made my father most magnificent presents; and
though, perhaps, he ultimately had to pay the bills, the generosity
of the intention was the same.</p>

<p class="indent">The following letters were written just before our worthy
parent's death, by his two sons. James was at the paternal mansion
in &mdash;&mdash; Square, I at a little road-side public-house about four and
twenty miles from Newmarket. I must premise that I was thus far
on my way to London, in answer to my brother's summons; but,
at "Ugley" over the post-chaise went&mdash;a wheel was broken, and so
was my left arm. The post-boys swore it was my fault, because I
had not patience to have the wheels properly greased; and I, because
it was my misfortune to be obliged to delay my journey till the
mischief was repaired&mdash;I mean as regards the <span class="smcap">WEAL</span> of
my arm, not the wheel of the chaise,&mdash;for, had I been able, I would rather have
ridden one of the post-horses to the next stage, than not have pursued my route.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p class="author space-above1">"&mdash;&mdash; <i>Square.</i></p>
<p class="blockquot">&emsp;"<span class="smcap">My dear brother</span>,&mdash;Your
father requests that you will take
an early opportunity of coming to town, as he is supposed to be
on his death-bed. His will only awaits your arrival to receive signature.
Should you solemnly promise not to dissipate money as
you have heretofore done, he will leave you a gentlemanly competence.
Dr. Druget is of opinion that our father may live till Sunday
next; so, if you are here at any period before that date, you will be
in sufficient time for the above-mentioned purpose.</p>

<p class="author"><br />"Your affectionate brother,
<span class="smcap">James Slowby</span>."</p>

<p class="blockquot space-above1">&emsp;"<span class="smcap">Dear Jim</span>,&mdash;<i>You</i>
might think it wise to delay my seeing our
dear father, but <i>I</i> did not;&mdash;so started at once,&mdash;double-fee'd the
post-boys,&mdash;double feed for the horses,&mdash;away I bowled, till off came
the wheel at Ugley. Here I am, with a broken arm. Tell my father
I am cut to the quick that we may never meet again. I'll promise
any thing he likes. I now really see the folly of being always in
such a devil of a hurry; particularly in spending money, paying bills,
and that kind of thing: say that I will now for ever stick by the family
motto, 'slow and sure.' Yours in haste,</p>

<p class="author"><br />"<span class="smcap">Richard Slowby</span>.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"P.S. I send my own servant to ride whip and spur
till he puts this in your hands; he will beat the post by an hour and a half,
which is of consequence."</p>

<p class="indent space-above2">This latter epistle never reached its destination,&mdash;my
poor fellow broke his neck at Epping; and, as the letter was despatched in too
great haste to be fully directed, it was opened and returned to me by
the coroner in due course of post.</p>

<p class="indent">I did not get to town till long after the death of my father.
The will signed at last, my absence being unaccounted for, gave my
brother the whole property; nor did he seem inclined to part with a
shilling. A place in the T&mdash;&mdash;, which the head of our ancient house,
Lord Snaile, had bestowed on my father, and still promised to keep in
the family, might yet be mine,&mdash;I was his lordship's godson, and had
a fair chance for it; but the now Sir James Slowby, second of the
title, and worthy of the name, would not withdraw his claim as eldest born.</p>

<p class="indent">"I won't move in the matter, Richard," said my slow and
sure brother; "but if my lord gives me the offer, I will accept it. I am
not greedy after riches, Heaven knows; but it would be tempting
Providence not to hold what is put into my possession, nor freely
take what is freely given. His lordship has requested, by letter, that
we both wait upon him in Curzon Street, no doubt about the appointment;
he makes mention of wishing to introduce us to the
ladies, after 'the despatch of business.' Our cousin Maria used to be
lovely as a child, and, though not a fortune, may come in for something
considerable, ultimately."</p>

<p class="indent">Such was my brother's harangue. Sick of his prosing I left
his house, comforting myself that I had, at least, as much chance of the
appointment as he had; nor was I altogether without my hopes of
supplanting him with Maria, though <i>he</i> might be worthy of
wedding her at Marylebone; and I, even with her own special licence,
would have to journey on the same errand as far as Gretna.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">I dined that day at Norwood with an old schoolfellow. At
his house I was to pass the night, and on the morrow, at two o'clock, my
fate was to be decided. On this eventful morning I was set down in
Camberwell by my friend's phaeton. I had seen the Norwood four-horse
coach start for town long before we left home, and had given
myself great credit for not allowing it to convey me that I might
have from thence been enabled to intrude on Lord Snaile's privacy
an hour or two before I was expected. But I recollected I
had annoyed his lordship on more than one occasion in a similar
manner, and I seriously resolved that I would no longer mar my fortunes
by my precipitation. It was now, however, within two hours
of the time of appointment; my friend's vehicle was not going any
farther, and I might, at least, indulge myself by reaching Oxford
Street by the quickest public conveyance. Omnibuses had just been
introduced on that road; and the Red Rover, looking like a huge trap
for catching passengers, was drawn up at the end of Camberwell
Green. "Charing Cross, sir!"&mdash;"Oxford Street, sir!"&mdash;"Going directly,
sir!" was music to my ears, even from the cracked voice of a
cad, and in I unfortunately got; and there did I sit for ten minutes,
while coaches innumerable, passed me for London. Still I preserved
my patience, firm in my good resolves. At length another Westminster
omnibus drove up.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you going now; or are you not?" said I,
very properly restraining an oath just on the tip of my tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">"Going directly, sir&mdash;be in town long before him, sir,"
said the cad, pointing to the other 'bus, for he saw my eye was turned towards it.</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment a simple-looking servant-girl with a bandbox
came across the Green, and a fight commenced between the <i>conducteurs</i> of
the rival vehicles for the unfortunate woman, in which she got not
a little pulled about. The Red Rover, however, won the day; and
glad enough was I when we started, at a rattling pace. But my pleasure
was of short duration.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where are you going?" asked an old women opposite me, who
knew the road, which I did not.</p>

<p class="indent">"Going to take up, ma'am," said the cad. "We shall be back to
the Green Man in ten minutes if you've left any thing behind."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where is my bandbox?" said the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">"I knows nothing about it, not I; I suppose it went by the
other 'bus if you arn't a got it. Why did you let it out of your own hands,
young 'oman? That 'ere cad is the greatest thief on the road."</p>

<p class="indent">The girl began to cry, and declared she should lose her
place; and I to swear, for I thought it very likely I should lose mine. But
we at length once more passed the Green, and tore along at the rate of
ten miles an hour, till we set down passengers at the Elephant and
Castle. Reader, do you happen to know a biscuit-shop occupying
the corner of the road to Westminster, opposite the aforesaid Elephant
and Castle? There it was, the Red Rover drew up, and the
cad descended to run after a man and woman, who seemed undetermined
whether they would take six-pennyworth or not. My patience
was now quite exhausted. A four-horse Westminster coach was just
starting across the way, and, determined to get a place in a more
expeditious conveyance, I dashed open the door of the omnibus just
as the <i>conducteur's</i> "all right" again set the carriage in motion; he,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
having failed in his canvassing, at the same instant jumped on the
step behind the 'bus. The consequences were direful. The cad
was transferred to the pavement by a swingeing blow on the temple
from the opening panel, while I lost my equilibrium, and made a full-length
prostration into mud four inches thick, which formed the
bed of the road. I had fallen face downward, and the infuriated official
of the 'bus quickly bestrode me, grasping me by the nape of the
neck. I gasped for breath. Never shall I forget what I then inhaled.
To bite the dust is always disagreeable; but, I can assure
you, it is nothing to a mouthful of mud. Rescued at last by the
intervention of the police, I was permitted to rise. I had no time to
dispute the question of right and wrong; glad enough was I to be
allowed to medicate the cad's promissory black eye with a sovereign;
for which I was declared by all present, and particularly by the man
what rides behind the 'homnibus' "to be a perfect gemman, only
a little hasty." Never was a gentleman in a worse pickle. The road
had been creamed by the <i>reign</i> of wet weather that marks an English
summer. Had I been diving in a mud-cart, or "far into the
bowels of the land," through the medium of a ditch in the neighbouring
St. George's Fields, I could not have presented a more extraordinary
appearance. I might have been rated as a forty-shilling landholder,
and rich soil into the bargain. As soon as I could clear my eyes
sufficiently to permit of the exercise of vision, I espied an old clothes'
shop in the distance; and in this welcome retreat I speedily bestowed
myself amid cries of "How are you off for soap?"&mdash;"There you go,
stick-in-the-mud!"&mdash;"Where did you lie last?" and other specimens
of suburban wit. Having left the admiring gaze of about two hundred
spectators, I obtained a washing-tub and a private room
from my newly-formed acquaintance, Isaacs; and, my ablutions
being complete, I equipped myself in a full suit of black, which,
though the habiliments were rather the worse for wear, fitted me
pretty well, and had been, withal, decently made. I was also supplied
with shirt and drawers, "goot ash new," and a hat which Isaacs
swore was only made the week before, and "cheap ash dirt." I appreciated
the simile, but the hat I could scarcely get on my head;
time was however wearing away, and I was obliged to have it, as well
as a pair of Blucher boots, not a Wellington fitting me in the Jew's
whole stock of such articles. I again started. There happened to
be a hackney-coach passing just as I emerged from the shop. This
was fortunate; for, to hide my low boots, Isaacs had strapped my
trousers down so tightly, that, not trusting much to the material, I
thought it might be advisable to avoid walking.</p>

<p class="indent">I had yet sufficient time before me to keep my appointment,
and I was now fairly on my way to Curzon Street; nothing interrupting
my meditation for the next half hour but the paying of a turnpike.
I had certainly met with many vexatious annoyances during the
morning; but I felt pleased with myself for so far conquering my
impetuous spirit as to have exhibited, on the whole, but little irritation
under my suffering. For this, I thought I deserved to succeed
in my present visit to that high-priest of Fortune, a patron. Then I
bethought me of Maria, and took a glance at my suit of black. I fancied
that I must look very like an undertaker,&mdash;I knew not why: I
had imagined myself perfectly gentlemanly in appearance when I left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
my toilet at Norwood, and I had only changed one suit of black for
another,&mdash;but then these were not made for me. Perhaps some poor
fellow had been hanged in them. I got nervous and miserable.</p>

<p class="indent">My hat galled my head; I removed it, and held it in my
hand. It certainly did not look like a new one. I was ingeniously tormenting
myself with calling to memory every disease of the scalp I had ever
heard of, when I reached the corner of Curzon Street; and, not wishing
to desecrate the portals of the fastidious peer by driving up in a
"Jarvey," I got out, and made my approach on foot. I had knocked&mdash;there
was a delay in opening the door. The porter is out of the
way, thought I; and I took an opportunity of looking at my heels, to see
if I had walked off with any straws from the coach. I heard the door
opening;&mdash;I say heard, for I did not look up, my eyes just then resting
on a small <i>piece of tape</i> that I had been dragging in the dirt&mdash;Oh!
luckless appurtenance of the drawers of the Jew!&mdash;Yes! the door
was opening to admit me to the presence of my noble relation&mdash;my
patron&mdash;who I trusted was waiting with an appointment of 1500<i>l.</i>
a-year, anxious to bestow it on his godson&mdash;the morning that was to
witness my introduction to her whom I had already wedded in my
imagination&mdash;I saw a little piece of tape dangling at my heels! Before
the portals of the mansion had quite gaped to receive me, my
finger was twisted round this cruel instrument of destiny, in the hope
of breaking it. I pulled. Acting like a knife on the trousers, fast
strapped to my boots, and too powerful a strain on the drawers,
though "goot ash new," both were rent to the waistband;&mdash;my coat
ripped at the shoulder by the action of my arm;&mdash;my hat fell off, and
was taken by the wind down the street;&mdash;and the servant, to whom,
having finished this ingenious operation, I stood fully disclosed,
unfortunately saw but the effects, without knowing the cause of
my disaster.</p>

<p class="indent">The man was too well-bred to remark my appearance, but
he had every reason for thinking me either mad or drunk; as, to crown all,
my face must have been flushed and distorted from rage and mortification.</p>

<p class="indent">"My lord expects you in the library, sir,"
said the astounded servant.</p>

<p class="indent">An abrupt "Tell my lord I'll call again" was my only reply,
delivered over my shoulder as I dashed from the door, perfectly unconscious
of what I was about, till I found myself in a tavern, the first
friendly door that was open to receive me. I here composed my bewildered
senses, despatched a messenger for a tailor, and set myself
down to concoct a note to Lord Snaile. But how narrate to the most
particular, matter-of-fact, and yet fastidious, man in the world the
events of that morning? I threw the pen and paper from me in despair.
Nothing now remained but to wait patiently, if possible, till I
could make my excuses in person.</p>

<p class="indent">The tailor came, and in about an hour and a half I was again
on my way to his lordship's residence; but alas! ere I reached it, I met my
steady young brother, who with much formality thus addressed me.</p>

<p class="indent">"Richard Slowby, your conduct this morning is the climax
of your excesses. His lordship requests that he may not in future be favoured
with your visits in Curzon Street; and I consider it my duty to inform
you, that these will be equally disagreeable in &mdash;&mdash; Square."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">I felt at that moment too proud to ask for, or offer, explanations.
I saw by the twinkle of his cold grey eye that <i>he</i> had received the
appointment, and of course it would have been against his principles
to resign it in my favour; so I merely told him that I should have
great pleasure in attending to the wishes of two men I so <i>equally</i>
respected as Lord Snaile and Sir James Slowby: and, bidding him a
very good morning, I left him to his self-gratulations.</p>

<p class="indent">About a twelvemonth afterwards, I elicited from the servant
who had opened the door to me, and delivered my unfortunate message to
his lordly master, the following particulars.</p>

<p class="indent">It appears that on the man entering the library he found
the peer and the baronet seated together, the eyes of the former fixed on a
time-piece, which told the startling fact that the hour of appointment
was past, by five minutes. "Is Mr. Slowby come?" said my lord,
turning suddenly towards the servant.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, my lord; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Show him in directly, sir. Did I not tell you I expected Mr.
Slowby, and ordered him to be admitted?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I told the gentleman so, my lord, and that you were
waiting for him, and he said he would call again. I am afraid the gentleman
is unwell, my lord."</p>

<p class="indent">"Unwell!" cried his lordship,
"and you allowed him to quit the house?"</p>

<p class="indent">"He ran away, my lord;" and here, not knowing how far
it would be safe to give the conclusion he had drawn from my extraordinary
manner and appearance, the man hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell me why, this instant, sir," exclaimed his master;
"there is some mystery, and I will know it."</p>

<p class="indent">"I beg pardon, my lord, but Mr. Slowby seemed much excited&mdash;was
without his hat, had torn clothes&mdash;scarcely decent, my lord. I
hope your lordship will excuse me, but the gentleman seemed flushed
with after-dinner indulgence in the morning, my lord."</p>

<p class="indent">On this well-bred announcement of my being drunk, the
peer and his companion exchanged significant looks.</p>

<p class="indent">"You may go," said my lord, bowing his head to the servant:
but ere my informant got further than the neutral ground between the
double doors, he heard my kind brother say, "Just like him;&mdash;dined
yesterday at Norwood."</p>

<p class="indent">"A disgrace to the family!" sorrowfully remarked his lordship.
"I had hoped to benefit him, but"&mdash;a pause&mdash;"the appointment is yours,
Sir John. I could not trust it with a man of his character."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">It is satisfactory to know the particulars of
one's misfortunes, and these were given me at the "Bear" in Piccadilly. After
being cut by all, as a graceless vagabond, when it was discovered that I had
few meals to say grace over, I am now considered dead to society; but I
am, in fact, "living for revenge." To spite the omnibuses, and abuse
the cads at my leisure, I drive a short stage out of town; and if any
gentleman knows one Dick Hastings, and will "please to remember
the coachman," he who will drink to his honour's good health will be
the luckless Richard Slowby.

<p class="indent space-above2">"It may be observed," (says a newspaper in our
hand, quite as correctly informed as newspapers usually are,) "that the railway
companies now forming, of which we have a list before us, require a
capital of upwards of thirty millions of pounds, divided into nearly
five hundred thousand shares."</p>

<p class="indent">This was in the year 1836; and the horror it excited in the
race of horses, native and foreign, inhabitants of the British empire, is not to
be described. A knowledge of the habits and intelligence of this
species is only to be obtained from the writings of our matter-of-fact
and lamented predecessor, Captain Lemuel Gulliver, whose travels
among the Houyhnhnms, rather more than a century ago, may have
been heard of by a few of our antiquarian and classical readers.
To that work we would refer, to show that Houyhnhnm is "the perfection
of nature;" which truth will partly account for the following melancholy
narrative. "I admired" (the author writes) "the strength,
comeliness, and speed of the inhabitants; and such a constellation of
virtues in such amiable persons, produced in me the highest veneration."</p>

<p class="indent">Having the view of horse-flesh which this preface opens,
though we have not had an opportunity of studying it so purely under our mixed
government, breeds, and circumstances, it is unnecessary to explain
the panic which arose on the announcement of so universal a system of
railways to supersede the noble animal in every beneficial and elegant
office, and reduce it to the condition of a useless sinecurist, even if
permitted to live on human bounty. The result was that, when the
severities of winter fell thick and fast, a convocation was held by
moonlight in Smithfield, and adjourned, owing to the multitude, to
Horselydown, (so called from King John being tumbled off his nag
by that process in that locality,) and, after a most interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
discussion, it was unanimously resolved that every horse in Great
Britain should die. Wherefore should they live? Steam-boats had thrown
the wayfaring trackers out of hay; steam-ploughs, the agricultural
labourers out of oats; steam-carriages, the best of posters out of
employment; steam guns, the military out of service; steam-engines,
the mechanics out of mills and factories;&mdash;in short, their occupations
were gone, and they knew not where they could get a bit to their
mouths. Wherefore should they live!</p>

<p class="indent">The resolution having been communicated throughout the
country, and an hour appointed for the catastrophe, though it had nigh broken
the hearts of some petted ponies and favourites, it was obeyed with
all the stubborn <i>sted</i>-fastness of this illustrious creature. Racers
and hunters, coach and cart, high-bred and low, drays and galloways, saddle
and side ditto, Suffolk punches and dogsmeat, cobs and cabs, hacks
and shelties, respectables and rips, old and young, stallions, mares,
geldings, colts, foals, and fillies,&mdash;all perished at the same time.
O'Connell's tail was the only one that remained extant in England,
Wales, Scotland, and Ireland; but this our tale hath no reference to
that. It may be inquired by the physiologist what were the means of
death to which the abhorrence of steam induced the horses to resort;
and it is gratifying to be able to satisfy their thirst for knowledge by
stating that they died of the <i>Vapours</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">But we now come to the extraordinary results which must
spring from the fatal fact we have just recorded. "<i>What next?</i>" as the
political pamphleteer sayeth:&mdash;ay, <i>what next</i>? How will the
country go on? <i>What will the Lords do</i>&mdash;without horses?</p>

<p class="indent">The revolution produced by the event was immediately felt
in every part of the empire, in every pursuit, in every trade, in every
amusement. Within four-and-twenty hours, the isle was frighted
from her propriety, and England could no longer be recognised for
herself. It is true that the crown remained; but how shorn of its
beams! And then the whole <i>Equestrian</i> order had been destroyed at
a blow. Talk of swamping the Peers! it was done, and they could
dragoon the representatives of the people no more. And in proportion
to their fall was the rise of the <i>Commoners</i>. Not a donkey-man
whose ass fed on these wastes, but found himself in a higher and more
powerful position. When horses are out of the field, great is the
increase of the value of asses. The brutes, it is true, are still
long-eared, obstinate, devoid of speed, rat-tailed, and stupid; but, in
the absence of nobler beasts, whatever is, must be first. And so it now
happened. The huckster, the gipsy, the higgler, the donkey-driver
of Margate, the costermonger, the sandman, every asinine possessor
mounted in the scale, as it fell out, with a one or more ass power, and
the scum became the top of the boiling-pot of society, who all at once
found themselves gentlemen of property and influence. Little had
the superior classes dreamed how entirely their dignity and consequence
depended on their "cattle;" but now, when a Wellington, a
Grey, a Melbourne, an Anglesey, a Jersey, a Cavendish, a Fane, a
Somerset, had to trudge on foot through the muddy streets, whilst
the Scrogginses, the Smiths, the Gileses, the Toms, Bills, and Charleys
honoured them with a nod and a splash as they scampered by,
shouting "Go it, Neddy!" it was sadly demonstrated to them, and to
the world, that their former personal vanity, pride, and presumption
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
had been built on a false foundation; for it was not themselves, but
their fine and noble horses, that had won the observance and
submissiveness of their fellow men unmounted.</p>

<p class="indent">The instant effects of the hippo-hecatomb in every circle
and business of life were as remarkable as they were important. No previous
imagination could have suggested a hom&oelig;opathic part of the vast
change. His Majesty had decided to open parliament, not by
proxy, but in person,&mdash;that is to say, he was to proceed to the House
in royal state, and read his speech as if it were his own, instead of
leaving it to five gentlemen in large cloaks, as if it were theirs, and
be ashamed to march through Coventry with them; but, alas the day!
the cream-coloured steeds were all dead, and the blacks were as pale
as the cream. Windsor awoke in affright and dismay. There were the
royal carriages, and there the coachmen, and there the grooms, and
there the hussars; but where were the horses? Gone! It was a moment
for an ebullition of loyalty, and we record it as an everlasting
honour to their young patriotic feelings, that the boys at Eton, in this
mighty emergency, respectfully offered their services to drag the
King to London, providing the head-master sat upon the box as driver,
and the ushers clustered behind, in the character of the footmen. A
council held on the proposition decided that the task would be too
much for the tender years of the Etonians, and especially as drawing
had hardly been taught in that classic establishment; so that, instead
of being competent to draw a monarch, there was not a boy in the
school who could draw anything. At Woolwich it was quite the reverse.
In the increasing dilemma,&mdash;for his Majesty declined the walk,
and the route by the river could not be performed in time,&mdash;it was
resolved to despatch one of the royal messengers on the swiftest ass
which the town could produce, and order a short prorogation till measures
could be adopted to meet the awful exigences of the crisis.</p>

<p class="indent">In London, meanwhile, the consternation was equally overwhelming,
if not more so. Ministers met in cabinet, but, as usual, knew not
what to do; and so agreed to lie by, a bit, and see how matters might
shape their own course. The First Lord of the Treasury and three
secretaries sat down to a rubber of long whist, half-crown points; the
Lord President of the Council, First Lord of the Admiralty, President
of the Board of Control, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and
Lord Privy Seal, preferred three-card loo; and the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade had a capital
<i>tête-à-tête</i> bout at brag. The other officers of state employed themselves
as they could, from the Lord High Chancellor to the store-keepers
and under-secretaries. And meanwhile the public mind, that is to
say, all the mind inside the hats of the mob about Whitehall and
Westminster, was in a tumult of excitement. Two o'clock struck, and
no guns were heard: three, and the patereros were dumb. The clock
of the Horse Guards&mdash;the Horse Guards! a name of departed glory
and present woe!&mdash;told the hour in vain; till, just as it gave warning
for four, a breathless and panting ass was seen galloping into Downing
street. It bore the express from Windsor, who by prodigious exertions
had accomplished the journey in less than seven hours. The unfinished
rubber was broken up, to the heavy mortification of the First
Lord, who scored eight, and was looking forward to a call of the honours;
the loo-scores were balanced and settled, the First Lord of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
the Admiralty pocketing the profits, in consequence of taking one for
his heels as the donkey turned up; and "I brag" fell no more from
Exchequer or Trade. But it was already too late to restore order; and
confusion in the midst of deliberation only became worse confounded.
Extraneous calamities every instant interfered. No mails had arrived,
and very few peeresses. The letters containing friendly assurances
from foreign governments were in post-offices, Heaven knew at what
distances. Such of the ministers, bachelor as well as married, as were
directed by their grey mares, had no opportunity for consulting and
receiving their commands, though it must have been in some degree
a consolation to feel that they remained amid the wreck of horse-flesh.
In short, in politics, as at cards, the game was up. The English
constitution was not the constitution of a horse, and it gave way
before the frightful revolution; and, to add to the individual horrors
of the scene, the Master of the Buckhounds, the Master of the Horse,
the Postmaster-General, and the Master of the Rolls (why <i>he</i>, could
never be conjectured) committed suicide in the course of the ensuing
night; and the Lord Chancellor became a confirmed lunatic, under
his own care.</p>

<p class="indent">It were tedious to trace all the varieties of aspects into
which this awful event plunged the nation: a few, briefly described, may suffice
to indicate its universal extent and terrible alterations. Routs, ball,
at homes, operas, and every fashionable amusement and resort were
abrogated. The ladies of the land were bowed to the ground. Visits
could not be paid: to dress was unnecessary. There was no crush-room;
and milliners, mantua-makers, perfumers, and jewellers were
crushed. Seventeen old sedan-chairs were the total that could be
discovered in London; and these, with the succedaneum suggested
by the witty Countess of &mdash;&mdash;, viz. mounting such of the porters'
hall-chairs as were susceptible of the improvement upon poles, in a
similar manner, constituted the whole migrations of the fashionable
world. We will not allude to the meetings baulked, and the assignations
broken, through this unfortunate state of things; and are only
sorry to say it did not add to the sum of domestic felicity.</p>

<p class="indent">The Park&mdash;dismal was the Park! Exquisites, more helpless
than ever, tottered along its almost deserted walks. There was not one who,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;With left heel insidiously aside,</span>
<span class="i0">Provoked the caper he would seem to chide;</span>
</div></div>

<p>nor was there a pretty woman to smile at him if he had. Could the
race have obtained asses, it would have been most unnatural to ride
them; and thus they vanished from the vision of society.</p>

<p class="indent">Ascot was not particularly unhappy, though the King's
cup was a cup of dregs. But Bentinck and Crocky, Richmond and Gully,
Exeter and Lamb, Rutland and &mdash;&mdash;, Jersey and &mdash;&mdash;, Chesterfield
and the rest of the legs, got up an excellent two days' sport. Running
in sacks afforded ample opportunities for betting heavily; and
wheelbarrow races, with the barrow-drivers blindfolded or partially
enlightened, were found quite as good as anything which had been
done before, and allowing quite as much scope for the honourable
strategies of the turf. An immense number of useless horsecollars
were brought to be grinned through; and the books of literature and
intelligence surpassed, if anything, those of other times.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">At Epsom, the old and general patrons of that course having
now the ascendency, indulged in donkey races, at which the poor nobility
gazed with speechless regret. The last were truly the first, here.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the instances of individual ruin, none was more
unentertaining than that of Mr. Ducrow. Reduced to a single zebra, he was
obliged to turn wanderer and mendicant; the stripes of Misfortune
were vividly impressed upon him. Circuses and amphitheatres
ceased; and the dragon was more than a match for the poor horseless
St. George. What a symbol of the decline of England, when even
her patron saint must yield to a Saurian reptile!</p>

<p class="indent">Of all human beings affected by the calamity, deep as were
the afflictions of others, perhaps those who evinced the most sensitive
and overpowering feelings on the occasion, were the butchers' boys.
As a class, they evidently suffered beyond the rest. Betrayed,
unsupported, and wretched, they trudged under the heavy burthens of
fate, as if the world&mdash;as indeed in one sense it was&mdash;were out
of joint for them. The centaurs of antiquity were destroyed by a demigod;
but the modern centaurs had nothing to soothe their pride. They
were hurled down, but living and without a hope. Poor lads! every
heart bled for them.</p>

<p class="indent">There were another set of men, almost equally unfortunate,
though they endured it with greater equanimity,&mdash;the late royal
horseguards, with all their splendid caparisons, their tags and tassels,
their sashes and sabres, their spurs and epaulettes, their helms and
feathers; the officers, people of the first families in the country, the
men, the picked and chosen of the plebeian many. The high <i>élite</i> and
the low, reduced alike by unsparing destiny to foot it with the
humblest,&mdash;it was a grievous blow; and, considering their Uniform
conduct, most undeserved. And it was accordingly felt that among the
earliest evils for which a remedy should be sought, was the remounting
of those so essential to the dignity of the throne and the safety
of the realm. True it was, that of the animals they once bestrode
not a skin was left; but donkeys were to be procured at excessive
prices; and they were obtained for this especial purpose. As yet,
the man&oelig;uvres of the Royal Ass Guards are more amusing than
seemly; but there is no doubt that with time and discipline they will
be, as before, the foremost corps in the service.</p>

<p class="indent">It were easy to enlarge upon similar topics to the end of
this tome, but they would only serve to illustrate that which, we trust, we
have illustrated enough. At Melton it was melancholy to see the gay
hunter, unable to risk his limbs and neck, reduced to stalking,&mdash;and
stalking, too, without a horse. Carts being <i>hors de combat</i>, the truck
system began to prevail in all quarters, and, bad as it was, what
could not be cured must be endured. Londonderry went into mourning
on account of having exported seventy asses to Canada by a
vessel which sailed about a month before, about the same period that
the old bear at the Tower was sent to America, together with the
monkey which bit Ensign Seymour's leg. Scotland suffered in the
extreme, in spite of its excellent banking business and assets, for
there was scarcely an ass in the country, except among some gipsies
at Yetholm (vide Guy Mannering); and if, as we are certain it is
not, one in a thousand of our readers ever saw a dead jackass anywhere,
it will be agreed that not one in a million could ever enjoy
that spectacle on the north side of Tweed. But enough: the kingdom
was turned upside down,&mdash;old gentlemen without their hobbies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
young gentlemen without their exhibitions, sportsmen without their
sports, schoolboys in the holidays without their ponies, ladies without
their rides and knights,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
coachmen without their hacks, waggoners without their teams, barges without
their draughts, the army without cavalry, and a king and aristocracy without
equipages,&mdash;the revolution is complete.</p>

<p class="indent">In picturing this appalling change, it is but proper to notice
that the agricultural interests have not been so severely dealt with. The
substitution of bullocks was effected without much difficulty in most
farms; and in others hand labour was happily introduced, which employed
the poor, and, upon the whole, rather ameliorated the condition
of the people.</p>

<p class="indent">At first, and for a while, it appeared as if dogs, as well
as asses, would rise in value; but it was soon discovered that every dog would
have only a short day. Like honest creatures as they are, they
pulled and tugged at the cruel loads imposed upon them, till gradually
their strength departed from them, and they died away. Their
supply of food had failed, and the last of the knackers had followed
the last of the tails. Pigs were tried, but positively refused to train.
They smelt the wind, or what was in it; and, when out of breath,
had no idea of getting a new one. A few goats in babies' shays were
honoured as well-bearded and respectable-looking substitutes for the
departed; and the Principality published several triads on the auspicious
circumstance.</p>

<p class="indent">But there was a curious coincidence in London, which puzzled
the British Association, the Royal Society, and other learned bodies, and
which it is probable never can be satisfactorily accounted for. We
refer to the sudden and enormous rise in the price of German, Strasburg,
and Bologna sausages. Epping, like Epsom, might be involved
in the national difficulty; but how distant countries, Germany and
Italy, could by possibility be affected, was a mystery which the
Geographical, and even the Statistical Society, professed themselves
incompetent to determine.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">From bad to worse has been the rapid declension of
the empire since the fatal day of the fatal catastrophe which is the subject of
this pitiable historical record. Competition, too faint for success,
having ceased, steam and smoke have everywhere usurped the once
blooming soil. From them, we are now a land of clouds,&mdash;murky
clouds, to which those of Aristophanes are but fanciful and brilliant
exhalations. Intersected by railroads, the iron age is restored, and
the golden has vanished for ever. The commonweal revolves on the
axes of tramwheels and trains; the reins of government are utterly
relaxed; and the country, saddled with taxes and burthens, can no
longer afford its inhabitants a single morsel. Engineers and speculators
are bringing us to a dead level everywhere; and a republic
is the inevitable consequence. For our parts, with the stomach of a
horse, and loving beyond measure a sound horse-laugh, emigration
is our immediate purpose. By Strasburg and Bologna will we wend
our way, and endeavour to fathom the sausage-wonder; and thence, if
no better may be, we shall sail for the Houyhnhnms' Land, (to the
south of Lewin's and Nuyt's Land, and the west of Maelsuyker's Isle),
and, at all events, make our finale like Trojans, by trusting to the horse!

<h2>OLIVER TWIST,</h2>
<p class="f110">OR, <b>THE PARISH BOY'S PROGRESS.</b></p>
<p class="f90">BY BOZ.<br />ILLUSTRATED BY GEORGE CRUIKSHANK.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<h3>CHAPTER THE FIFTH.</h3>
<p class="f110 space-below1">OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES, AND,<br />GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR
THE FIRST TIME, FORMS<br />AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER'S BUSINESS.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker's shop,
set the lamp down on a workman's bench, and gazed timidly about him
with a feeling of awe and dread, which many people a good deal
older than Oliver will be at no loss to understand. An unfinished
coffin on black tressels, which stood in the middle of the
shop, looked so gloomy and death-like, that a cold tremble came
over him every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the
dismal object, from which he almost expected to see some frightful
form slowly rear its head to drive him mad with terror.
Against the wall were ranged in regular array a long row of
elm boards cut into the same shape, and looking in the dim light
like high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches
pockets. Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and
shreds of black cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall
above the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of
two mutes in very stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large private door,
with a hearse drawn by four black steeds approaching in the
distance. The shop was close and hot, and the atmosphere
seemed tainted with the smell of coffins. The recess beneath the
counter in which his flock-mattress was thrust, looked like a grave.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed
Oliver. He was alone in a strange place; and we all know how
chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel
in such a situation. The boy had no friends to care for, or to care for
him. The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind;
the absence of no loved and well-remembered face sunk heavily
into his heart. But his heart <i>was</i> heavy, notwithstanding; and
he wished, as he crept into his narrow bed, that that were his
coffin, and that he could be laid in a calm and lasting sleep in
the churchyard ground, with the tall grass waving gently above
his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Oliver was awakened in the morning by a loud kicking
at the outside of the shop-door, which, before he could huddle on his
clothes, was repeated in an angry and impetuous manner about
twenty-five times; and, when he began to undo the chain, the
legs left off their volleys, and a voice began.</p>

</div>
<p class="f120 space-below1"><b>Oliver plucks up a spirit.</b></p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p class="indent">"Open the door, will yer?" cried the voice which belonged to
the legs which had kicked at the door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"I will directly, sir," replied Oliver, undoing the chain,
and turning the key.</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose yer the new boy, a'nt yer?" said the voice,
through the key-hole.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir," replied Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">"How old are yer?" inquired the voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Eleven, sir," replied Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I'll whop yer when I get in," said the voice;
"you just see if I don't, that's all, my work'us brat!" and, having
made this obliging promise, the voice began to whistle.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to
which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference,
to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever
he might be, would redeem his pledge most honourably.
He drew back the bolts with a trembling hand, and opened the door.</p>

<p class="indent">For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and
down the street, and over the way, impressed with the belief that the
unknown, who had addressed him through the key-hole, had
walked a few paces off to warm himself, for nobody did Oliver
see but a big charity-boy sitting on the post in front of the
house, eating a slice of bread and butter, which he cut into
wedges the size of his mouth with a clasp-knife, and then consumed
with great dexterity.</p>

<p class="indent">"I beg your pardon, sir," said Oliver, at length,
seeing that no other visitor made his appearance; "did you knock?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I kicked," replied the charity-boy.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you want a coffin, sir?" inquired Oliver, innocently.</p>

<p class="indent">At this the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce, and
said that Oliver would stand in need of one before long, if he cut jokes
with his superiors in that way.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yer don't know who I am, I suppose, work'us?" said
the charity-boy, in continuation; descending from the top of the
post, meanwhile, with edifying gravity.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, sir," rejoined Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm Mister Noah Claypole," said the charity-boy,
"and you're under me. Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!"
With this Mr. Claypole administered a kick to Oliver,
and entered the shop with a dignified air, which did him great
credit: it is difficult for a large-headed, small-eyed youth, of
lumbering make and heavy countenance, to look dignified under
any circumstances; but it is more especially so, when, superadded
to these personal attractions, are a red nose and yellow smalls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Oliver having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane
of glass in his efforts to stagger away beneath the weight of the first
one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were
kept during the day, was graciously assisted by Noah, who,
having consoled him with the assurance that "he'd catch it,"
condescended to help him. Mr. Sowerberry came down soon
after, and, shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry appeared; and
Oliver having "caught it," in fulfilment of Noah's prediction,
followed that young gentleman down stairs to breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come near the fire, Noah," said Charlotte. "I saved a
nice little piece of bacon for you from master's breakfast. Oliver, shut
that door at Mister Noah's back, and take them bits that I've
put out on the cover of the bread-pan. There's your tea; take
it away to that box, and drink it there, and make haste, for
they'll want you to mind the shop. D'ye hear?"</p>

<p class="indent">"D'ye hear, work'us?" said Noah Claypole.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lor, Noah!" said Charlotte, "what a rum creature
you are! Why don't you let the boy alone?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Let him alone!" said Noah. "Why everybody lets
him alone enough, for the matter of that. Neither his father nor
mother will ever interfere with him: all his relations let him
have his own way pretty well. Eh, Charlotte? He! he! he!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you queer soul!" said Charlotte, bursting into
a hearty laugh, in which she was joined by Noah; after which they both
looked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering
upon the box in the coldest corner of the room, and ate the
stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him.</p>

<p class="indent">Noah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan.
No chance-child was he, for he could trace his genealogy back all
the way to his parents, who lived hard by; his mother being a
washerwoman, and his father a drunken soldier, discharged
with a wooden leg and a diurnal pension of twopence-halfpenny
and an unstateable fraction. The shop-boys in the neighbourhood
had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public
streets with ignominious epithets of "leathers," "charity,"
and the like; and Noah had borne them without reply. But
now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at
whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted
on him with interest. This affords charming food for
contemplation. It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature
is, and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed
in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity-boy.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker's
some three weeks or a month, and Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry, the shop
being shut up, were taking their supper in the little back-parlour,
when Mr. Sowerberry, after several deferential glances at his wife, said,</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear&mdash;" He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry
looking up with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Well!" said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing, my dear, nothing," said Mr. Sowerberry.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ugh, you brute!" said Mrs. Sowerberry.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not at all, my dear," said Mr. Sowerberry, humbly. "I
thought you didn't want to hear, my dear. I was only going to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, don't tell me what you were going to say," interposed
Mrs. Sowerberry. "I am nobody; don't consult me, pray. <i>I</i>
don't want to intrude upon your secrets." And, as Mrs. Sowerberry
said this, she gave an hysterical laugh, which threatened
violent consequences.</p>

<p class="indent">"But, my dear," said Sowerberry, "I want to ask your advice."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no, don't ask mine," replied Mrs. Sowerberry,
in an affecting manner; "ask somebody else's." Here there was another
hysterical laugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very
much. This is a very common and much-approved matrimonial
course of treatment, which is often very effective. It at once
reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging as a special favour to be
allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to hear,
and, after a short altercation of less than three quarters of an
hour's duration, the permission was most graciously conceded.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's only about young Twist, my dear," said
Mr. Sowerberry. "A very good-looking boy that, my dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"He need be, for he eats enough," observed the lady.</p>

<p class="indent">"There's an expression of melancholy in his face,
my dear," resumed Mr. Sowerberry, "which is very interesting. He would
make a delightful mute, my dear."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of
considerable wonderment. Mr. Sowerberry remarked it, and, without allowing
time for any observation on the good lady's part, proceeded,</p>

<p class="indent">"I don't mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people,
my dear, but only for children's practice. It would be very new to
have a mute in proportion, my dear. You may depend upon it
that it would have a superb effect."</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in
the undertaking way, was much struck by the novelty of the idea; but,
as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so
under existing circumstances, she merely inquired with much
sharpness why such an obvious suggestion had not presented
itself to her husband's mind before. Mr. Sowerberry rightly
construed this as an acquiescence in his proposition: it was
speedily determined that Oliver should be at once initiated into
the mysteries of the profession, and, with this view, that he
should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his
services being required.</p>

<p class="indent">The occasion was not long in coming; for, half an
hour after breakfast next morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop, and
supporting his cane against the counter, drew forth his large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
leathern pocket-book, from which he selected a small scrap of
paper which he handed over to Sowerberry.</p>

<p class="indent">"Aha!" said the undertaker, glancing over it with
a lively countenance; "an order for a coffin, eh?"</p>

<p class="indent">"For a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,"
replied Mr. Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book,
which, like himself, was very corpulent.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bayton," said the undertaker, looking from the scrap
of paper to Mr. Bumble; "I never heard the name before."</p>

<p class="indent">Bumble shook his head as he replied, "Obstinate people,
Mr. Sowerberry, very obstinate; proud, too, I'm afraid, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Proud, eh?" exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer.&mdash;"Come,
that's too much."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, it's sickening," replied the beadle;
"perfectly antimonial, Mr. Sowerberry."</p>

<p class="indent">"So it is," acquiesced the undertaker.</p>

<p class="indent">"We only heard of them the night before last,"
said the beadle; "and we shouldn't have known anything about them
then, only a woman who lodges in the same house made an
application to the porochial committee for them to send the
porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad. He had
gone out to dinner; but his 'prentice, which is a very clever
lad, sent 'em some medicine in a blacking-bottle, off-hand."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, there's promptness," said the undertaker.</p>

<p class="indent">"Promptness, indeed!" replied the beadle. "But what's
the consequence; what's the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels,
sir? Why, the husband sends back word that the medicine
won't suit his wife's complaint, and so she shan't take it&mdash;says she
shan't take it, sir. Good, strong, wholesome medicine, as was given
with great success to two Irish labourers and a coalheaver only
a week before&mdash;sent 'em for nothing, with a blacking-bottle
in,&mdash;and he sends back word that she shan't take it, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">As the flagrant atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble's
mind in full force, he struck the counter sharply with his cane,
and became flushed with indignation.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," said the undertaker,
"I ne&mdash;ver&mdash;did&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Never did, sir!" ejaculated the beadle,&mdash;"no,
nor nobody never did; but, now she's dead, we've got to bury her, and
that's the direction, and the sooner it's done, the better."</p>

<p class="indent">Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked-hat wrong side
first, in a fever of parochial excitement, and flounced out of the shop.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even
to ask after you," said Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he
strode down the street.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir," replied Oliver, who had carefully kept
himself out of sight during the interview, and who was shaking from
head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble's
voice. He needn't have taken the trouble to shrink from Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Bumble's glance, however; for that functionary on whom the
prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a
very strong impression, thought that now the undertaker had
got Oliver upon trial, the subject was better avoided, until such
time as he should be firmly bound for seven years, and all
danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish
should be thus effectually and legally overcome.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, "the
sooner this job is done, the better. Noah, look after the shop. Oliver,
put on your cap, and come with me." Oliver obeyed; and followed
his master on his professional mission.</p>

<p class="indent">They walked on for some time through the most crowded
and densely inhabited part of the town, and then striking down a
narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet
passed through, paused to look for the house which was the
object of their search. The houses on either side were high and
large, but very old; and tenanted by people of the poorest class,
as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted
without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks
of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies
half doubled, occasionally skulked like shadows along. A great
many of the tenements had shop-fronts; but they were fast
closed, and mouldering away: only the upper rooms being inhabited.
Others, which had become insecure from age and decay,
were prevented from falling into the street by huge beams of
wood which were reared against the tottering walls, and firmly
planted in the road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have
been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches,
for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door
and window, were wrenched from their positions to afford an
aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body. The
kennel was stagnant and filthy; the very rats that here and
there lay putrefying in its rottenness, were hideous with famine.</p>

<p class="indent">There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open
door where Oliver and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously
through the dark passage, and bidding Oliver keep close
to him and not be afraid, the undertaker mounted to the top of
the first flight of stairs, and, stumbling against a door on the
landing, rapped at it with his knuckles.</p>

<p class="indent">It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen.
The undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained, to
know it was the apartment to which he had been directed. He
stepped in, and Oliver followed him.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no fire in the room; but a man was
crouching mechanically over the empty stove. An old woman, too, had
drawn a low stool to the cold hearth, and was sitting beside him.
There were some ragged children in another corner; and in a
small recess opposite the door there lay upon the ground something
covered with an old blanket. Oliver shuddered as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
cast his eyes towards the place, and crept involuntarily closer to
his master; for, though it was covered up, the boy <i>felt</i> that it
was a corpse.</p>

<p class="indent">The man's face was thin and very pale; his hair
and beard were grizzly, and his eyes were blood-shot. The old woman's
face was wrinkled, her two remaining teeth protruded over her
under lip, and her eyes were bright and piercing. Oliver
was afraid to look at either her or the man,&mdash;they seemed
so like the rats he had seen outside.</p>

<p class="indent">"Nobody shall go near her," said the man, starting
fiercely up, as the undertaker approached the recess. "Keep back!
d&mdash;n you, keep back, if you've a life to lose."</p>

<p class="indent">"Nonsense! my good man," said the undertaker, who was
pretty well used to misery in all its shapes,&mdash;"nonsense!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I tell you," said the man, clenching his hands, and
stamping furiously on the floor,&mdash;"I tell you I won't have her put
into the ground. She couldn't rest there. The worms would
worry&mdash;not eat her,&mdash;she is so worn away."</p>

<p class="indent">The undertaker offered no reply to this raving, but producing
a tape from his pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah!" said the man, bursting into tears, and sinking on
his knees at the feet of the dead woman; "kneel down, kneel down&mdash;kneel
round her every one of you, and mark my words. I
say she starved to death. I never knew how bad she was, till
the fever came upon her, and then her bones were starting
through the skin. There was neither fire nor candle; she died
in the dark&mdash;in the dark. She couldn't even see her children's
faces, though we heard her gasping out their names. I begged
for her in the streets, and they sent me to prison. When I
came back, she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has
dried up, for they starved her to death. I swear it before the
God that saw it,&mdash;they starved her!"&mdash;He twined his hands in
his hair, and with a loud scream rolled grovelling upon the floor,
his eyes fixed, and the foam gushing from his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">The terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman,
who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to
all that passed, menaced them into silence; and having unloosened
the man's cravat, who still remained extended on the
ground, tottered towards the undertaker.</p>

<p class="indent">"She was my daughter," said the old woman, nodding her
head in the direction of the corpse, and speaking with an idiotic
leer, more ghastly than even the presence of death itself.&mdash;"Lord,
Lord!&mdash;well, it is strange that I who gave birth to her,
and was a woman then, should be alive and merry now, and she
lying there, so cold and stiff! Lord, Lord!&mdash;to think of it;&mdash;it's
as good as a play&mdash;as good as a play!"</p>

<p class="indent">As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her
hideous merriment, the undertaker turned to go away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Stop, stop!" said the old woman in a loud whisper. "Will
she be buried to-morrow&mdash;or next day&mdash;or to-night? I laid
her out, and I must walk, you know. Send me a large cloak&mdash;a
good warm one, for it is bitter cold. We should have cake and
wine, too, before we go! Never mind: send some bread&mdash;only
a loaf of bread and a cup of water. Shall we have some bread,
dear?" she said eagerly, catching at the undertaker's coat, as he
once more moved towards the door.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, yes," said the undertaker, "of course;
anything, everything." He disengaged himself from the old woman's
grasp, and, dragging Oliver after him, hurried away.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved
with a half-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them
by Mr. Bumble himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the
miserable abode, where Mr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied
by four men from the workhouse, who were to act as
bearers. An old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of
the old woman and the man; the bare coffin having been
screwed down, was then hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers,
and carried down stairs into the street.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady,"
whispered Sowerberry in the old woman's ear; "we are rather late,
and it won't do to keep the clergyman waiting. Move on, my
men,&mdash;as quick as you like."</p>

<p class="indent">Thus directed, the bearers trotted on, under their
light burden, and the two mourners kept as near them as they could.
Mr. Bumble and Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in
front; and Oliver, whose legs were not as long as his master's,
ran by the side.</p>

<p class="indent">There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as
Mr. Sowerberry had anticipated, however; for when they reached the
obscure corner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew, and
the parish graves were made, the clergyman had not arrived,
and the clerk, who was sitting by the vestry-room fire, seemed
to think it by no means improbable that it might be an hour or
so before he came. So they set the bier down on the brink of
the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp
clay with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys,
whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard, played a
noisy game at hide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied
their amusements jumping backwards and forwards over the
coffin. Mr. Sowerberry and Bumble, being personal friends of
the clerk, sat by the fire with him, and read the paper.</p>

<p class="indent">At length, after the lapse of something more than
an hour, Mr. Bumble, and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen
running towards the grave; and immediately afterwards the
clergyman appeared, putting on his surplice as he came along.
Mr Bumble then threshed a boy or two, to keep up appearances;
and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
burial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his
surplice to the clerk, and ran away again.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, Bill," said Sowerberry to the grave-digger, "fill up."</p>

<p class="indent">It was no very difficult task, for the grave was so
full that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface. The
grave-digger shovelled in the earth, stamped it loosely down
with his feet, shouldered his spade, and walked off, followed by
the boys, who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, my good fellow," said Bumble, tapping the man on
the back, "they want to shut up the yard."</p>

<p class="indent">The man, who had never once moved since he had taken
his station by the grave side, started, raised his head, stared at the
person who had addressed him, walked forward for a few paces,
and then fell down in a fit. The crazy old woman was too much
occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak (which the undertaker
had taken off) to pay him any attention; so they threw a
can of cold water over him, and when he came to, saw him
safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed on
their different ways.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, Oliver," said Sowerberry, as they walked
home, "how do you like it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Pretty well, thank you, sir," replied Oliver,
with considerable hesitation. "Not very much, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, you'll get used to it in time, Oliver," said
Sowerberry. "Nothing when you <i>are</i> used to it, my boy."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Oliver wondered in his own mind whether it had
taken a very long time to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it; but he thought it
better not to ask the question, and walked back to the shop,
thinking over all he had seen and heard.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THE SIXTH.</h3>
<p class="f110">OLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH,<br />
ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND RATHER ASTONISHES HIM.</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">It was a nice sickly season just at this time.
In commercial phrase, coffins were looking up; and, in the course of a few
weeks, Oliver had acquired a great deal of experience. The
success of Mr. Sowerberry's ingenious speculation exceeded even
his most sanguine hopes. The oldest inhabitants recollected no
period at which measles had been so prevalent, or so fatal to infant
existence; and many were the mournful processions which
little Oliver headed in a hat-band reaching down to his knees, to
the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in
the town. As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his
adult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity
of demeanour and full command of nerve which are so
essential to a finished undertaker, he had many opportunities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which
some strong-minded people bear their trial and losses.</p>

<p class="indent">For instance, when Sowerberry had an order for the
burial of some rich old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great
number of nephews and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable
during the previous illness, and whose grief had been
wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions, they
would be as happy among themselves as need be&mdash;quite cheerful
and contented, conversing together with as much freedom and
gaiety as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them.
Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic
calmness; and wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as
if, so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up
their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible.
It was observable, too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in
passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment, recovered
almost as soon as they reached home, and became quite composed
before the tea-drinking was over. All this was very pleasant
and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the
example of these good people, I cannot, although I am his biographer,
undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence; but I can
most distinctly say, that for some weeks he continued meekly to
submit to the domination and ill-treatment of Noah Claypole,
who used him far worse than ever, now that his jealousy was
roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and
hat-band, while he, the old one, remained stationary in the muffin-cap
and leathers. Charlotte treated him badly because Noah
did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy because Mr.
Sowerberry was disposed to be his friend: so, between these
three on one side, and a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was
not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he
was shut up by mistake in the grain department of a brewery.</p>

<p class="indent">And now I come to a very important passage in Oliver's
history, for I have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps
in appearance, but which indirectly produced a most material
change in all his future prospects and proceedings.</p>

<p class="indent">One day Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen,
at the usual dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton&mdash;a
pound and a half of the worst end of the neck; when, Charlotte
being called out of the way, there ensued a brief interval
of time, which Noah Claypole, being hungry and vicious, considered
he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than
aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.</p>

<p class="indent">Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet
on the table-cloth, and pulled Oliver's hair, and twitched his ears,
and expressed his opinion that he was a "sneak," and furthermore
announced his intention of coming to see him hung whenever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
that desirable event should take place, and entered upon
various other topics of petty annoyance, like a malicious and
ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was. But, none of these taunts
producing the desired effect of making Oliver cry, Noah attempted
to be more facetious still, and in this attempt did what
many small wits, with far greater reputations than Noah notwithstanding,
do to this day when they want to be funny;&mdash;he
got rather personal.</p>

<p class="indent">"Work'us," said Noah, "how's your mother?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She's dead," replied Oliver; "don't you say anything
about her to me!"</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver's colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly,
and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr.
Claypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent
fit of crying. Under this impression he returned to the charge.</p>

<p class="indent">"What did she die of, work'us?" said Noah.</p>

<p class="indent">"Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,"
replied Oliver, more as if he were talking to himself than answering
Noah. "I think I know what it must be to die of that!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, work'us," said Noah,
as a tear rolled down Oliver's cheek. "What's set you a snivelling now?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not <i>you</i>," replied Oliver, hastily brushing
the tear away. "Don't think it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, not me, eh?" sneered Noah.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, not you," replied Oliver, sharply. "There; that's
enough. Don't say anything more to me about her; you'd better not!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Better not!" exclaimed Noah. "Well! better not! work'us;
don't be impudent. <i>Your</i> mother, too! She was a nice
'un, she was. Oh, Lor!" And here Noah nodded his head expressively,
and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular
action could collect together for the occasion.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yer know, work'us," continued Noah, emboldened by
Oliver's silence, and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity&mdash;of
all tones the most annoying&mdash;"Yer know, work'us, it carn't be
helped now, and of course yer couldn't help it then, and I'm
very sorry for it, and I'm sure we all are, and pity yer very
much. But yer must know, work'us, your mother was a regular
right-down bad 'un."</p>

<p class="indent">"What did you say?" inquired Oliver,
looking up very quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">"A regular right-down bad 'un, work'us," replied
Noah, coolly; "and it's a great deal better, work'us, that she died
when she did, or else she'd have been hard labouring in
Bridewell, or transported, or hung, which is more likely than
either, isn't it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Crimson with fury, Oliver started up, overthrew chair
and table, seized Noah by the throat, shook him in the violence of
his rage till his teeth chattered in his head, and, collecting his
whole force into one heavy blow, felled him to the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">A minute ago the boy had looked the quiet, mild,
dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him. But his spirit
was roused at last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had
set his blood on fire. His breast heaved, his attitude was
erect, his eye bright and vivid, and his whole person changed, as
he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor that lay crouching
at his feet, and defied him with an energy he had never known before.</p>

<p class="indent">"He'll murder me!" blubbered Noah. "Charlotte!
missis! here's the new boy a-murdering me! Help! help! Oliver's
gone mad! Char&mdash;lotte!"</p>

<p class="indent">Noah's shouts were responded to, by a loud scream
from Charlotte, and a louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former
of whom rushed into the kitchen by a side-door, while the
latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that
it was consistent with the preservation of human life to come
further down.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you little wretch!" screamed Charlotte, seizing Oliver
with her utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately
strong man in particularly good training,&mdash;"Oh, you
little un-grate-ful, mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!" and between
every syllable Charlotte gave Oliver a blow with all her might,
and accompanied it with a scream for the benefit of society.</p>

<p class="indent">Charlotte's fist was by no means a light one; but, lest
it should not be effectual in calming Oliver's wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry
plunged into the kitchen, and assisted to hold him with
one hand, while she scratched his face with the other; and in
this favourable position of affairs Noah rose from the ground,
and pummeled him from behind.</p>

<p class="indent">This was rather too violent exercise to last long;
so, when they were all three wearied out, and could tear and beat no
longer, they dragged Oliver, struggling and shouting, but nothing
daunted, into the dust-cellar, and there locked him up;
and this being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a chair, and
burst into tears.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bless her, she's going off!" said Charlotte.
"A glass of water, Noah, dear. Make haste."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Charlotte," said Mrs. Sowerberry, speaking as well
as she could through a deficiency of breath and a sufficiency of cold
water, which Noah had poured over her head and shoulders,&mdash;"Oh,
Charlotte, what a mercy we have not been all murdered in our beds!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, mercy, indeed, ma'am," was the reply. "I only
hope this'll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful
creatures that are born to be murderers and robbers from their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
very cradle. Poor Noah! he was all but killed, ma'am, when I came in."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, poor fellow!" said Mrs. Sowerberry,
looking piteously on the charity-boy.</p>

<p class="indent">Noah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been
somewhere on a level with the crown of Oliver's head, rubbed his
eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was
bestowed upon him, and performed some very audible tears and sniffs.</p>

<p class="indent">"What's to be done!" exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. "Your
master's not at home&mdash;there's not a man in the house,&mdash;and he'll
kick that door down in ten minutes." Oliver's vigorous plunges
against the bit of timber in question rendered this occurrence
highly probable.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear, dear! I don't know, ma'am," said Charlotte,
"unless we send for the police-officers."</p>

<p class="indent">"Or the millingtary," suggested Mr. Claypole.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no," said Mrs. Sowerberry, bethinking herself
of Oliver's old friend; "run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to
come here directly, and not to lose a minute; never mind your
cap,&mdash;make haste. You can hold a knife to that black eye as
you run along, and it'll keep the swelling down."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Noah stopped to make no reply, but started
off at his fullest speed; and very much it astonished the people who were
out walking, to see a charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell,
with no cap on his head, and a clasp-knife at his eye.</p>

<h2>FAMILY STORIES.&mdash;No. III.</h2>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="f110"><b>GREY DOLPHIN</b>.</p>
<p class="f90">BY THOMAS INGOLDSBY, ESQ.</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">"He won't&mdash;won't he?
Then bring me my boots!" said the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">Consternation was at its height in the castle of Shurland&mdash;a caitiff
had dared to disobey the Baron! and&mdash;the Baron had called for his boots!</p>

<p class="indent">A thunderbolt in the great hall had been
a <i>bagatelle</i> to it.</p>

<p class="indent">A few days before, a notable miracle had been wrought in
the neighbourhood; and in those times miracles were not so common as
they are now:&mdash;no Royal Balloons, no steam, no railroads,&mdash;while the
few Saints who took the trouble to walk with their heads under their
arms, or pull the Devil by the nose, scarcely appeared above once in
a century:&mdash;so it made the greater sensation.</p>

<p class="indent">The clock had done striking twelve, and the Clerk of
Chatham was untrussing his points preparatory to seeking his truckle-bed:
a half-emptied tankard of mild ale stood at his elbow, the roasted crab
yet floating on its surface. Midnight had surprised the worthy functionary
while occupied in discussing it, and with the task yet unaccomplished.
He meditated a mighty draught: one hand was fumbling
with his tags, while the other was extended in the act of grasping
the jorum, when a knock on the portal, solemn and sonorous, arrested
his fingers. It was repeated thrice ere Emanuel Saddleton
had presence of mind sufficient to inquire who sought admittance at
that untimeous hour.</p>

<p class="indent">"Open! open! good Clerk of St. Bridget's," said a female voice,
small, yet distinct and sweet,&mdash;"an excellent thing in woman."</p>

<p class="indent">The clerk arose, crossed to the doorway, and undid the latchet.</p>

<p class="indent">On the threshold stood a lady of surpassing beauty: her
robes were rich, and large, and full; and a diadem, sparkling with gems that
shed a halo around, crowned her brow: she beckoned the clerk as he
stood in astonishment before her.</p>

<p class="indent">"Emanuel!" said the lady; and her tones sounded like those of
a silver flute. "Emanuel Saddleton, truss up your points, and follow me!"</p>

<p class="indent">The worthy clerk stared aghast at the vision; the purple robe,
the cymar, the coronet,&mdash;above all, the smile;&mdash;no, there was no mistaking
her; it was the blessed St. Bridget herself!</p>

<p class="indent">And what could have brought the sainted lady out of her
warm shrine at such a time of night? and on such a night? for it was as
dark as pitch, and, metaphorically speaking, "rained cats and dogs."</p>

<p class="indent">Emanuel could not speak, so he looked the question.</p>

<p class="indent">"No matter for that," said the Saint, answering to his thought.
"No matter for that, Emanuel Saddleton; only follow me, and you'll see."</p>

<p class="indent">The clerk turned a wistful eye at the corner-cupboard.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, never mind the lantern, Emanuel; you'll not want
it: but you may bring a mattock and shovel." As she spoke, the beautiful
apparition held up her delicate hand. From the tip of each of her
long taper fingers issued a lambent flame of such surpassing brilliancy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
as would have plunged a whole gas company into despair&mdash;it was a
"Hand of Glory," such a one as tradition tells us yet burns in Rochester
Castle every St. Mark's Eve. Many are the daring individuals
who have watched in Gundulph's Tower, hoping to find it, and the
treasure it guards;&mdash;but none of them ever did.</p>

<p class="indent">"This way, Emanuel!" and a flame of peculiar radiance streamed
from her little finger as it pointed to the pathway leading to the churchyard.</p>

<p class="indent">Saddleton shouldered his tools, and followed in silence.</p>

<p class="indent">The cemetery of St. Bridget's was some half-mile distant
from the clerk's domicile, and adjoined a chapel dedicated to that illustrious
lady, who, after leading but a so-so life, had died in the odour of
sanctity. Emanuel Saddleton was fat and scant of breath, the mattock
was heavy, and the saint walked too fast for him: he paused to
take second wind at the end of the first furlong.</p>

<p class="indent">"Emanuel," said the holy lady good-humouredly, for she heard
him puffing; "rest a while, Emanuel, and I'll tell you what I want with you."</p>

<p class="indent">Her auditor wiped his brow with the back of his hand,
and looked all attention and obedience.</p>

<p class="indent">"Emanuel," continued she, "what did you and Father Fothergill,
and the rest of you, mean yesterday by burying that drowned man
so close to me? He died in mortal sin, Emanuel; no shrift, no unction,
no absolution: why, he might as well have been excommunicated.
He plagues me with his grinning, and I can't have any peace
in my shrine. You must howk him up again, Emanuel!"</p>

<p class="indent">"To be sure, madam,&mdash;my lady,&mdash;that is, your
holiness," stammered Saddleton, trembling at the thought of the task assigned
him. "To be sure, your ladyship; only&mdash;that is&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">"Emanuel," said the Saint, "you'll do my bidding;
or it would be better you had!" and her eye changed from a dove's eye to that
of a hawk, and a flash came from it as bright as the one from her little
finger. The Clerk shook in his shoes, and, again dashing the cold
perspiration from his brow, followed the footsteps of his mysterious guide.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent space-above1">The next morning all Chatham was in an uproar.
The Clerk of St. Bridget's had found himself at home at daybreak, seated in
his own arm-chair, the fire out, and&mdash;the tankard of ale quite exhausted.
Who had drunk it? Where had he been? How had he got home?&mdash;all
was a mystery: he remembered "a mass of things, but nothing
distinctly;" all was fog and fantasy. What he could clearly recollect
was, that he had dug up the grinning sailor, and that the Saint had
helped to throw him into the river again. All was thenceforth wonderment
and devotion. Masses were sung, tapers were kindled, bells
were tolled; the monks of St. Romuald had a solemn procession,
the abbot at their head, the sacristan at their tail, and the holy
breeches of St. Thomas-à-Becket in the centre; Father Fothergill
brewed a XXX puncheon of holy-water. The Rood of Gillingham was
deserted; the chapel of Rainham forsaken; every one who had a soul
to be saved flocked with his offering to St. Bridget's shrine, and
Emanuel Saddleton gathered more fees from the promiscuous piety of
that one week than he had pocketed during the twelve preceding months.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the corpse of the ejected reprobate oscillated
like a pendulum between Sheerness and Gillingham Reach. Now borne by the
Medway into the Western Swale, now carried by the refluent tide
back to the vicinity of its old quarters, it seemed as though the River
god and Neptune were amusing themselves with a game of subaqueous
battledore, and had chosen this unfortunate carcass as a marine
shuttlecock. For some time the alternation was kept up with great spirit,
till Boreas, interfering in the shape of a stiffish "Nor'-wester," drifted
the bone (and flesh) of contention ashore on the Shurland domain,
where it lay in all the majesty of mud. It was soon discovered by
the retainers, and dragged from its oozy bed, grinning worse than
ever. Tidings of the god-send were of course carried instantly to the
castle, for the Baron was a very great man; and if a dun crow had
flown across his property unannounced by the warder, the Baron would
have kicked him, the said warder, from the topmost battlement into
the bottommost ditch,&mdash;a descent of peril, and one which "Ludwig
the leaper," or the illustrious Trenk himself, might well have shrunk
from encountering.</p>

<p class="indent">"An't please your lordship&mdash;" said Peter Periwinkle.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, villain! it does not please me!" roared the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">His lordship was deeply engaged with a peck of Feversham
oysters,&mdash;he doted on shellfish, hated interruption at meals, and had not
yet despatched more than twenty dozen of the "natives."</p>

<p class="indent">"There's a body, my lord, washed ashore in the lower creek,"
said the seneschal.</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron was going to throw the shells at his head;
but paused in the act, and said with much dignity,</p>

<p class="indent">"Turn out the fellow's pockets!"</p>

<p class="indent">But the defunct had before been subjected to the double scrutiny
of Father Fothergill and the Clerk of St. Bridget's. It was ill gleaning
after such hands; there was not a single marvedi.</p>

<p class="indent">We have already said that Sir Ralph de Shurland, Lord of
the Isle of Sheppey, and of many a fair manor on the main-land, was a man of
worship. He had rights of freewarren, saccage and sockage, cuisage
and jambage, fosse and fork, infang theofe and outfang theofe; and all
waifs and strays belonged to him in fee simple.</p>

<p class="indent">"Turn out his pockets!" said the Knight.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please you, my lord, I must say as how they was turned out
afore, and the devil a rap's left."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then bury the blackguard!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Please your lordship, he has been buried once."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then bury him again, and be&mdash;&mdash;!"
The Baron bestowed a benediction.</p>

<p class="indent">The seneschal bowed low as he left the room, and the Baron
went on with his oysters.</p>

<p class="indent">Scarce ten dozen more had vanished when Periwinkle reappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">"An't please you, my lord, Father Fothergill says as how
that it's the Grinning Sailor, and he won't bury him anyhow."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! he won't&mdash;won't he?" said the Baron. Can it be
wondered at that he called for his boots?</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Ralph de Shurland, Lord of Shurland and Minster, Baron
of Sheppey <i>in comitatu</i> Kent, was, as has been before hinted, a very
great man. He was also a very little man; that is, he was relatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
great and relatively little,&mdash;or physically little and metaphorically
great,&mdash;like Sir Sidney Smith and the late Mr. Bonaparte. To the
frame of a dwarf he united the soul of a giant and the valour of a
gamecock. Then, for so small a man, his strength was prodigious;
his fist would fell an ox, and his kick&mdash;oh! his kick was tremendous,
and, when he had his boots on, would,&mdash;to use an expression of his own,
which he had picked up in the holy wars,&mdash;would send a man from
Jericho to June. He was bull-necked and bandy-legged; his chest
was broad and deep, his head large, and uncommonly thick, his eyes
a little blood-shot, and his nose <i>retrousé</i> with a remarkably red tip.
Strictly speaking, the Baron could not be called handsome; but his
<i>tout ensemble</i> was singularly impressive: and when he called for his
boots, everybody trembled, and dreaded the worst.</p>

<p class="indent">"Periwinkle," said the Baron, as he encased his better
leg, "let the grave be twenty feet deep!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Your lordship's command is law."</p>

<p class="indent">"And, Periwinkle,"&mdash;Sir Ralph stamped his left heel into
its receptacle,&mdash;"and, Periwinkle, see that it be wide enough to hold not
exceeding two!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="indent">"And, Periwinkle,&mdash;tell Father Fothergill I would
fain speak with his reverence."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes, my lord."</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron's beard was picked, and his moustaches, stiff
and stumpy, projected horizontally like those of a Tom-cat; he twirled the
one, stroked the other, drew the buckle of his surcingle a thought
tighter, and strode down the great staircase three steps at a stride.</p>

<p class="indent">The vassals were assembled in the great hall of Shurland
Castle; every cheek was pale, every tongue was mute, expectation and perplexity
were visible on every brow. What would his lordship do?
Were the recusant anybody else, gyves to the heels and hemp to the
throat were but too good for him: but it was Father Fothergill who had
said "I won't;" and, though the Baron was a very great man, the Pope
was a greater, and the Pope was Father Fothergill's great friend&mdash;some
people said he was his uncle.</p>

<p class="indent">Father Fothergill was busy in the refectory trying conclusions
with a venison pasty, when he received the summons of his patron to
attend him in the chapel cemetery. Of course he lost no time in
obeying it, for obedience was the general rule in Shurland Castle. If
anybody ever said "I won't," it was the exception; and, like all other
exceptions, only proved the rule the stronger. The Father was a friar
of the Augustine persuasion; a brotherhood which, having been
planted in Kent some few centuries earlier, had taken very kindly to
the soil, and overspread the county much as hops did some few centuries
later. He was plump and portly, a little thick-winded, especially
after dinner, stood five feet four in his sandals, and weighed
hard upon eighteen stone. He was moreover a personage of singular
piety; and the iron girdle, which, he said, he wore under his cassock
to mortify withal, might have been well mistaken for the tire of a
cart-wheel. When he arrived, Sir Ralph was pacing up and down by
the side of a newly-opened grave.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Benedicite!</i> fair son,"&mdash;(the Baron was as brown
as a cigar,) &mdash;"<i>Benedicite!</i>" said the chaplain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The Baron was too angry to stand upon compliment.&mdash;"Bury
me that grinning caitiff there!" quoth he, pointing to the defunct.</p>

<p class="indent">"It may not be, fair son," said the Friar; "he hath perished
without absolution."</p>

<p class="indent">"Bury the body!" roared Sir Ralph.</p>

<p class="indent">"Water and earth alike reject him," returned the chaplain;
"holy St. Bridget herself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Bridget me no Bridgets! do me thine office quickly, Sir
Shaveling; or, by the piper that played before Moses!&mdash;&mdash;" The oath was
a fearful one; and whenever the Baron swore to do mischief, he was
never known to perjure himself. He was playing with the hilt of
his sword.&mdash;"Do me thine office, I say. Give him his passport to heaven!"</p>

<p class="indent">"He is already gone to hell!" stammered the friar.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then do you go after him!" thundered the Lord of Shurland.</p>

<p class="indent">His sword half leaped from its scabbard. No!&mdash;the
trenchant blade that had cut Suleiman Ben Malek Ben Buckskin from helmet
to chine disdained to daub itself with the cerebellum of a miserable
monk: it leaped back again; and as the chaplain, scared at its flash,
turned him in terror, the Baron gave him a kick!&mdash;one kick!&mdash;it was
but one!&mdash;but such a one! Despite its obesity, up flew his holy
body in an angle of forty-five degrees; then, having reached its highest
point of elevation, sunk headlong into the open grave that yawned to
receive it. If the reverend gentleman had possessed a neck, he had
infallibly broken it; as he did not, he only dislocated his vertebræ,&mdash;but
that did quite as well. He was as dead as ditch-water.</p>

<p class="indent">"In with the other rascal!" said the Baron, and he was
obeyed; for there he stood in his boots. Mattock and shovel made short work
of it; twenty feet of superincumbent mould pressed down alike the saint
and the sinner. "Now sing a requiem who list!" said the Baron, and
his lordship went back to his oysters.</p>

<p class="indent">The vassals at Castle Shurland were astounded, or, as
the seneschal Hugh better expressed it, "perfectly conglomerated," by this
event. What! murder a monk in the odour of sanctity,&mdash;and
on consecrated ground too! They trembled for the health of the
Baron's soul. To the unsophisticated many it seemed that matters
could not have been much worse had he shot a bishop's coach-horse;&mdash;all
looked for some signal judgment. The melancholy catastrophe
of their neighbours at Canterbury was yet rife in their memories: not
two centuries had elapsed since those miserable sinners had cut off
the tail of St. Thomas's mule. The tail of the mule, it was well
known, had been forthwith affixed to that of the mayor; and rumour
said it had since been hereditary in the corporation. The least that
could be expected was, that Sir Ralph should have a friar tacked on
to his for the term of his natural life! Some bolder spirits there were,
'tis true, who viewed the matter in various lights, according to their
different temperaments and dispositions; for perfect unanimity existed
not even in the good old times. The verderer, roistering Hob Roebuck,
swore roundly, "'Twere as good a deed as eat to kick down
the chapel as well as the monk."&mdash;Hob had stood there in a white
sheet for kissing Giles Miller's daughter.&mdash;On the other hand, Simpkin
Agnew, the bell-ringer, doubted if the devil's cellar, which
runs under the bottomless abyss, were quite deep enough for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
delinquent, and speculated on the probability of a hole being dug in
it for his especial accommodation. The philosophers and economists
thought with Saunders M'Bullock, the Baron's bagpiper, that "a feckless
monk more or less was nae great subject for a clamjamphry," especially
as "the supply considerably exceeded the demand;" while
Malthouse, the tapster, was arguing to Dame Martin that a murder
now and then was a seasonable check to population, without which
the Isle of Sheppey would in time be devoured, like a mouldy cheese,
by inhabitants of its own producing. Meanwhile, the Baron ate his
oysters, and thought no more of the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">But this tranquillity of his lordship was not to last. A
couple of Saints had been seriously offended; and we have all of us read at
school that celestial minds are by no means insensible to the provocations
of anger. There were those who expected that St. Bridget
would come in person, and have the friar up again as she did the
sailor; but perhaps her ladyship did not care to trust herself within
the walls of Shurland Castle. To say the truth, it was scarcely a decent
house for a female Saint to be seen in. The Baron's gallantries,
since he became a widower, had been but too notorious; and her
own reputation was a little blown upon in the earlier days of her
earthly pilgrimage: then things were so apt to be misrepresented: in
short, she would leave the whole affair to St. Austin, who, being a
gentleman, could interfere with propriety, avenge her affront as well as
his own, and leave no loop-hole for scandal. St. Austin himself seems
to have had his scruples, though of their precise nature it were difficult
to determine, for it were idle to suppose him at all afraid of the
Baron's boots. Be this as it may, the mode which he adopted was at
once prudent and efficacious. As an ecclesiastic, he could not well
call the Baron out, had his boots been out of the question; so he resolved
to have recourse to the law. Instead of Shurland Castle, therefore,
he repaired forthwith to his own magnificent monastery, situate
just without the walls of Canterbury, and presented himself in a vision
to its abbot. No one who has ever visited that ancient city can fail
to recollect the splendid gateway which terminates the vista of St.
Paul's street, and stands there yet in all its pristine beauty. The
tiny train of miniature artillery which now adorns its battlements is,
it is true, an ornament of a later date; and is said to have been added
some centuries after by some learned but jealous proprietor, for the
purpose of shooting any wiser man than himself who might chance to
come that way. Tradition is silent as to any discharge having taken
place, nor can the oldest inhabitant of modern days recollect any such
occurrence. Here it was, in a handsome chamber, immediately over
the lofty archway, that the superior of the monastery lay buried in a
brief slumber snatched from his accustomed vigils. His mitre&mdash;for
he was a mitred abbot, and had a seat in parliament&mdash;rested on a
table beside him; near it stood a silver flagon of Gascony wine, ready,
no doubt, for the pious uses of the morrow. Fasting and watching
had made him more than usually somnolent, than which nothing could
have been better for the purpose of the Saint, who now appeared to
him radiant in all the colours of the rainbow.</p>

<p class="indent">"Anselm!"&mdash;said the beatific vision,&mdash;"Anselm! are
you not a pretty fellow to lie snoring there, when your brethren are being
knocked at head, and Mother Church herself is menaced!
It is a sin and a shame, Anselm!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"What's the matter?&mdash;Who are you?" cried the Abbot,
rubbing his eyes, which the celestial splendour of his visiter had set a-winking.
"Ave Maria! St. Austin himself!&mdash;Speak, <i>Beatissime</i>! what would
you with the humblest of your votaries?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Anselm!" said the Saint, "a brother of our order, whose
soul Heaven assoilzie! hath been foully murdered. He hath been ignominiously
kicked to the death, Anselm; and there he lieth cheek-by-jowl
with a wretched carcass, which our sister Bridget has turned out of
her cemetery for unseemly grinning. Arouse thee, Anselm!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, so please you, <i>Sanctissime</i>!" said the Abbot:
"I will order forthwith that thirty masses be said, thirty <i>Paters</i>,
and thirty <i>Aves</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thirty fools' heads!" interrupted his patron,
who was a little peppery.</p>

<p class="indent">"I will send for bell, book, and candle."</p>

<p class="indent">"Send for an inkhorn, Anselm. Write me now a letter to
his Holiness the Pope in good round terms, and another to the coroner, and
another to the sheriff and seize me the never-enough-to-be-anathematised
villain who hath done this deed! Hang him as high as Haman,
Anselm!&mdash;up with him!&mdash;down with his dwelling-place, root
and branch, hearth-stone and roof-tree,&mdash;down with it all, and sow the
site with salt and sawdust!"</p>

<p class="indent">St. Austin, it will be perceived, was a radical reformer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Marry will I," quoth the Abbot, warming with the Saint's
eloquence; "ay, marry will I, and that <i>instanter</i>. But there is one
thing you have forgotten, most Beatified&mdash;the name of the culprit."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ralph de Shurland."</p>

<p class="indent">"The Lord of Sheppey! Bless me!" said the Abbot, crossing
himself, "won't that be rather inconvenient? Sir Ralph is a bold baron
and a powerful; blows will come and go, and crowns will be
cracked, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"What is that to you, since yours will not be of the number?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Very true, <i>Beatissime</i>! I will don me with speed, and do
your bidding."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do so, Anselm!&mdash;fail not to hang the baron, burn his castle,
confiscate his estate, and buy me two large wax-candles for my own particular
shrine out of your share of the property."</p>

<p class="indent">With this solemn injunction the vision began to fade.</p>

<p class="indent">"One thing more!" cried the Abbot, grasping his rosary.</p>

<p class="indent">"What is that?" asked the Saint.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>O Beate Augustine, ora pro nobis!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of course I shall," said St. Austin.
"<i>Pax vobiscum!</i>"&mdash;and Abbot Anselm was left alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Within an hour all Canterbury was in commotion. A friar had
been murdered,&mdash;two friars&mdash;ten&mdash;twenty; a whole convent had
been assaulted,&mdash;sacked,&mdash;burnt,&mdash;all the monks had been killed,
and all the nuns had been kissed! Murder!&mdash;fire!&mdash;sacrilege! Never
was city in such an uproar. From St. George's gate to St. Dunstan's
suburb, from the Donjon to the borough of Staplegate, all was noise
and hubbub. "Where was it?"&mdash;"When was it?"&mdash;"How was it?"
The Mayor caught up his chain, the Aldermen donned their furred
gowns, the Town-clerk put on his spectacles. "Who was he?"&mdash;"What
was he?"&mdash;"Where was he?"&mdash;he should be hanged,&mdash;he
should be burned,&mdash;he should be broiled,&mdash;he should be fried,&mdash;he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
should be scraped to death with red-hot oyster-shells! "Who was
he?"&mdash;"What was his name?"</p>

<p class="indent">The abbot's Apparitor drew forth his roll and read
aloud: "Sir Ralph de Shurland, Knight banneret, Baron of Shurland and
Minster, and Lord of Sheppey."</p>

<p class="indent">The Mayor put his chain in his pocket, the Aldermen took off
their gowns, the Town-clerk put his pen behind his ear,&mdash;It was a county
business altogether: the Sheriff had better call out the
<i>posse comitatus</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">While saints and sinners were thus leaguing against him, the
Baron de Shurland was quietly eating his breakfast. He had passed a tranquil
night, undisturbed by dreams of cowl or capuchin; nor was his
appetite more affected than his conscience. On the contrary, he sat
rather longer over his meal than usual; luncheon-time came, and he was
ready as ever for his oysters; but scarcely had Dame Martin opened
his first half-dozen when the warder's horn was heard from the barbican.</p>

<p class="indent">"Who the devil's that?" said Sir Ralph. "I'm not at home,
Periwinkle. I hate to be disturbed at meals, and I won't be at home to anybody."</p>

<p class="indent">"An't please your lordship," answered the seneschal,
"Paul Prior hath given notice that there is a body&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Another body!" roared the Baron. "Am I to be everlastingly
plagued with bodies? No time allowed me to swallow a morsel.
Throw it into the moat!"</p>

<p class="indent">"So please you, my lord, it is a body of horse,&mdash;and&mdash;and
Paul says there is a still larger body of foot behind it; and he thinks,
my lord,&mdash;that is, he does not know, but he thinks&mdash;and we all
think, my lord, that they are coming to&mdash;to besiege the castle!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Besiege the castle! Who? What? What for?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Paul says, my lord, that he can see the banner of St. Austin,
and the bleeding heart of Hamo de Crevec&oelig;ur, the abbot's chief vassal;
and there is John de Northwood, the sheriff, with his red-cross engrailed;
and Hever, and Leybourne, and Heaven knows how many
more; and they are all coming on as fast as ever they can."</p>

<p class="indent">"Periwinkle," said the Baron, "up with the drawbridge; down
with the portcullis; bring me a cup of canary, and my night-cap. I
won't be bothered with them. I shall go to bed."</p>

<p class="indent">"To bed, my lord!" cried Periwinkle, with a look
that seemed to say, "He's crazy."</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment the shrill tones of a trumpet were heard to
sound thrice from the champaign. It was the signal for parley: the Baron
changed his mind; instead of going to bed, he went to the ramparts.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, rapscallions! and what now?" said the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">A herald, two pursuivants, and a trumpeter, occupied the
foreground of the scene; behind them, some three hundred paces off, upon
a rising ground, was drawn up in battle-array the main body of the
ecclesiastical forces.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hear you, Ralph de Shurland, Knight, Baron of Shurland
and Minster, and Lord of Sheppey, and know all men, by these presents,
that I do hereby attach you, the said Ralph, of murder and sacrilege,
now, or of late, done and committed by you, the said Ralph, contrary
to the peace of our Sovereign Lord the King, his crown and dignity:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
and I do hereby require and charge you, the said Ralph, to forthwith
surrender and give up your own proper person, together with the castle
of Shurland aforesaid, in order that the same may be duly dealt
with according to law. And here standeth John de Northwood, Esquire,
good man and true, sheriff of this his majesty's most loyal county
of Kent, to enforce the same, if need be, with his <i>posse comitatus</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">"His what?" said the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">"His <i>posse comitatus</i>, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Go to Bath!" said the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">A defiance so contemptuous roused the ire of the adverse
commanders. A volley of missiles rattled about the Baron's ears. Night-caps
avail little against contusions. He left the walls, and returned
to the great hall.</p>

<p class="indent">"Let them pelt away," quoth the Baron; "there are no
windows to break, and they can't get in." So he took his afternoon nap,
and the siege went on.</p>

<p class="indent">Towards evening his lordship awoke, and grew tired of the din.
Guy Pearson, too, had got a black eye from a brick-bat, and the assailants
were clambering over the outer wall. So the Baron called for
his Sunday hauberk of Milan steel, and his great two-handed sword
with the terrible name:&mdash;it was the fashion in feudal times to give
names to swords; King Arthur's was christened Excalibar; the
Baron called his Tickletoby, and whenever he took it in hand it was
no joke.</p>

<p class="indent">"Up with the portcullis! down with the bridge!" said Sir
Ralph; and out he sallied, followed by the <i>élite</i> of his retainers.
Then there was a pretty to-do. Heads flew one
way&mdash;arms and legs another; round
went Tickletoby, and, wherever it alighted, down came horse and
man: the Baron excelled himself that day. All that he had done in
Palestine faded in the comparison; he had fought for fun there, but
now it was for life and lands. Away went John de Northwood; away
went William of Hever, and Roger of Leybourne. Hamo de Crevec&oelig;r,
with the church vassals and the banner of St. Austin, had been
gone some time. The siege was raised, and the Lord of Sheppey left
alone in his glory.</p>

<p class="indent">But, brave as the Baron undoubtedly was, and total as had
been the defeat of his enemies, it cannot be supposed that <i>La Stoccata</i>
would be allowed to carry it away thus. It has before been hinted that
Abbot Anselm had written to the Pope, and Boniface the Eighth
piqued himself on his punctuality as a correspondent in all matters
connected with church discipline. He sent back an answer by return
of post; and by it all Christian people were strictly enjoined to aid in
exterminating the offender, on pain of the greater excommunication
in this world, and a million of years of purgatory in the next. But
then, again, Boniface the Eighth was rather at a discount in England
just then. He had affronted Longshanks, as the loyal lieges had nicknamed
their monarch; and Longshanks had been rather sharp upon
the clergy in consequence. If the Baron de Shurland could but get
the King's pardon for what in his cooler moments he admitted to be a
peccadillo, he might sniff at the Pope, and bid him "do his devilmost."</p>

<p class="indent">Fortune, who, as the poet says, delights to favour the bold,
stood his friend on this occasion. Edward had been, for some time, collecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
a large force on the coast of Kent, to carry on his French wars
for the recovery of Guienne; he was expected shortly to review it in
person; but, then, the troops lay principally in cantonments about the
mouth of the Thames, and his majesty was to come down by water.
What was to be done?&mdash;the royal barge was in sight, and John de
Northwood and Hamo de Crevec&oelig;ur had broken up all the boats to
boil their camp-kettles. A truly great mind is never without resources.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bring me my boots!" said the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent">They brought him his boots, and his dapple-grey steed along
with them. Such a courser! all blood and bone, short-backed, broad-chested,
and, but that he was a little ewe-necked, faultless in form and figure.
The Baron sprang upon his back, and dashed at once into the river.</p>

<p class="indent">The barge which carried Edward Longshanks and his fortunes
had by this time nearly reached the Nore; the stream was broad and the
current strong, but Sir Ralph and his steed were almost as broad, and
stronger. After breasting the tide gallantly for a couple of miles, the
Knight was near enough to hail the steersman.</p>

<p class="indent">"What have we got here?" said the king. "It's a mermaid,"
said one. "It's a grampus," said another. "It's the devil," said a
third. But they were all wrong; it was only Ralph de Shurland.
"Grammercy," quoth the king, "that fellow was never born to be drowned!"</p>

<p class="indent">It has been said before that the Baron had fought in the
holy wars; in fact, he had accompanied Longshanks, when only heir-apparent, in
his expedition twenty-five years before, although his name is unaccountably
omitted by Sir Harris Nicolas in his list of crusaders. He had
been present at Acre when Amirand of Joppa stabbed the prince with
a poisoned dagger, and had lent Princess Eleanor his own toothbrush
after she had sucked out the venom from the wound. He had slain
certain Saracens, contented himself with his own plunder, and never
dunned the commissariat for arrears of pay. Of course he ranked high
in Edward's good graces, and had received the honour of knighthood
at his hands on the field of battle.</p>

<p class="indent">In one so circumstanced it cannot be supposed that such a
trifle as the killing a frowzy friar would be much resented, even had he not
taken so bold a measure to obtain his pardon. His petition was
granted, of course, as soon as asked; and so it would have been had
the indictment drawn up by the Canterbury town-clerk, viz. "That
he, the said Ralph de Shurland, &amp;c. had then and there, with several,
to wit, one thousand, pair of boots, given sundry, to wit, two thousand,
kicks, and therewith and thereby killed divers, to wit, ten thousand,
Austin friars," been true to the letter.</p>

<p class="indent">Thrice did the gallant Grey circumnavigate the barge,
while Robert de Winchelsey, the chancellor, and archbishop to boot, was
making out, albeit with great reluctance, the royal pardon. The interval
was sufficiently long to enable his majesty, who, gracious as he
was, had always an eye to business, just to hint that the gratitude he
felt towards the Baron was not unmixed with a lively sense of services
to come; and that, if life was now spared him, common decency
must oblige him to make himself useful. Before the archbishop, who
had scalded his fingers with the wax in affixing the great seal, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
time to take them out of his mouth, all was settled, and the Baron de
Shurland, <i>cum suis</i>, had pledged himself to be forthwith in readiness
to accompany his liege lord to Guienne.</p>

<p class="indent">With the royal pardon secured in his vest, boldly did his
lordship turn again to the shore; and as boldly did his courser oppose his
breadth of chest to the stream. It was a work of no common difficulty
or danger; a steed of less "mettle and bone" had long since
sunk in the effort: as it was, the Baron's boots were full of water,
and Grey Dolphin's chamfrain more than once dipped beneath the
wave. The convulsive snorts of the noble animal showed his distress;
each instant they became more loud and frequent; when his hoof
touched the strand, and "the horse and his rider" stood again in safety
on the shore.</p>

<p class="indent">Rapidly dismounting, the Baron was loosening the girths
of his demi-pique, to give the panting animal breath, when he was aware
of as ugly an old woman as he ever clapped eyes upon, peeping at
him under the horse's belly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Make much of your steed, Ralph Shurland! Make much of
your steed!" cried the hag, shaking at him her long and bony finger.
"Groom to the hide, and corn to the manger. He has saved your
life, Ralph Shurland, for the nonce; but he shall yet be the means
of your losing it, for all that!"</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron started: "What's that you say, you old faggot?"
He ran round by his horse's tail; the women was gone!</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron paused; his great soul was not to be shaken by
trifles; he looked around him, and solemnly ejaculated the word "Humbug!"
then, slinging the bridle across his arm, walked slowly on in the
direction of the castle.</p>

<p class="indent">The appearance, and still more, the disappearance of
the crone, had however made an impression; every step he took he became
more thoughtful. "'Twould be deuced provoking though, if he
<i>should</i> break my neck after all!" He turned, and gazed at Dolphin
with the scrutinizing eye of a veterinary surgeon.&mdash;"I'll be shot if
he is not groggy!" said the Baron.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">With his lordship, like another great Commander,
"Once to be in doubt, was once to be resolved:" it would never do to go to the
wars on a rickety prad. He dropped the rein, drew forth Tickletoby, and,
as the enfranchised Dolphin, good easy horse, stretched out his ewe-neck
to the herbage, struck off his head at a single blow. "There,
you lying old beldame!" said the Baron; "now take him away to the knackers."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent space-above1">Three years were come and gone. King Edward's
French wars were over; both parties, having fought till they came to a stand-still,
shook hands; and the quarrel, as usual, was patched up by a royal marriage.
This happy event gave his majesty leisure to turn his attention to
Scotland, where things, through the intervention of William Wallace,
were looking rather queerish. As his reconciliation with Philip now
allowed of his fighting the Scotch in peace and quietness, the monarch
lost no time in marching his long legs across the border, and
the short ones of the Baron followed him of course. At Falkirk,
Tickletoby was in great request; and, in the year following, we find a
contemporary poet hinting at its master's prowess under the walls of Caerlaverock,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Obec eus fu achiminez</span>
<span class="i0">Li beau Rafe de Shurlande</span>
<span class="i0">Ki kant seoit sur le cheval</span>
<span class="i0">Ne sembloit home le someille.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">A quatrain which Mr. Simpkinson translates,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With them was marching</span>
<span class="i0">The good Ralph de Shurland,</span>
<span class="i0">Who, when seated on horseback,</span>
<span class="i0">Does not resemble a man asleep!"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">So thoroughly awake, indeed, does he seem to have proved himself,
that the bard subsequently exclaims, in an ecstasy of admiration,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Si ie estoie une pucellette</span>
<span class="i0">Je li donroie ceur et cors</span>

<span class="i0">"If I were a young maiden,</span>
<span class="i0">I would give him my heart and person,</span>
<span class="i0">So great is his fame!"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Fortunately the poet was a tough old monk of Exeter; since
such a present to a nobleman, now in his grand climacteric, would hardly
have been worth the carriage. With the reduction of this stronghold
of the Maxwells seem to have concluded the Baron's military services;
as on the very first day of the fourteenth century we find him once
more landed on his native shore, and marching, with such of his retainers
as the wars had left him, towards the hospitable shelter of
Shurland Castle. It was then, upon that very beach, some hundred
yards distant from high-water mark, that his eye fell upon something
like an ugly old woman in a red cloak. She was seated on
what seemed to be a large stone, in an interesting attitude, with her
elbows resting upon her knees and her chin upon her thumbs. The
Baron started: the remembrance of his interview with a similar personage
in the same place, some three years since, flashed upon his
recollection. He rushed towards the spot, but the form was gone;
nothing remained but the seat it had appeared to occupy. This, on
examination, turned out to be no stone, but the whitened skull of a
dead horse. A tender remembrance of the deceased Grey Dolphin shot
a momentary pang into the Baron's bosom; he drew the back of his
hand across his face; the thought of the hag's prediction in an instant
rose, and banished all softer emotions. In utter contempt of his own
weakness, yet with a tremor that deprived his redoubtable kick of
half its wonted force, he spurned the relic with his foot. One word
alone issued from his lips elucidatory of what was passing in his
mind,&mdash;it long remained imprinted on the memory of his faithful
followers,&mdash;that word was "Gammon!" The skull bounded across
the beach till it reached the very margin of the stream;&mdash;one instant
more, and it would be engulfed for ever. At that moment a loud
"Ha! ha! ha!" was distinctly heard by the whole train to issue
from its bleached and toothless jaws: it sank beneath the flood in a horse-laugh!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Sir Ralph de Shurland felt an odd sort of sensation
in his right foot. His boots had suffered in the wars. Great pains had
been taken for their preservation. They had been "soled" and "heeled"
more than once;&mdash;had they been "galoshed," their owner might
have defied Fate! Well has it been said that "there is no such thing
as a trifle." A nobleman's life depended upon a question of ninepence.</p>

<p class="indent">The Baron marched on; the uneasiness in his foot increased.
He plucked off his boot; a horse's tooth was sticking in his great toe!</p>

<p class="indent">The result may be anticipated. Lame as he was, his lordship,
with characteristic decision would hobble on to Shurland; his walk increased
the inflammation; a flagon of <i>aqua vitæ</i> did not mend matters.
He was in a high fever; he took to his bed. Next morning the
toe presented the appearance of a Bedfordshire carrot; by dinner-time
it had deepened to beetroot; and when Bargrave, the leech, at last
sliced it off, the gangrene was too confirmed to admit of remedy.
Dame Martin thought it high time to send for Miss Margaret, who,
ever since her mother's death, had been living with her maternal aunt,
the abbess, in the Ursuline convent of Greenwich. The young lady
came, and with her came one Master Ingoldsby, her cousin-german
by the mother's side; but the Baron was too far gone in the deadthraw
to recognise either. He died as he lived, unconquered and unconquerable.
His last words were&mdash;"Tell the old hag to go to&mdash;&mdash;."
Whither remains a secret. He expired without fully articulating the
place of her destination.</p>

<p class="indent">But who and what was the crone who prophesied the catastrophe?
Ay, "that is the mystery of this wonderful history."&mdash;Some said it
was Dame Fothergill, the late confessor's mamma; others, St. Bridget
herself; others thought it was nobody at all, but only a phantom
conjured up by Conscience. As we do not know, we decline giving an
opinion.</p>

<p class="indent">And what became of the Clerk of Chatham? Mr. Simpkinson
avers than he lived to a good old age, and was at last hanged by Jack Cade,
with his inkhorn about his neck, for "setting boys copies." In support
of this he adduces his name "Emanuel," and refers to the historian
Shakspeare. Mr. Peters, on the contrary, considers this to be
what he calls one of Mr. Simpkinson's "Anacreonisms," inasmuch as,
at the introduction of Mr. Cade's reform measure, the clerk would
have been hard upon two hundred years old. The probability is, that
the unfortunate alluded to was his great-grandson.</p>

<p class="indent">Margaret Shurland in due course became Margaret Ingoldsby,
her portrait still hangs in the gallery at Tappington. The features are
handsome, but shrewish, betraying, as it were, a touch of the old Baron's
temperament; but we never could learn that she actually kicked her
husband. She brought him a very pretty fortune in chains, owches,
and Saracen ear-rings; the barony, being a male fief, reverted to the
crown.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">In the abbey-church at Minster may yet be seen
the tomb of a recumbent warrior, clad in the chain-mail of the 13th century.
His hands are clasped in prayer; his legs, crossed in that position so
prized by Templars in ancient, and tailors in modern, days, bespeak
him a soldier of the Faith in Palestine. Close to his great-toe, lies
sculptured in bold relief a horse's head; and a respectable elderly
lady, as she shows the monument, fails not to read her auditors a fine
moral lesson on the sin of ingratitude, or to claim a sympathising
tear to the memory of poor "Grey Dolphin!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IN THE LIFE OF A STATESMAN,</h2>
<p class="f90">BEING INEDITED LETTERS OF ADDISON.</p>
<p class="f90">NOW FIRST PRINTED FROM THE AUTOGRAPH ORIGINALS.</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">The following letters, which have never before been
published, are exceedingly curious, as exhibiting Addison in a new point of view,
and as displaying traits in that celebrated man's character, differing
very materially from those which his biographers have recorded. They
are addressed to Charles Montague, Earl of Halifax, and to Monsieur
Robethon, secretary to the Elector of Hanover, afterwards George the
First of England. They represent Addison as eager for place and
pension, yearning after pecuniary reward, dwelling upon services unrequited,
urging his utmost interest to procure some new emoluments,
and discontentedly comparing his own condition with that of other more
fortunate placemen. Leaving the letters to speak for themselves, it
is only necessary to add that they are accompanied by a few notes which
furnish some new data in the family history of the writer.</p>

<p class="f90 space-above1">TO CHARLES MONTAGUE, EARL OF HALIFAX.</p>

<p class="author"><br />Dublin Castle, May 7, 1709.</p>
<p class="blockquot indent"><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I am glad of any
occasion of paying my duty to your lordship, and therefore cannot but lay hold of this,
in transmitting to your lordship our Lord Lieutenant's<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
speech at the opening of the parliament, with a couple of addresses from the House
of Commons upon that occasion. Your lordship will see by them that all parties
have set out in good-humour, which is entirely owing to his excellency's
conduct, who has addressed himself so all sorts of men since
his arrival here, with unspeakable application. They were under
great apprehensions, at his first coming, that he would drive directly
at repealing the Test, and had formed themselves into a very strong
body for its defence; but, as their minds are at present pretty quiet
upon that head, they appear willing to enter into all other measures
that he would have them. Had he proceeded otherwise, it is easie
to see that all things would have been thrown into the utmost confusion,
and a stop put to all public business. His excellency, however,
gains ground daily; and I question not but in a new parliament,
where parties are not settled and confirmed, he will be able to lead
them into any thing that will be for their real interests and advantage.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">I have the happiness every day to drink your
lordship's health in very good wine,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
and with very honest gentlemen; and am ever, with the greatest respect, my lord,</p>
<p class="indent">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Your lordship's most obedient and most humble servant,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="smcap">J. Addison</span>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p class="f90 space-above2">TO M. DE ROBETHON, SECRETARY TO THE ELECTOR OF HANOVER.</p>
<p class="author"><br />St. James's, Sept. 4, 1714.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">
<span class="smcap">&emsp;Sir</span>,&mdash;I have been obliged to so close an attendance
on the Lords Justices, and have had so very little time at my own disposal during
my absence from their excellencies, that I could not do myself the
honour before now, to assure you of my respects, and to beg the continuance
of that friendship which you formerly honoured me with, at
Hanover.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
I cannot but extremely rejoice at the occasion, which
will give me on opportunity of waiting on you in England, where
you will find a whole nation in the highest joy, and thoroughly sensible
of the great blessings which they promise themselves from his
Majesty's accession to the throne.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">I take the liberty to send you, enclosed, a poem written
on this occasion by one of our most eminent hands, which is indeed a masterpiece
in its kind; and, though very short, has touched upon all the
topics which are most popular among us. I have likewise transmitted
to you, a copy of the preamble to the Prince of Wales's patent, which
was a very grateful task imposed upon me by the Lords Justices.
Their excellencies have ordered that the lords and others who meet
his Majesty, be out of mourning that day, as also their coaches; but
all servants, except those of the City magistrates, to be in mourning.
The shortness of the time, which would not be sufficient for the
making of new liveries, occasioned this last order.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">The removal of the Lord Bolingbroke<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
has put a seasonable check to an interest that was making in many places

<p class="blockquot indent">
&emsp;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Though I am not without hopes of seeing
you in England before this letter comes to your hands, I cannot defer returning you
my thanks for the honour of yours of the 17th N. S. which I received
this morning. I beg leave to send you the enclosed ceremonial for
the King's entry, published by the Earl of Suffolk, Deputy Earl Marshal,
as regulated by the Lords Justices and privy council.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
The Attorney-general is preparing a proclamation, reciting the rewards set
on the Pretender by the late Queen and Parliament, with the security
set for the payment, as established by a clause in an act passed since
his Majesty's accession to the throne. As such a proclamation is
very requisite; so, perhaps, it may come with a good grace from the
Regents before his Majesty's arrival. It will, I believe, be fixed up in
all the market-towns, especially among the highlands in Scotland,
where there has been some meetings, but, by the care of the Regents,
of no consequence.</p>
<p class="center">[Subscribed in the same words as the preceding.]</p>

<p class="f90 space-above2">TO THE EARL OF HALIFAX.</p>
<p class="author">Oct. 17, 1714.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">
<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I find by your lordship's discourse that you have your
reasons for laying aside the thought of bringing me into a part of
Lowndes's place;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
and, as I hope they do not proceed from any change
of goodwill towards me, I do entirely acquiesce in them. I know
that one in your lordship's high station has several opportunities of
showing favour to your dependants, as one of your generous temper
does not want to be reminded of it when any such offer. I must
therefore beg your lordship to believe that I think no more of what
you were pleased to mention in relation to the Treasury, though the
kind and condescending manner in which your lordship was pleased
to communicate yourself to me on that subject, shall always raise in
me the most constant and unfeigned zeal for your honour and service.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">
I fancy, if I had a friend to represent to his Majesty that I was sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
abroad by King William, and taken off from all other pursuits in order
to be employed in his service<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
&mdash;that I had the honour to wait on
your lordship to Hanover,&mdash;that the post I am now in, is the gift of
a particular lord [Sunderland], in whose service I have been employed
formerly,&mdash;that it is a great fall, in point of honour, from being secretary
to the Regents, and that their request to his Majesty still subsists
in my favour,&mdash;with other intimations that might perhaps be made
to my advantage,&mdash;I fancy, I say, that his Majestie, upon such a
representation, would be inclined to bestow on me some mark of his favour.
I protest to your lordship I never gained to the value of five thousand
pounds<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
by all the business I have yet been in; and, out of that, very
near a fourth part has been laid out in my elections.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
I should not insist on this subject so long, were it not taken notice of by some of
the Lords Justices themselves, as well as many others, that his Majestie
has yet done nothing for me, though it was once expected he would
have done something more considerable for me than I can at present
have the confidence to mention. As I have the honour to write to
your lordship, whose favour I have endeavoured to cultivate, and
should be very ambitious of deserving, I will humbly propose it to
your lordship's thoughts, whether his Majestie might not be inclined,
if I was mentioned to him, to put me in the Commission of Trade, or
in some honorary post about the Prince, or by some other method to
let the world see that I am not wholly disregarded by him. I am
ashamed to talk so long of myself; but, if your lordship will excuse
me this time, I will never more erre on this side. I shall only beg
leave to add, that I mentioned your lordship's kind intentions towards
me only to two persons. One of them was Phillips,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
whom I could not forbear acquainting, in the fulness of my heart, with the
kindness you had designed both him and me, which I take notice of because
I hope your lordship will have him in your thoughts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot indent">
Though I put by several importunities which are made me to
recommend persons and pretensions to your lordship, there are some
which I cannot resist, without declaring, what would go very much
against me, that I have no credit with your lordship. Of this kind is
a request made me yesterday by Lady Irby, that I would mention
her to your lordship as one who might be made easy in her fortune if
your lordship would be pleased to procure for her the place of a
bedchamber-woman to the Princess. I told her that places of that
nature were out of your lordship's province; but she tells me, as the
proper persons are not yet named to whom she should make her applications,
and as my Lord Townsend has gained the same favour for Mrs. Selwyn,
she hopes you will excuse her solicitation upon this occasion.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">
My Lord Dorchester, from whom I lately conveyed a letter to
your lordship, has likewise obliged me to speak in favour of Mr.
Young, who marryed a sister of Mr. Chetwynd's, and formerly was a
clerk under me in Ireland. He is now a man of estate, of honest
principles, and has been very serviceable to Lord Dorchester in the
elections at Salisbury.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">
I humbly beg leave to congratulate your lordship upon the honours
you have lately received; and whenever your lordship will allow me
to wait on you, I shall always value the honour of being admitted to
your conversation more than any place that can be given me.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">
<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;Upon my coming home this evening,
I found a letter left for me from your lordship which has raised in me a greater
satisfaction and sense of gratitude than I am able to express. Nothing
can be more acceptable to me than the place which I hope your lordship
has procured for me, and particularly because it may put me in
a way of improving myself under your lordship's directions. I will
not pretend to express my thanks to your lordship upon this occasion,
but should be glad to employ my whole life in it.</p>

my pretensions to the Board of Trade, I shall not trouble your lordship with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
resentments of the unhandsome treatment I have met with from some of
our new great men in every circumstance of that affair; but must beg
leave to express my gratitude to your lordship for the great favour
you have shown me on this occasion, which I shall never forget.
Young Craggs<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
told me, about a week ago, that his Majestie, though
he did not think fit to gratifie me in this particular, designed to give
me a recompense for my service under the Lords Justices, in which
case your lordship will probably be consulted. Since I find I am
never to rise above the station in which I first entered upon public
business, (for I begin to look upon myself like an old serjeant or corporal,)
I would willingly turn my secretaryships, in which I have
served five different masters, to the best advantage I can; and as
your lordship is the only patron I glory in, and have a dependence on,
I hope you will honour me with your countenance in this particular.
If I am offered less than a thousand pounds, I shall beg leave not to
accept it, since it will look more like a clerk's wages than a mark of
his Majesty's favour. I verily believe that his Majesty may think I
had fees and perquisites belonging to me under the Lords Justices;
but, though I was offered a present by the South Sea Company, I
never took that, nor anything else, for what I did, as knowing I had
no right to it. Were I of another temper, my present place in Ireland<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
might be as profitable to me as some have represented it. I
humbly beg your lordship's pardon for the trouble of such a letter,
and do assure your lordship that one of the greatest pleasures I shall
receive in whatever I get from the government will be its enabling
me to promote your honour and interest more effectually. I am informed,
Mr. Yard, besides a place and an annual recompense for
serving the Lords Justices [of Ireland] under King William, had considerable
fees, and was never at the charge of getting himself elected
into the House of Commons.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">
I beg your lordship will give me leave to add, that I believe I am  the first man that
ever drew up a Prince of Wales's preamble without so much as a medal for my pains.</p>

<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;Your lordship having given me leave
to acquaint you with the names and pretensions of persons who are importunate
with me to speak to your lordship in their behalf, I shall make use of that
liberty when I believe it may be of use to your lordship, or when I
cannot possibly resist the solicitation. I presumed to write to your
lordship in favour of Mr. Hungerford, who purchased of me in the
commission of Appeals. All I aske is, that he may enjoy the fruits of
his purchase: as for his recommending one to his place, I only hinted
at it, if his coming into the House might be of service to your lordship.
I would not have spoken of Mr. Wroth, had not he assured
me that he was first recommended to your lordship by my Lord
Cooper.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
He tells me since, he had the honour to be schoolfellow to
your lordship, and I know has a most entire respect for you, and I
believe is able to do his friends service.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">
The enclosed petition is of one who is brother to a particular
friend of mine at Oxford, and brought me a letter in his behalf from
Mr. Boscawen. If your lordship would be pleased to refer it to the
Commissioners of Customs, it would give me an opportunity of
obliging one who may be of service to me, and perhaps be a piece of
justice to one who seems to be a man of merit.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">
I must beg your lordship's patience for one more, at the request of
my Lord and Lady Warwick, especially since I hear your lordship
has formerly promised to do something for him. His name is Edward
Rich: he is to succeed to the title of the Earl of Warwick
should the young lord have no heir of his own.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
He is in great want, writes an extraordinary good hand, and would be glad
of a small place. He mentions in particular a King's tide-waiter.
Capt. Addison<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
tells me that he presumed to put your lordship
in mind of himself; but, as I hope to provide for him in Ireland,
I will not trouble you on his account. I have another namesake,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
who is well turned for greater business; but if he could have a
stamper's place, vacant by the death of one who was formerly my
servant, it would be a very great favour. I beg your lordship to pardon
this freedom, and I promise to use it very sparingly hereafter.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">
When your lordship is at leisure, I should be glad of a moment's
audience: in the mean time, I cannot conclude my letter without returning

which have been industriously spread abroad with relation to
his distemper, which is nothing else but the cholick, occasioned by a
too frequent use of vomits, to which the physicians adde the drinking
of small beer in too great quantities when he has found himself a

<h2>REMAINS OF HAJJI BABA.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="indent">I made my preparations with all haste. In addition to
my own servant, Sadek, who had been one of our suite in our former
mission, I hired two others; one to take care of my horses,
and another to spread my carpet. A mule for my baggage, a
good horse for my own riding, and two yaboos for my servants,
were soon procured; and, straightway, whip in hand, and with
boots on my feet, I announced myself ready for departure.</p>

<p class="indent">When I appeared before the grand vizier, he said,
"<i>Mashallah!</i> By the beard of the king, thou art a good servant;
the kingdom of the Francs, however, is not falling quite so rapidly
that we cannot wait for a fortunate hour for your departure."</p>

<p class="indent">I had entirely resigned myself to fate, and therefore
said, "Whatever the Shah commands, I am ready to obey." Taking
advantage of the presence of many persons who were come
to attend the vizier's levee; and perhaps as much to exhibit
my own consequence as to ask a question of importance, I
stept forward, and, kneeling before him, applied my mouth to
his ear, and said, "Your slave was anxious to have one question
answered, before he went, which is this:&mdash;suppose, before he
got to England, its king were really deposed, and the new king,
the People Shah, had mounted on the throne, what is your slave to do?"</p>

<p class="indent">At this the vizier paused, and, reflecting a while, said,
"You will then live in a corner, and write to us for instructions; but
do not lose any opportunity of making good hits in penknives,
broad-cloth, and virgins."</p>

<p class="indent">Having waited his pleasure for some time, he then
announced that he would take me before the Shah; and accordingly we
proceeded thither, he taking the lead, whilst I followed at a
respectable distance.</p>

<p class="indent">The king was in a good humour; in other words, his
brain was sane, and his spirits well wound up. "By the head of the
Shah!" he exclaimed, as soon as he saw me equipped for the
journey, "the Hajji is a wonderful man; he makes as little of
going from here to Frangistan, as we do of going from the imperial
gate to the Takht Kajar."</p>

<p class="indent">Upon this the grand vizier said, "As I am your sacrifice,
we are all your slaves, we are all your servants,
we are all ready to go to Frangistan."</p>

<p class="indent">"That is well," said the Shah.
"Is every thing prepared for the Hajji?"</p>

<p class="indent">"As I am your sacrifice, yes;" answered the minister.
Upon which he drew from his girdle a roll of paper, which contained
the instructions I was to receive as the rule of my conduct,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
and the several official letters which I was to deliver upon
my arrival in England.</p>

<p class="indent">They were exhibited; and, the proper seals having been
placed in the royal presence, they were sent to the head mastofi, or
secretary, to be directed, and inserted in their silken bags.</p>

<p class="indent">When this was over, the king sent for a <i>calaat</i>, or
dress of honour, with which I was soon after invested; and then he announced
to me with his own sacred lips, (an event which in my younger
days I had so much desired,) that, if on my return I should have
fulfilled my mission to the Shah's satisfaction, the title of khan
would be conferred upon me, with an appropriate dress of honour.</p>

<p class="indent">This piece of intelligence, some ten years ago, would
have made my head touch the skies, but now it fell upon the surface
of my mind as lead upon cotton; for it promised rather more of
trouble than of that questionable sensation called honour, which
I had long learnt to despise.</p>

<p class="indent">I went to the <i>Der a Khoneh</i>, or the King's Gate,
to take leave of my friends, and there I received the papers relating
to my mission. I was instructed to offer no presents, but to receive
as many for the Shah as might be given; although, in the destitute
situation in which we supposed England was, we agreed
that we could not expect many. The chief treasurer then gave
me a bag of <i>tomans</i>, few in number, and which, I was aware, were
insufficient to defray my expenses there and back; yet, rather
than run the chance of having my ears clipped by asking for
more, I chose to trust to my own ingenuity, and to the knowledge
of <i>chum wa hum</i>, or palaver, which I possessed, to make
up the deficiencies. In short, I determined to travel at everybody's
cost rather than my own.</p>

<p class="indent">At night I went to kiss the hem of the grand vizier's
garment, and to receive his last orders before my departure. He said
nothing besides recommending me to the care of the Prophet,
and requesting me to send him some silk spangled stuffs for the
trousers of his harem when I reached Constantinople. I then received
the embrace of my old master, the Mirza Firooz, who furnished
me with letters to his old friends in England; and with
these consolations I went home, rolled up my carpets, ordered
my mule to be loaded, and my horses to be saddled; and, when
all was ready, I locked the door of my house, and, putting the
key in my pocket, I set off for the country of the Francs.</p>

<p class="indent">I reached Erzeroom without any difficulty, having become
a gainer, rather than a loser, by my journey, owing to the presents
which I extracted from the villages on the road, who made them
out of consideration to the character of <i>elchi</i>, or ambassador,
which I did not fail to assume. Having got to this city, I determined
to repose for a few days; and, in order to refresh my
memory upon the object of my mission, I passed my time in
reading over the instructions with which I had been furnished.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps my readers may be glad to know their contents.</p>

<p class="indent">They were as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 6em;">"<i>Instructions to the high in station, the Mirza Hajji Baba.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"That since, by the blessing of Allah, it has come to
the knowledge of the asylum of the universe, the king of kings, that
the good fortune which accompanied the infidels of England has
turned upon them, it has appeared good to appoint some master
of wit, some lord of understanding and experience, to go, and
see, and consider, and to endeavour to extract advantage from
misery, wealth from poverty, and instruction from wickedness:
to that effect, the high in station, Hajji Baba, famous for his skill
in Franc wisdom and language, the lord of accomplishment, the
skilled in cunning and intelligence, has been appointed to this service.</p>

<p class="indent">"That as in every country good men are to be found
among whole communities of bad, even as roses are seen to grow among
thorns and thistles, the Hajji will, with that eye of discernment
for which he is famous, discover such men among the infidels,
and learn from them the why and the wherefore, the how and
the when, and the truth, if such is to be found, of all that has
taken place; beginning with the beginning, and going on to the
present time; and marking the same in a book to be placed before
the all-refulgent presence of the shadow of God upon earth.</p>

<p class="indent">"That, as it is strictly enjoined in our blessed Koran,
written by the inspired Prophet, upon whom be blessings and peace!
that true believers do inflict all the harm in their power upon
infidels, even unto death, the Hajji is enjoined to take every
advantage in his power of their distress; taking their goods at
the smallest value; enticing their choice workmen into the land
of Iran; holding out premiums of calaats, and the protection of
the Shah to their wise men; and making it clear to them
that it is better to make the confession of faith in the religion of
Islam, than to persist in their own unclean belief; holding out
promises of protection and advancement to those who, of their
own free will, will shave their heads, let their beards grow,
receive the proper marks, and say, "<i>Laallah, illalah, Mohamed
resoul Allah!</i>" and assurances of toleration to those who through
obstinacy and infatuation still eat the unclean beast, drink wine,
and call Isau the only true prophet.</p>

<p class="indent">"That, upon arriving at the gate of the palace in London,
he will proceed to the presence of the king, brother to the ancient
friend and ally of Persia, if king he still be; and, after
having delivered the all-auspicious letter with which he is charged,
he will lift up his voice and say, 'O king, the asylum of the
universe, whose slave I am, has sent me to thee in thy distress,
to offer thee a seat at his gate, bread to eat, and the free usages
of thy own country.' The Hajji will then use his own discretion,
and his own tongue, according as circumstances may direct
his wisdom, to console the Franc king in his distress, to point out
to him the manner in which he will be received, and to hold out
the prospect of commanding the Shah's ship in the Caspian Sea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"That, having seen the king, he will repair to the
famous Franc general, celebrated for having discomfited the great French
conqueror, well known in Iran, and point out to him the advantages
of serving the Shah, instead of sitting in a corner under a
new king of his own people; and further, that he will place
before him the certainty of his being appointed to command the
Persian armies, who will not fail to take both Moscow and Petersburg,
to burn the fathers of the Russians, and thus to entitle
himself to such share of the pillage as the Shah in his greatness
will allow him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Having secured these advantages, the Hajji will then
cast his eyes about the country, and do his best endeavours to procure
for the harem of the Shah three choice virgins, whose
beauty must surpass everything that has been seen in Iran,
with figures like poplar-trees, waists a span round, eyes like
those of the antelope, faces round as the moon, hair to the
swell of the leg, throats so fine that the wine may be seen in
its passage through them, teeth like pearls, and breath like
the gales wafted from the caravans of musk from Khatai.
They are required to be mistresses of every accomplishment;
to sing so loud and so long that they may be heard from the
Ark to the Negaristan; to dance every dance, standing on their
heads, and running on their hands. They must embroider, sew,
and spin; they must know how to make <i>halwa</i>, or sweetmeats;
how to light a <i>kalioon</i>, or pipe, and to play the
<i>jerid bazi</i> on horseback. In short, they must unite all the
accomplishments of Fars to the sagacity of Francs; and should they
please the Shah, only for one hour, they will have the satisfaction
of having made the Hajji's face white for ever.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Shah, in his wisdom, trusting to the misery which
is now known to assail the English nation, enjoins the Hajji, as
he would gain the royal favour, and gain a great name in Iran,
ever to keep a watchful eye upon penknives, broad-cloth, chandeliers,
and looking-glasses. He will make as large a collection
as possible for the use of the Shah,&mdash;for nothing if he can: for
little if he cannot for nothing. He will also accumulate every
other desirable thing fitted for the use of the king, which may
come within his grasp.</p>

<p class="indent">"In short, he will recollect that such another opportunity
of acquiring advantages to his king and country as the breaking
up of a large nation and government, will never perhaps again
be afforded; and with this truth in his mind, that with one
grain of wisdom frequently more is to be achieved than with the
strength of armies, he will employ all his best wit to turn that
head to account which Allah in his mercy has given to him, and
which luck and the blessed Prophet has given to the asylum of
the universe to employ."</p>

<p class="indent">When I had read over my instructions, I laid the
head of confusion upon the pillow of repose, and sought in vain to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
relieve myself from the various strange images which they had
brought into my brain. I feared that it would be impossible
to bring the arduous business with which I was intrusted to
a happy conclusion, and secure for myself a white face at the
end of it, so difficult did it appear. However, the certainty that
<i>Allah kerim est</i>, or God is merciful, came to my help: and
with this soothing feeling, I quieted my apprehensions, and continued
my road to Constantinople, fully persuaded that, be the
true believer among Jews, Francs, or Muscovites, his only true
help is in <i>Allah</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="indent">I reached Constantinople, and immediately inquired
for the house of a Franc whom I had known in former days: an Englishman,
who might enlighten my understanding concerning the
objects of my mission, and might inform me what might be
the state of his country. He was a sensible man,&mdash;a man done
to a turn, who knew the difference between justice and injustice,
and whose words were not thrown into the air without use.
He frankly confirmed to me the truth of everything we had
heard reported at the gate of the asylum of the universe. I
found him seated on bales of merchandise in his warehouse,
looking as if the world had placed his heels where his head
ought to be, and desponding over his future prospects. Whatever
I said to him upon the unreasonableness of attempting to
strive against the decrees of Providence was of no avail. Instead
of sitting down satisfied with his <i>takdeer</i>, or fate, as I should
have done, I found him poring over a large sheet of Franc
paper, printed, and therefore true, which he had just received
from his own land, and cursing in his teeth one of his household
demons, as I thought, which he called "<i>Dowlet</i>." He said
that he verily believed the father of madness had taken possession
of his once flourishing country; for what was always looked
upon as right, was now called wrong, and what used to be execrated
as wrong was now adopted as right. And, moreover, he
asserted that the infatuation had gone so far, that nobody
seemed inclined to eat his figs, no one would buy his cotton:
there was an universal cry upon the miseries entailed by silk,
and more gloves now existed in the world than there were
hands to wear them. If such were the miseries of silk, thought
I,&mdash;a produce which comes from abroad,&mdash;what must be
those of penknives which grow in the country? I kept my thoughts
to myself, and determined to set off without delay to put my
orders into execution. There was one thing I was glad to
ascertain in the interview with my friend, which was, that I
had not so entirely forgotten his language as I had feared,
and that I understood much of what he said. When I saw that
large printed sheet of paper, numerous were the recollections
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
it gave rise to, and I was struck with apprehension lest my
thoughts, words, actions, even to the dye of my beard, would
be carefully registered therein day by day, the moment I set
my foot on English ground, if I did not take great precautions
against such an evil. I therefore determined to keep myself as
much unknown as possible; and, to that effect, resolved to
leave Constantinople without seeing the ambassador of the King
of England, who was residing there; and to make my way to
the foot of his king's throne with all the best haste I could.</p>

<p class="indent">In consequence of what I had heard from the Franc
merchant, and from all I had seen with my own eyes, I collected all
my certainty into a heap, and became quite satisfied that the
madness for which all Francs are celebrated, and particularly the
English, was now beginning to be fully developed, and, strange
to say, that the Turks, a nation so unchanged since the days of
Seljuk, so fixed in <i>destour</i>, or custom, tied down by ancient
habit,&mdash;the Turks themselves were no longer the same; the English
disorder, Reform, had crept in amongst them, and had committed
woful ravages. The Sultan himself took the lead; and it
was now a question solemnly discussed among the elders and ulemah,
whether heaven had come down to earth amongst them,
or whether earth had descended into hell. Some asserted one
thing, some another. Those who were for heaven said, "Thank
Allah, our souls are now becoming as free as our chins. Where
are now those odious beards that used to wave about the ends
of our faces like long grass on the mountain top; that took toll
of every mouthful of food that went into our mouths; that required
more washing and dyeing than a Franc's shirt; and that
gave a handle to our enemies without being of use to ourselves&mdash;where
are they? Swept for ever from the faces of the sons
of Islam, and swimming through the currents of the Bosphorus
and the Dardanelles. And where are now those great, those
awful, those capacious breeches, that could include within their
folds as many legs as would serve a whole company of soldiers, instead
of one pair of legs, which were eternally playing at hide-and-seek
among their immense involutions? They are gone for ever.
The saving to the Bab Homaioon&mdash;the gate of splendour&mdash;and
to the treasury of the great blood-drinker, in broad-cloth alone,
will be worth ten thousand fighting men per annum, let alone
the inconvenience to the individuals. And because we change
the fashion of our clothes, does it follow that we change that of
our faith, as our enemies would have us to do? No. We
can kneel down on our praying-carpets as often and as easily
in our tights, as we before did in our slacks. And although
smooth chins may be common to unbelievers, yet it is certain
that the paradise of Mahomet is as open to the shaved as it is to
the hairy."</p>

<p class="indent">On the other hand, those who were of the Jehanum faction
insisted that the whole dignity and consequence of the Turkish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
empire had been sacrificed with the beards of its subjects; that,
from looking a nation of sages, they had been turned into a nation
of monkeys; and that although the rage of innovation had
hitherto only seized the capital, yet, so it was once argued, when
once it was known in the provinces that its emperor, the vicegerent
of Allah upon earth, had cut off his beard, it was likely
that the whole of the population would do so likewise, and
thus universal degradation would ensue.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, as for the tight trousers which had been
introduced, what lover of decency would now venture to show his person
in the nakedness of unprotected legs, like the unblushing Francs?
People might revile the janissaries; but, at all events, they were
decently clad men, wearing as much cloth and muslin about
their dress as would clothe a whole orta of the poor starving-looking
individuals of the new nizam. It might be very well to
say, that the faith of the heart did not change with the cut of
one's clothes; but it was plain that when once reform began, it
was impossible to say where it might stop; and true Mussulmans
might perhaps soon have to deplore its terrible effects, by
seeing their wives walk about without veils, with their faces exposed
to the gaze of man. The unclean beast would ere long be
eaten with impunity from one end of the celestial empire to the
other; whilst all the holy Prophet's injunctions against wine
would be entirely set at nought;&mdash;all to follow the example of
unclean, faithless, and corrupt Francs, upon whom be all curses
poured!</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Such were the subjects which I daily heard
discussed among the Turks, and every word which entered into my ears, only
confirmed the reports which had reached my own country. I
therefore consulted with my friend the Franc merchant upon
the easiest mode of getting to England, quickest in point of
conveyance, and the most eligible in point of secrecy. He recommended
me to go by land, and first to proceed to the capital
of the Nemseh, or Germans, ascending the Balkan, descending
into the plains of Wallachia, by first crossing the Danube, and
then making my way to another chain of mountains culled Karpathos;
which having crossed, I should soon find myself among
the Majar, and then all in good time, meeting the Danube again,
I should reach Vienna. This seemed mighty easy to the Franc
merchant, but to me it appeared very much like scaling the six
heavens to get at the seventh. However, I was on the Shah's
business; and therefore, putting my firm faith in Allah, I allied
myself with a party of Greek merchants, who were proceeding
into Germany upon matters of business. We resolved to set
off as soon as we should hear that no recent robberies had taken
place on the road.

<h2>SONNET TO A FOG.</h2>
<p class="center">(WITH A CRITICAL NOTE.)</p>

<span class="i10">But, d&mdash;n their eyes! Old England for my money."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">"And do you call this a sonnet, sir?" I hear some reader
say, with his fingers resting on the twentieth line: "I hope I know what a
sonnet is; why, sir, sonnet is the Greek for <i>fourteen</i>, to be
sure; and your lines must always count just two over the dozen, or
you make no sonnet of it; everybody knows this same."</p>

<p class="indent">Have patience, good reader, while I proceed to convict
thee of impertinence. No man is so happy of an occasion of correcting others
as he who has recently learnt something. Now, behold! I have recently
learnt this,&mdash;that the Italian poets, when they want to be
funny, and at the same time to sonnetteer, (new verb,) outrage the
gentle proportions of Poetry's fairest daughter&mdash;her whose delicate
form took captive the soul of Petrarch&mdash;by ignominiously affixing to
her hinder parts that always unseemly appendage&mdash;<i>a tail</i>, which is
no less a tail, and therefore no less disgraceful to her who wears it,
for being called, in the more courtly language of those original conspirators,
<i>coda</i> (from Latin <i>cauda</i>, observe;&mdash;see your dictionary.)
This have I learnt, astonished reader, by poking into the <i>Parnasso
Italiano</i>, as you may do, and there, beholding these prodigious baboon
sonnets in full tail,&mdash;for verily they resemble not the true birth
more than monkeys resemble men, and that is as much as to say
they do resemble them&mdash;in such a manner as to make you laugh at
the difference. But herein those Italian conspirators, who hatched
the infernal plot, gained their end; they diverted their readers at the
expense of poetical decency. Now, however, seeing that this second
("<i>caudatus</i>") species of the sonnet has a real and lively existence in
the land that gave it birth; and seeing that we have freely imported
from that land the other, the <i>non-caudatus</i>, species, (for I suppose all
young ladies and gentlemen know to what country they are indebted
for the fourteen-lined happiness,) it seems but fair that we should
improve our national stock by bringing over the later breed, and applying
it to the same uses as our neighbours.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The above is the first avowed specimen of the <i>tailed sonnet</i>,
I believe, that has ever appeared in English; and I hope it may operate
as a useful example to better poets, and induce them to clap tails
continually to their sonnets, whenever they intend fun.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
I say it is the first <i>avowed</i> specimen, because there exists one
(unsuspected) among the poems of no less a man than John Milton, who found
nothing admirable in any language but he quickly transplanted it. That
most accomplished of modern poetical critics, Leigh Hunt, was the
first who discovered the fact, and gave the alarm to Milton's editors;
he showed very clearly that that short poem, "On the New Forcers of
conscience under the Long Parliament," which is always published,
ignorantly, among the <i>miscellaneous</i> pieces, is neither more nor less
than a comic <i>sonnet</i> with the Italian tail to it. If the reader will
take the trouble to look into his Milton, he will find that this poem
down to the line,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6em;">"Your plots and packing worse than those of Trent,"</p>

<p>forms a regular fourteen-liner; then comes the little adjunct,&mdash;"That
so the parliament,"&mdash;which, rhyming with the foregoing, gains the
right of introducing a new couplet; then another, rhyming with that,
and lending to a second supernumerary. In this manner the Italian
poets link on couplet after couplet without end, and you may see
some of their sonnets with tails stretching through several pages;
nay, for aught I know, you might have a sonnet in two volumes
octavo, without exceeding your licence. But it must always be constructed
on the above plan, with links of a like thickness. By the bye,
it is surprising that the late editors of Milton's poems&mdash;men professedly
conversant with Italian literature&mdash;should still persist in placing
this comic sonnet among the "miscellaneous pieces," after the error
has been pointed out to them!</p>

<p class="indent">As for the question&mdash;why a tail should be ridiculous?&mdash;it
seems to me one of considerable intricacy, and of the highest interest. Yes,
Mr. Editor, why <i>should</i> tails be ridiculous? Coat-tails, pig-tails,
all tails whatsoever, are found to touch us with a sense of the jocose;
nay, your comet's tail itself is only a kind of <i>terrific absurdity</i>.
I say, therefore, without fear of contradiction, that there subsists in
this question a deep psychological truth, which demands the exploring
hand of philosophy; and if no better man will take the hint,&mdash;why, Mr.
Editor, I think I must myself present you, another time, with my
ideas on this subject, handling the matter in the Aristotelian mode,
and dividing my <i>tails</i> into <i>heads</i>.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">With respect to the tail of a comic sonnet, it
may be briefly remarked, that its comicality (of course I speak with reference
to the Italian models) arises in a great measure from the stumbling of the
little line, which always comes limping after the long one, as if something
were forgotten to be said in it, which the little one thus breathlessly
comes to adjoin; and then a succession of these <i>quasi</i> oversights
makes us laugh, alternately at the seeming blunder and at the funny
haste with which it is redressed. Or it is like an orator in his cups,
speaking fairly enough his <i>prepared</i> speech; but then&mdash;encouraged by
applause&mdash;spoiling all with drunken additions <i>ex tempore</i>.

<h2>HANDY ANDY.&mdash;No. III.</h2>

<p class="indent">Squire Egan was as good as his word. He picked out
the most suitable horsewhip for chastising the fancied impertinence of
Murtough Murphy; and as he switched it up and down with a powerful
arm, to try its weight and pliancy, the whistling of the instrument
through the air was music to his ears, and whispered of promised joy
in the flagellation of the jocular attorney.</p>

<p class="indent">"We'll see who can make the sorest blister," said the
squire. "I'll back whalebone against Spanish flies any day. Will you bet,
Dick?" said he to his brother-in-law, who was a wild helter-skelter
sort of fellow, better known over the country as Dick the Devil than
Dick Dawson.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll back your bet, Ned."</p>

<p class="indent">"There's no fun in that, Dick, as there is nobody to take it up."</p>

<p class="indent">"Maybe Murtough will. Ask him before you thrash him; you'd better."</p>

<p class="indent">"As for <i>him</i>," said the squire, "I'll be bound he'll back
my bet after he gets a taste o' this;" and the horsewhip whistled as he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">"I think he had better take care of his back than his bet,"
said Dick, as he followed the squire to the hall-door, where his horse was
in waiting for him, under the care of the renowned Andy, who little dreamed
the extensive harvest of mischief which was ripening in futurity, all from his sowing.</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't kill him quite, Ned," said Dick, as the squire mounted to his saddle.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, if I went to horsewhip a gentleman, of course I
should only shake my whip at him; but an attorney is another affair. And, as
I'm sure he'll have an action against me for assault, I think I may as
well get the worth o' my money out of him, to say nothing of
teaching him better manners for the future than to play off his jokes
on his employers." With these words, off he rode in search of the
devoted Murtough, who was not at home when the squire reached
his house; but, as he was returning through the village, he espied
him coming down the street in company with Tom Durfy and the
widow, who were laughing heartily at some joke Murtough was telling
them, which seemed to amuse him as much as his hearers.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll make him laugh at the wrong side of his mouth," thought
the squire, alighting and giving his horse to the care of one of the little
ragged boys who were idling in the street. He approached Murphy
with a very threatening aspect, and, confronting him and his party so
as to produce a halt, he said, as distinctly as his rage would permit
him to speak, "You little insignificant blackguard, I'll teach you
how you'll cut your jokes on <i>me</i> again; <i>I'll</i> blister you,
my buck!" and, laying hands on the astonished Murtough with the last
word, he began a very smart horsewhipping of the attorney. The widow
screamed, Tom Durfy swore, and Murtough roared, with some interjectional
curses. At last he escaped from the squire's grip, leaving
the lappel of his coat in his possession; and Tom Durfy interposed his
person between them when he saw an intention on the part of the
flagellator to repeat his dose of horsewhip.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Let me at him, sir; or by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Fie, fie, squire&mdash;to horsewhip a gentleman like a cart-horse."</p>

<p class="indent">"A gentleman!&mdash;an attorney you mean."</p>

<p class="indent">"I say a gentleman, Squire Egan," cried Murtough fiercely,
roused to gallantry by the presence of a lady, and smarting under a sense of
injury and whalebone. "I'm a gentleman, sir, and demand the
satisfaction of a gentleman. I put my honour in your hands, Mr. Durfy."</p>

<p class="indent">"Between his finger and thumb you mean, for there's not a
handful of it," said the squire.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, sir," replied Tom Durfy, "little or much, I'll take charge
of it.&mdash;That's right, my cock," said he to Murtough, who, notwithstanding
his desire to assume a warlike air, could not resist the natural
impulse of rubbing his back and shoulders, which tingled with
pain, while he exclaimed "Satisfaction! satisfaction!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well," said the squire: "you name yourself as Mr. Murphy's
friend?" added he to Durfy.</p>

<p class="indent">"The same, sir," said Tom. "Who do you name as yours?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I suppose you know one Dick the Divil."</p>

<p class="indent">"A very proper person, sir;&mdash;no better:
I'll go to him directly."</p>

<p class="indent">The widow clung to Tom's arm, and, looking tenderly at him,
cried "Oh, Tom, Tom, take care of your precious life!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Bother!" said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, Squire Egan, don't be so bloodthirsty!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Fudge, woman!" said the squire.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, Mr. Murphy, I'm sure the squire's very sorry
for beating you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Divil a bit," said the squire.</p>

<p class="indent">"There, ma'am," said Murphy; "you see he'll make no apology."</p>

<p class="indent">"Apology!" said Durfy;&mdash;"apology for a horsewhipping,
indeed!&mdash;Nothing but handing a horsewhip (which I wouldn't ask any
gentleman to do), or a shot can settle the matter."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Tom! Tom! Tom!" said the widow.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ba! ba! ba!" shouted Tom, making a crying face at her.
"Arrah, woman, don't be makin' a fool o' yourself. Go in there to the
'pothecary's, and get something under your nose to revive you; and
let <i>us</i> mind <i>our</i> business."</p>

<p class="indent">The widow, with her eyes turned up, and an exclamation
to Heaven, was retiring to M'Garry's shop wringing her hands, when she
was nearly knocked down by M'Garry himself, who rushed from his
own door, at the same moment that an awful smash of his shop-window,
and the demolition of his blue and red bottles, alarmed the ears
of the bystanders, while their eyes were drawn from the late belligerent
parties to a chase which took place down the street, of the apothecary
roaring "Murder!" followed by Squire O'Grady with an enormous cudgel.</p>

<p class="indent">O'Grady, believing that M'Garry and the nurse-tender had
combined to serve him with a writ, determined to wreak double vengeance
on the apothecary, as the nurse had escaped him; and, notwithstanding
all the appeals of his poor frightened wife, he left his bed, and
rode to the village to "break every bone in M'Garry's skin." When
he entered the shop, the pharmacopolist was much surprised, and
said, with a congratulatory grin at the great man, "Dear me, Squire
O'Grady, I'm delighted to see you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Are you, you scoundrel!" said the squire, making a blow
of his cudgel at him, which was fended by an iron pestle the apothecary
fortunately had in his hand. The enraged O'Grady made a rush
behind the counter, which the apothecary nimbly jumped over, crying
"Murder!" as he made for the door, followed by his pursuer,
who gave a back-handed slap at the window-bottles <i>en passant</i>, and
produced the crash which astonished the widow, who now joined her
screams to the general hue-and-cry; for an indiscriminate chase of
all the ragamuffins in the town, with barking curs and screeching
children, followed the flight of M'Garry and the pursuing squire.</p>

<p class="indent">"What the divil is all this about?" said Tom Durfy, laughing.
"By the powers! I suppose there's something in the weather to produce
all this fun,&mdash;though it's early in the year yet to begin thrashing,
for the harvest isn't in yet. But, however, let us manage our
little affair, now that we're left in peace and quietness, for the
blackguards are all over the bridge afther the hunt. I'll go to Dick the
Divil immediately, squire, and arrange time and place."</p>

<p class="indent">"There's nothing like saving time and trouble on these
occasions," said the squire. "Dick is at my house, I can arrange time and
place with you this minute, and he will be on the ground with me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well," said Tom; "where is it to be?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Suppose we say the cross-roads halfway between this and
Merryvale. There's very pretty ground there, and we shall be able
to get our pistols, and all that, ready in the mean time between this
and four o'clock,&mdash;and it will be pleasanter to have it all
over before dinner."</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly, squire," said Tom Durfy; "we'll be there at
four.&mdash;Till then, good morning, squire;" and he and his man walked off;
Tom having left the widow under the care of the apothecary's boy, who
was applying asaf&oelig;tida and other sweet-smelling things to the
alleviation of the faintings which the widow thought it proper and
delicate to enact on the occasion.</p>

<p class="indent">The squire rode immediately homewards, and told
Dick Dawson the piece of work that was before them.</p>

<p class="indent">"And so he'll have a shot at you, instead of an action,"
said Dick. "Well, there's pluck in that: I wish he was more of a gentleman
for your sake. It's dirty work shooting attorneys."</p>

<p class="indent">"He's enough of a gentleman, Dick, to make it impossible
for me to refuse him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly, Ned," said Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you know is he anything of a shot?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Faith, he makes very pretty snipe-shooting; but I don't
know if he has experience of the grass before breakfast."</p>

<p class="indent">"You must try and find out from any one on the ground; because,
if the poor divil isn't a good shot, I wouldn't like to kill him, and
I'll let him off easy&mdash;I'll give it to him in the pistol-arm, or so."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well, Ned. Where are the flutes? I must look over them."</p>

<p class="indent">"Here," said the squire, producing a very handsome mahogany
case of Rigby's best. Dick opened the case with the utmost care,
and took up one of the pistols tenderly, handling it as delicately as if
it were a young child or a lady's hand. He clicked the lock back
and forwards a few times; and, his ear not being satisfied at the music
it produced, he said he should like to examine them: "At all events,
they want a touch of oil."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Well, keep them out of the misthriss's sight, Dick, for
she might be alarmed."</p>

<p class="indent">"Divil a taste," says Dick; "she's a Dawson, and there
never was a Dawson yet that did not know men must be men."</p>

<p class="indent">"That's true, Dick. I wouldn't mind so much if she wasn't
in a delicate situation just now, when it couldn't be expected of the woman
to be so stout: so go, like a good fellow, into your own room,
and Andy will bring you anything you want."</p>

<p class="indent">Five minutes after, Dick was engaged in cleaning the
duelling-pistols, and Andy at his elbow, with his mouth wide open, wondering at
the interior of the locks which Dick had just taken off.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, my heavens! but that's a quare thing, Misther Dick, sir,"
said Andy, going to take it up.</p>

<p class="indent">"Keep your fingers off it, you thief, do!" roared Dick, making a
rap of the turnscrew at Andy's knuckles.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sure I'll save you the throuble o' rubbin' that, Misther Dick,
if you let me; here's the shabby leather."</p>

<p class="indent">"I wouldn't let your clumsy fist near it, Andy, nor your
<i>shabby</i> leather, you villain, for the world. Go get me some oil."</p>

<p class="indent">Andy went on his errand, and returned with a can of
lamp-oil to Dick, who swore at him for his stupidity: "The divil fly away
with you; you never do anything right; you bring me lamp-oil for a pistol."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, sure I thought lamp-oil was the right thing for burnin'."</p>

<p class="indent">"And who wants to burn it, you savage?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Aren't you goin' to fire it, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Choke you, you vagabond!" said Dick, who could not resist
laughing, nevertheless; "be off, and get me some sweet oil, but don't
tell any one what it's for."</p>

<p class="indent">Andy retired, and Dick pursued his polishing of the locks.
Why he used such a blundering fellow as Andy for a messenger might be
wondered at, only that Dick was fond of fun, and Andy's mistakes
were a particular source of amusement to him, and on all occasions
when he could have Andy in his company he made him his attendant.
When the sweet oil was produced, Dick looked about for a feather;
but, not finding one, desired Andy to fetch him a pen. Andy
went on his errand, and returned, after some delay, with an ink-bottle.</p>

<p class="indent">"I brought you the ink, sir, but I can't find a pin."</p>

<p class="indent">"Confound your numskull! I didn't say a word about ink;
I asked for a pen."</p>

<p class="indent">"And what use would a pin be without ink, now I ax yourself,
Misther Dick?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'd knock your brains out if you had any, you <i>omadhaun</i>!
Go along and get me a feather, and make haste."</p>

<p class="indent">Andy went off, and, having obtained a feather, returned to Dick,
who began to tip certain portions of the lock very delicately with oil.</p>

<p class="indent">"What's that for, Misther Dick, sir, if you plaze?"</p>

<p class="indent">"To make it work smooth."</p>

<p class="indent">"And what's that thing you're grazin' now, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That's the tumbler."</p>

<p class="indent">"O Lord! a tumbler&mdash;what a quare name for it.
I thought there was no tumbler but a tumbler for punch."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"That's the tumbler you would like to be cleaning
the inside of, Andy."</p>

<p class="indent">"Thrue for you, sir.&mdash;And what's that little thing you
have your hand on now, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That's the cock."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh dear, a cock!&mdash;Is there e'er a hin in it, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, nor a chicken either, though there <i>is</i> a feather."</p>

<p class="indent">"The one in your hand, sir, that you're grazin' it with."</p>

<p class="indent">"No: but this little thing&mdash;this is called the feather-spring."</p>

<p class="indent">"It's the feather, I suppose, makes it let fly."</p>

<p class="indent">"No doubt of it, Andy."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, there's some sinse in that name, then; but who'd
think of sitch a thing as a tumbler and a cock in a pistle? And what's that
place that opens and shuts, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The pan."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, there's sinse in that name too, bekaze there's fire in
the thing; and it's as nath'ral to say pan to that as to a fryin'-pan&mdash;isn't
it, Misther Dick?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! there was a great gunmaker lost in you, Andy," said
Dick, as he screwed on the locks, which he had regulated to his mind, and
began to examine the various departments of the pistol-case, to see
that it was properly provided. He took the instrument to cut some circles of
thin leather, and Andy again asked him for the name "o' <i>that</i> thing."</p>

<p class="indent">"This is called the punch, Andy."</p>

<p class="indent">"So, there <i>is</i> the punch as well as the tumbler, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, and very strong punch it is, you see, Andy;" and
Dick struck it with his little mahogany mallet, and cut his patches of leather.</p>

<p class="indent">"And what's that for, sir?&mdash;the leather, I mane."</p>

<p class="indent">"That's for putting round the ball."</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it for fear 'twould hurt him too much when you hot him?"</p>

<p class="indent">"You're a queer customer, Andy," said Dick, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">"And what weeshee little balls thim is, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"They are always small for duelling-pistols."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, then <i>thim</i> is jewellin' pistles. Why, musha,
Misther Dick, is it goin' to fight a jule you are?" said Andy, looking at
him with earnestness.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, Andy,&mdash;but the master is;
but don't say a word about it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not a word for the world. The masther goin' to fight!&mdash;God
send him safe out iv it!&mdash;Amin. And who is he going to fight, Misther Dick?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Murphy the attorney, Andy."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, won't the masther disgrace himself by fightin' the 'torney?"</p>

<p class="indent">"How dare you say such a thing of your master?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I ax your pard'n, Misther Dick; but sure you know
what I mane.&mdash;I hope he'll shoot him."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, Andy, Murtough was always very good to you, and now
you wish him to be shot."</p>

<p class="indent">"Sure, why wouldn't I rather have him kilt more than the masther?"</p>

<p class="indent">"But neither may be killed."</p>

<p class="indent">"Misther Dick," said Andy, lowering his voice, "wouldn't it be an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
iligant thing to put two balls into the pistle instid o' one, and give
the masther a chance over the 'torney?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you murdherous villain!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Arrah, why shouldn't the masther have a chance over him? sure
he has childre, and 'Torney Murphy has none."</p>

<p class="indent">"At that rate, Andy, I suppose you'd give the master a
ball additional for every child he has, and that would make eight. So, you
might as well give him a blunderbuss and slugs at once."</p>

<p class="indent">Dick locked the pistol-case, having made all right; and
desired Andy to mount a horse, carry it by a back road out of the domain,
and wait at a certain gate he named until he should be joined
there by himself and the squire, who proceeded at the appointed time
to the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">Andy was all ready, and followed his master and Dick
with great pride, bearing the pistol-case after them to the ground, where
Murphy and Tom Durfy were ready to receive them, and a great
number of spectators were assembled; for the noise of the business
had gone abroad, and the ground was in consequence crowded.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom Durfy had warned Murtough Murphy, who had no experience
as a pistol-man, that the squire was a capital shot, and that his only
chance was to fire as quickly as he could.&mdash;"Slap at him, Morty, my
boy, the minute you get the word; and, if you don't hit him itself, it
will prevent his dwelling on his aim."</p>

<p class="indent">Tom Durfy and Dick the Devil soon settled the preliminaries
of the ground and mode of firing; and twelve paces having been marked,
both the seconds opened their pistol-cases, and prepared to load.
Andy was close to Dick all the time, kneeling beside the pistol-case,
which lay on the sod; and, as Dick turned round to settle some other
point on which Tom Durfy questioned him, Andy thought he might
snatch the opportunity of giving his master "the chance" he suggested
to his second.&mdash;"Sure, if Misther Dick wouldn't like to do it,
that's no raison I wouldn't," said Andy to himself; "and, by the
powers! I'll pop in a ball <i>onknownst</i> to him." And, sure enough,
Andy contrived, while the seconds were engaged with each other, to put a
ball into each pistol before the barrel was loaded with powder, so that,
when Dick took up his pistols to load, a bullet lay between the powder
and the touch-hole. Now this must have been discovered by
Dick, had he been cool; but he and Tom Durfy had wrangled very
much about the point they had been discussing, and Dick, at no time
the quietest person in the world, was in such a rage, that the pistols
were loaded by him without noticing Andy's ingenious interference,
and he handed a harmless weapon to his brother-in-law when he
placed him on his ground.</p>

<p class="indent">The word was given. Murtough, following his friend's advice,
fired instantly: bang he went, while the squire returned but a flash in the
pan. He turned a look of reproach upon Dick, who took the pistol
silently from him, and handed him the other, having carefully looked
to the priming, after the accident which happened to the first.</p>

<p class="indent">Durfy handed his man another pistol also; and, before he
left his side, said in a whisper, "Don't forget; have the first fire."</p>

<p class="indent">Again the word was given: Murphy blazed away a rapid
and harmless shot; for his hurry was the squire's safety, while Andy's
murderous intentions were his salvation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"D&mdash;n the pistol!" said the squire, throwing it down in
a rage. Dick took it up with manifest indignation, and d&mdash;d the powder.</p>

<p class="indent">"Your powder's damp, Ned."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, it's not," said the squire;
"it's you who have bungled the loading."</p>

<p class="indent">"Me!" said Dick, with a look of mingled rage and astonishment:
"<i>I</i> bungle the loading of pistols!&mdash;<i>I</i> that have stepped more
ground and arranged more affairs than any man in the
county!&mdash;Arrah, be aisy, Ned!"</p>

<p class="indent">Tom Durfy now interfered, and said, for the present it
was no matter, as, on the part of his friend, he begged to express himself satisfied.</p>

<p class="indent">"But it's very hard we're not to have a shot," said Dick,
poking the touch-hole of the pistol with a pricker which he had just taken
from the case which Andy was holding before him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, my dear Dick," said Durfy, "as Murphy has had two
shots, and the squire has not had the return of either, he declares he will
not fire at him again; and, under these circumstances, I must take
my man off the ground."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well," said Dick, still poking the touch-hole,
and examining the point of the pricker as he withdrew it.</p>

<p class="indent">"And now Murphy wants to know, since the affair is all
over and his honour satisfied, what was your brother-in-law's motive in
assaulting him this morning, for he himself cannot conceive a cause for it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, be <i>aisy</i>, Tom."</p>

<p class="indent">"'Pon my soul, it's true."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, he sent him a blister,&mdash;a regular apothecary's blister,&mdash;instead
of some law-process, by way of a joke, and Ned wouldn't stand it."</p>

<p class="indent">Durfy held a moment's conversation with Murphy, who
now advanced to the squire, and begged to assure him there must be some
mistake in the business, for that he had never committed the
impertinence of which he was accused.</p>

<p class="indent">"All I know is," said the squire, "that I got a blister, which my
messenger said you gave him."</p>

<p class="indent">"By virtue of my oath, squire, I never did it! I gave Andy an
enclosure of the law-process."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then it's some mistake that vagabond has made," said
the squire. "Come here, you sir!" he shouted to Andy, who was trembling
under the angry eye of Dick the Devil, who, having detected a bit of
lead on the point of the pricker, guessed in a moment Andy had
been at work; and the unfortunate rascal had a misgiving that he had
made some blunder, from the furious look of Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why don't you come here when I call you?" said the squire.&mdash;Andy
laid down the pistol-case, and sneaked up to the squire.&mdash;"What
did you do with the letter Mr. Murphy gave you for me yesterday?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I brought it to your honour."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, you didn't," said Murphy. "You've made some mistake."</p>

<p class="indent">"Divil a mistake I made," answered Andy very stoutly; "I wint
home the minit you give it to me."</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you go home direct from my house to the squire's?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Yis, sir, I did: I wint direct home, and called at Mr. M'Garry's
by the way for some physic for the childre."</p>

<p class="indent">"That's it!" said Murtough; "he changed my enclosure for a
blister there; and if M'Garry has only had the luck to send the bit o'
parchment to O'Grady, it will be the best joke I've heard this month
of Sundays."</p>

<p class="indent">"He did! he did!" shouted Tom Durfy; "for don't you remember
how O'Grady was after M'Garry this morning."</p>

<p class="indent">"Sure enough," said Murtough, enjoying the double mistake.
"By dad! Andy, you've made a mistake this time that I'll forgive you."</p>

<p class="indent">"By the powers o' war!" roared Dick the Devil, "I won't
forgive him what he did now, though! What do you think?" said he, holding
out the pistols, and growing crimson with rage: "may I never
fire another shot if he hasn't crammed a brace of bullets down the
pistols before I loaded them: so, no wonder you burned prime, Ned."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a universal laugh at Dick's expense, whose pride
in being considered the most accomplished regulator of the duello was well known.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Dick, Dick! you're a pretty second!" was shouted by all.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick, stung by the laughter, and feeling keenly the ridiculous
position in which he was placed, made a rush at Andy, who, seeing the
storm brewing, gradually sneaked away from the group, and, when he
perceived the sudden movement of Dick the Devil, took to his heels,
with Dick after him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hurra!" cried Murphy; "a race&mdash;a race! I'll bet
on Andy&mdash;five pounds on Andy."</p>

<p class="indent">"Done!" said the squire; "I'll back Dick the Divil."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tare an' ouns!" roared Murphy;
"how Andy runs! Fear's a fine spur."</p>

<p class="indent">"So is rage," said the squire. "Dick's hot-foot after him.
Will you double the bet?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Done!" said Murphy.</p>

<p class="indent">The infection of betting caught the bystanders, and various
gages were thrown down and taken up upon the speed of the runners, who
were getting rapidly into the distance, flying over hedge and ditch
with surprising velocity, and, from the level nature of the ground, an
extensive view could not be obtained; therefore Tom Durfy, the
steeple-chaser, cried "Mount, mount! or we'll lose the fun: into
our saddles, and after them!"</p>

<p class="indent">Those who had steeds took the hint, and a numerous field
of horsemen joined in the chase of Handy Andy and Dick the Devil, who
still maintained great speed. The horsemen made for a neighbouring
hill, whence they could command a wider view; and the betting
went on briskly, varying according to the vicissitudes of the race.</p>

<p class="indent">"Two to one on Dick&mdash;he's closing."</p>

<p class="indent">"Done!&mdash;Andy will wind him yet."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well done!&mdash;there's a leap! Hurra!&mdash;Dick's down!
Well done, Dick!&mdash;up again, and going."</p>

<p class="indent">"Mind the next quickset hedge&mdash;that's a rasper; it's a wide
gripe, and the hedge is as thick as a wall&mdash;Andy'll stick in it.&mdash;Mind
him!&mdash;Well leap'd, by the powers!&mdash;Ha! he's sticking in the
hedge&mdash;Dick'll catch him now.&mdash;No, by jingo! he has pushed his way
through&mdash;there he's going again at the other side.&mdash;Ha! ha! ha! ha!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
look at him&mdash;he's in tatthers!&mdash;he has left half of his breeches in the hedge."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dick is over now.&mdash;Hurra!&mdash;he has lost the
skirt of his coat&mdash;Andy is gaining on him.&mdash;Two to one on Andy!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Down he goes!" was shouted, as Andy's foot slipped in
making a dash at another ditch, into which he went head over heels, and Dick
followed fast, and disappeared after him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ride! ride!" shouted Tom Durfy, and the horsemen put their
spurs in the flanks of their steeds, and were soon up to the scene of
action. There was Andy roaring murder, rolling over and over in
the muddy bottom of a deep ditch, with Dick fastened on him, pummelling
away most unmercifully, but not able to kill him altogether
for want of breath.</p>

<p class="indent">The horsemen, in a universal <i>screech</i> of laughter,
dismounted, and disengaged the unfortunate Andy from the fangs of Dick the Devil,
who was dragged from out of the ditch much more like a scavenger than a gentleman.</p>

<p class="indent">The moment Andy got loose, away he ran again, and never cried
stop till he earthed himself under his mother's bed in the parent cabin.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The squire and Murtough Murphy shook hands,
and parted friends in half an hour after they had met as foes; end even Dick
contrived to forget his annoyance in an extra stoup of claret that day after
dinner,&mdash;filling more than one bumper in drinking <i>confusion</i>
to Handy Andy, which seemed a rather unnecessary malediction.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION TO THE BIOGRAPHY OF MY AUNT JEMIMA,<br />THE POLITICAL ECONOMIST.</h2>
<p class="f90">BY FRIDOLIN.</p>
<hr class="r5" />
<p class="f90 space-below2">PRELIMINARY DISQUISITION ON HUMAN GREATNESS,<br />
 TOUCHING UPON THE TRUE PHILOSOPHY OF THE MATTER.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Some men are born great,<br />&emsp;&emsp;some acquire greatness,<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and some have greatness thrust upon them."</p>

<p class="indent">Thus read my aunt Jemima, and thus subsequently read I, in the
days of our respective and respectable minorities; but with this difference&mdash;uncertain
whether <span class="smcap">Greatness</span> had not already clandestinely
made its <i>avatar</i> into me at my birth, or whether it was destined hereafter
to yield coyly to my wooing, or would force me in future years to
cry in vain humility, "<i>Nolo magnificari</i>." I always felt confident of eminence;
whereas my aunt Jemima often feelingly reverted to the misery
of her young maidenly thoughts, when brooding over the certainty
that she could never, under any circumstances, become a
"great man."</p>

<p class="indent">"Great women" were unknown in her early days. There were no
such things; save and except such as might be seen at St. Bartholomew's
fair at inexpensive cost,&mdash;giantesses, who lowered themselves
to gain a living by their height. But my aunt Jemima valued not
such feminine <i>greatness</i> as theirs. Her aspiring spirit looked not "to
<i>measures</i>, but to men." Our notions change!</p>

<p class="indent">It is very melancholy, and rather inconvenient, to drag
through the last and heaviest stage of life a martyr to a marvel.</p>

<p class="indent">Horace, who forbids all wise men to wonder, himself exhibited
a thriftless want of economy in the expenditure of his own wonder
when he marvelled, in excellent metre, that any man should eat garlic
who had not murdered his father; and also, that any mortal should
have dared to venture on the sea before the discovery of Kyan's
anti-dry-rot patent.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor can I much sympathise in the great marvel of that
renowned French statesman, of esculent memory, who professed himself unable
to discover any principle in nature, or in philosophy, that could explain
how a certain Duke of Thuringia, passing through Strasburg on
a diplomatic mission, should not have stopped to dine, <i>en hâte, de foie
gras</i>. As for the "three, yea four," curious problems of olden time,
which consumed the wise king with their inexplicability, they are as
clear to modern apprehensions as plate-glass: nay, as my aunt Jemima
used to observe, in the days when glory and greatness had
come upon her,&mdash;"Thanks be praised!" (My aunt was a religious woman,
and guarded herself from profane expressions.)&mdash;"Thanks be
praised! owing to the enlightenment of the age in which we live,
even in those seven wonders of the world there is nothing so very
wonderful now." There can be no objection on my part to allow that
eclipses were pretty marvellous transactions as long as they occurred
in consequence of a bilious dragon needing a pill, and bolting the sun
to correct digestion; but ever since dragons have adopted a different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
treatment, and abandoned the solar bolus, this phenomenon has
subsided into one of common-place pretension. The age of wonders,
like the New Marriage-act, has passed.</p>

<p class="indent">But one wonder&mdash;single, solitary, omnipotent&mdash;oppresses
me. It is, that mankind, from ignorance of the meaning of true greatness, lay
themselves open to perpetual insult,&mdash;nay, court it. Do we not lie
down patiently as lambs, and bear impertinent biographies to be
thrust before our eyes of persons who are facetiously termed <i>great</i>?
Great! implying, in a paltry and indifferently disguised innuendo,
that you, the reader, are of course small,&mdash;stunted, as it were, in
intellectual growth,&mdash;an under-shrub,&mdash;a dwarf specimen. Without being
in any way consulted in a matter, or examined, or probed, to see
what stuff may be in you, it is taken for granted that the world has
already made its odious comparisons between your unobtrusive self
and its <span class="smcap">Great Man</span>; and that, with the promptness of a
police magistrate, it has summarily decided against you; that you, without
knowing it, have been weighed in the scales and found wanting;
have flown upwards as a feather, have kicked the beam, have moved
lighter than a balloon textured of gossamer and inflated with rarefied
essence of hydrogen: a very pretty and gratifying assumption!</p>

<p class="indent">Our primitive lessons in emulation generally consist,
in great part, in a series of these insults.</p>

<p class="indent">The chubby little fellow, bribed to undergo the advantages
of scholarship by tardy permission to harass his young nether limbs
with trousers, usually of nankeen, finds himself immediately exhorted
to strive, in order that in time he may become a <span class="smcap">Great</span>
man. He images the vague outline of a human mammoth, and sits down with
scanty hope of modelling himself accordingly. In the pride and
pomp of baby ambition he yearns to rival in stature and girth the sons
of Amalek. He is small, and perfectly conscious that he is so; but
frets to exchange his little pulpy fingers for a sinewy fist that can
shake a weaver's beam: he meditates upon great men as pumpkins,
compared with which he is but a gooseberry. He is not taught, by
way of softening the injury done him by an unnecessary contrast,
that the one may be full of sweetness as the other of insipidity.</p>

<p class="indent">He waxes in years and amplitude: still hears he of that obtrusive
department in natural history, the <span class="smcap">Great</span> men. He thinks
not of them as before; he no longer deems their greatness to consist in
the mere admeasurement of their cubic contents, as in the days of his
young innocence, when an extensive pudding would, in his ceremonial,
have taken precedence of name and fame. He now understands,
and, by understanding, suffers the more acutely under the impertinence.
If acts of valour and command, or of senatorial display,&mdash;if a
tyranny over empires, or mighty influence over the minds and feelings
of successive generations,&mdash;if literary renown or public benefaction
constitute greatness, he is himself of most diminutive dimensions. He
knows it. He never for a moment dreamed of denying it. He has
enjoyed no scope for being otherwise. He is perfectly aware of the
fact, and would at once have admitted it. He needs not to have it
perpetually pushed into his face, and thrust before his eyes to glare
at him. The pauper feels that he is not one of the wealthy ones of
the earth, without being reminded at every instant of the incurious
circumstance by some rich bullionist shaking his pockets that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
wretch may hear the voice of the gold jingling. His memory requires
not to be so jogged on the subject. He recognises the truth of his
meagre estate, and derives not a whit of pleasure from such external
corroboration. It is an insult; and any raciness or merit of originality
in it is altogether lost upon him. The wit is purely thrown away.</p>

<p class="indent">How fares the boy when, like his primal sire, "he stands
erect a man?" and in what spirit does he study the philosophy of "greatness?"
He may bethink him of the false fruiterer's melon, how it
lay on the stall, its sunny side laughing and coquetting with the eye
of the wayfarer,&mdash;its rottenness and unsavoury portion in retirement
and unseen below. He discovers that the "great" are gigantic in
one line, but that "the line upon line" is not their predicate; in
some matters they may perchance be far smaller than their neighbours.
He is no longer the boy without experience of others, or the child
who interprets literally; he measures not the monsters by his own
standard; he endeavours not to poise them by his own weight,&mdash;with
his own girth to buckle their circumference: his acquaintance
serve his turn; society establishes and confirms his experience,
that an average sprinkling of inherent "greatness" may be detected
in all, though the world hath not cared to trumpet it.</p>

<p class="indent">It becomes of difficult endurance to see our intimates thrust,
as it were, on one side,&mdash;morally cast into the mire,&mdash;their qualities
trampled as by heels. It mars our equability to find our friends in
intellectual, philosophical, or worldly utility insinuated as no better
than they should be,&mdash;to hear them classed as of the herd, essentially
and merely gregarious,&mdash;vague portions of an unmeritorious
whole,&mdash;negative existences, positive only in combination,&mdash;cyphers
without value, that multiply but by relative position. Whereas in
our young days we felt personally insulted by contrast with your
"great men," in maturity we resent the impertinence as offered to
our friends; for in our friends we can trace a "greatness," although
the thing may not have been blazoned. Even in a man's household
shall he see greatness, though it be obscure; and he shall discover
that, whilst it is true that no man is "great to his valet," the comfortable
conundrum is equally demonstrable, that <span class="smcap">All</span> are
<span class="smcap">Great</span>. Your groom shall indite you verses that shall
stir the hearts and haunt the dreams of your village maidens&mdash;will they
compare Homer to him?&mdash;and your cook-maid shall be no small domestic oracle
on the unfathomable mysteries of phrenology&mdash;what cares she for Combe
and Spurzheim? Who lives, while yet his father lives, that does not
hear the old man "great" in prophecy on the coming "crisis," and
rich and ponderous upon the currency question? Who, in the book
of the generations of his family, might not inscribe the name of some
brother, a mighty man of valour, great amongst his playmates; or a
sister, whose attire has given tone for a season to an emulous
neighbourhood? And then, in the nineteenth century, who possesses not
"great" uncles, who during the war have swayed, although unknown,
victories by their strategy or disciplined obedience; or, in more
peaceful triumph, have mightily influenced the election of a candidate
by the despotism of their oratory? Of aunts&mdash;maiden ones&mdash;it needs
not to speak. They are of the fortunate who require not greatness
to be "thrust upon them." Of them it is safely assumed, that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
are "born great" prospectively. This privilege however, is guaranteed
to the "maiden" only; for marriage absorbs the bride into unity with her
combined-separate&mdash;and "the crown of a good wife is her husband."</p>

<p class="indent">Your village oracle, seated on his throne&mdash;the old
oaken bench under the village elm-tree, after his weekly labours, on the Saturday
night embalming his tongue in the aroma of the fragrant weed, and
bribing his lips into complacent humour by sips from the chirping old
October, is truly <i>great</i>. He is surrounded by listeners who love to
pay homage to his power. Whilst he whiffs, they consult him on
great interests,&mdash;it may be respecting the destiny of nations, or the
desolating march of hostile armies,&mdash;it may be on the devastations of
the turnip-fly. He lays his pipe aside; his words issue, like the
syllables of the Pythoness, in the midst of fragrant fumes. They fix at
once the unsettled,&mdash;they establish the doubtful,&mdash;they convict the
speculative.</p>

<p class="indent">On points of international law, Puffendorf and Grotius would
shrink into nut-shells before him; they would discover their littleness:
yet some deem <i>them</i> great!</p>

<p class="indent">Bilious disputants may deny that any can be great whom the
world has not thought fit to canonise. "Indeed!" do I reply with the sarcastic
smile of superiority with which it is customary to spill the
arguments of men of straw whom controversialists set up for the sake
of knocking down again&mdash;"Indeed! Were the Andes a whit smaller
before their exact height was proclaimed to the same arrogant world?
Was not the moon as great a ball in the days when the world esteemed
it a green cheese, as it is now, when men are acquainted with its diameter?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay," may reply my subtle disputant; "but these are
physical facts, independent of opinion: mental, moral, social greatness,
are widely different. They have no altitudes subject to trigonometrical
survey by an ordnance-board like the Andes; they admit not of parallax,
like the planets. Master Fridolin, your illustrations are no
more worth than the kernel of a vicious nut."</p>

<p class="indent">"What!" I answer, "you want a metaphysical instance, do you?
Physics are too coarse. Well, sir, '<i>Magna est veritas</i>&mdash;Truth is
great,'&mdash;that is to say, your canoniser, the <i>world</i> say so.
Now, pray, what does the world, much more a man of straw, know about truth?
Confessedly less than it knows about my groom, who is <i>great</i> in
poetry,&mdash;my cook-maid, who is <i>great</i> in phrenology,&mdash;my father,
who is <i>great</i> on those hobgoblins the coming crises; and, let me say,
amazingly less than it knows, or will know, of my aunt Jemima, who was
<i>great</i> in political economy; let alone our village oracle, who is regarded,
pipe and all, as <i>great</i> by a larger portion of the inhabitants of
the <i>world</i> than can boast any intimate acquaintance with abstract verity.</p>

<p class="indent">"And now, man of straw! a word in your ear:&mdash;unless you
are dull in grain, methinks you will admit yourself answered."</p>

<p class="indent">No fallacy is more palpable when examined, and, consequently,
none is more preposterous, than that of connecting <span class="smcap">Greatness</span> with
the <i>world's</i> applause; yet for this, men fume and fret, struggle and
strive, elbow their neighbours, and tread on their own bunnions, forgetting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
that they might be quite as <i>great</i> if they would only be quiet;
nay, that their chance of being so, without exertion, lies, according
to Shakspeare's nice and accurate calculation, in the very comfortable
proportion of two to one in their favour. Two <span class="smcap">Great</span> men
out of every three, find themselves so, without the least trouble on their
own parts. They are born so, or their greatness "is thrust upon
them." They have nothing to do in life but to button in the morning,
unbutton at night, sip, masticate, and sleep, if their conscience
and digestion will permit: they find themselves not a whit less great.
The third alone&mdash;the "odd one"&mdash;acquires <span class="smcap">Greatness</span>; and "odd"
enough it is, to discover a sample of this meagre class.</p>

<p class="indent">But the case may be settled to mathematical certainty. Statistical
inquirers&mdash;men, the breath of whose nostrils are the bills of mortality&mdash;have
discovered that a tenth part of all men born into the world
die and are buried before one brief year has passed. It follows, therefore,
as a corollary, that of those "born great" a great proportion die
<i>great</i> when extremely little. Their nurses see one tenth of all
"the great men" born, fade and expire, hydrocephalic or rickety, ere
their tendencies and tastes have toddled beyond the pap-boat. What
does the world know about this evanescent tenth? What does mankind
trouble about the grave offence of the sepulchre in seizing
and gobbling up annually these great and small tithes? What say
they against its appropriating clause? Why, the world is clearly
ignorant of the departed great ones,&mdash;the buried little ones; yet
their greatness is indisputable.</p>

<p class="indent">The true philosophy of the matter, is the philosophy of
the matters herein set forth; and, in her latter days, my aunt Jemima
acknowledged it, for she felt it. There were no great women when she
was youthful; but she lived to perceive greatness come upon her. It
was not thrust&mdash;it was inherent: but it took time and acted leisurely
in developing itself. It was not a creation or an acquisition, but a
developement, an exudation of that which
would <i>out</i>,&mdash;<i>nolens volens</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The real truth is this,&mdash;<i>All</i> under circumstances
are great, although few are aware that they are so. Celebrity has nothing to do
with the affair; it may proclaim the fact, but does not constitute
it;&mdash;as will hereafter be shown in the instance of my aunt Jemima.</p>

<h2>SCENES IN THE LIFE OF A GAMBLER.</h2>

<p class="center space-below1">"Lasciate ogni speranza voi che entrate."</p>

<p class="indent">Paris!&mdash;there was once a magic in the name&mdash;a music
in the sound. "Paris!" how often said I to myself when in another quarter
of the globe, "Yes, I will one day visit thee&mdash;will revive the memory
of the great events of which thou hast been the arena&mdash;thy Fronde&mdash;the
League&mdash;the Revolution&mdash;the Cent Jours&mdash;the history of thy
chivalrous François&mdash;thy noble-minded Henri&mdash;the Grand Monarque&mdash;the
witty and profligate Regent&mdash;thy unfortunate Louis, and still
more pitiable Empereur;&mdash;and then, the Gallery of the Louvre&mdash;the
Museum of the Luxembourg&mdash;Versailles&mdash;St. Cloud&mdash;the Tuileries!"
My dream was about to be realised.</p>

<p class="indent">I was then in my twenty-fifth year. I had health&mdash;a sufficiency
of the goods of fortune to purchase the enjoyment of the moderate pleasures
of life. My person and manners were agreeable; my acquirements
greater then those of most of my college contemporaries; and
the fine arts were "my passion and my enjoyment." All these advantages,
with a pardonable egotism, I had been canvassing during
my solitary journey (solitary? no, my mind was occupied with the
most enchanting reveries&mdash;the most intoxicating visions) from which
I was only awakened at the barrier of Montmartre. How my heart
beat with delight as, from the eminence that overlooks the city, I beheld
its spires, and domes, and houses, huddled in the vaporous gloom
of an evening in May! The day had been a glorious one; the air
breathed balm. My caleche was open; and four posters whirled me
rapidly through the Boulevards, and entered the gateway of the
Hotel des Princes in the Rue Richelieu. This street was, as all who
are acquainted with it, know, the centre and focus of the fashion,&mdash;the
life and motion of Paris, and of the foreigners who then flocked
to it from all parts of Europe, (for it was the third year of the
Restoration,) and had caught some of the volatile spirit of
its mercurial people.</p>

<p class="indent">Times and dynasties change. Politics, that many-headed
monster, now reigns supreme. Instead of the goddess Pleasure,&mdash;at whose
shrine all sacrificed,&mdash;they have set up the Gorgon of parties. The
army is no "état"&mdash;the church is no "état." It is become a city of
national guards&mdash;reviewed by a king, with his three sons,&mdash;a family
marked for assassination. There is no court&mdash;no <i>ancienne noblesse</i>.
Everywhere distress and misery, hate and calumny, persecution and
imprisonment, ruin, the grippe, and bankruptcy. Such is a picture of
the Paris of 1837.</p>

<p class="indent">But I was in the Rue Richelieu&mdash;the great artery of the
life's blood of Paris. From it, as from a floodgate, rushed along in conflicting
eddies, sweeping like a torrent, a crowd in quest of pleasure.
Some were hurrying to the gaming-houses; some <i>aux Italiens</i>, to the
Ambigu, of the Varietés, and the different theatres; others to the
Palais Royal, which in its magic circle comprehends all that vice
or luxury can invent to seduce the imagination or gratify the sense;
then to Tortoni's, or the innumerable cafés, there to enjoy the <i>al
fresco</i> of the Boulevards Italiens seated under the trees, or to mingle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
with the multitude, chatting, laughing, or whispering in delighted
ears under the well-lighted avenue of elms that had just put forth their
young leaves. I made one of the throng, and would that <i>Armida</i> Paris
had had no worse enchantments&mdash;no more seductive pleasures. Alas!
what have I now to do with them?&mdash;they have lost their charm. My
hair is grey,&mdash;my heart is withered!</p>

<p class="indent">But I anticipate.</p>

<p class="indent">What do the phrenologists mean, by not having assigned to
their chart of the skull a place for play? Gall, during his long practice in
Paris, might surely have discovered it; for, of all people, the Parisians
have this passion the most strongly developed. It is common, indeed,
to the most savage, as well as the most civilised nations; for I have
seen the Hindu strip himself naked, and bet at chukra the last rag in
his possession; the African stakes his wife and children; but our
neighbours may plunge their families, to the third and fourth generation,
in misery and destitution. The pauper sells his only bed: the
cradle of his child. The manufacturer takes to the Mont de Pieté his
tools; steals those of his employers. The diplomatist and the figurante,
the financier and the mendicant, all fall down before one idol&mdash;a
Moloch worse than that of the Valley of Gehenna&mdash;a monster without
pity or remorse, who delights in the tears, and groans, and gnashings
of teeth of his votaries, nor quits his prey till he tracks them to the
Morgue&mdash;name of horrid sound! and yet, the last refuge and sole
resting-place of his infatuated victims.</p>

<p class="indent">How easy it is to moralise! I should like to know if I always
had this infernal bias, or if it was engrafted in me, or whether I was seized
at that time with the general epidemy, taking the infection, like
the cholera, from those about me, or from the air which I was respiring.
Oh, worse than wind-walking pestilence is play! It has a
subtle poison, and more kinds of death; no, not death! for,
<i>I</i> live,&mdash;if dying from day to day can be called life.</p>

<p class="indent">The first weeks of my <i>séjour</i> passed like days, nay hours;
but I did not confine myself to Paris itself. Few foreigners, or even natives,
know the beauty of the environs. These were the scenes of my
rides by day. In the evening I assisted at some French <i>réunion</i>,
or mixed in the <i>soirées</i> of our own country; frequented the Opera
Italienne, where not a note is lost: and such notes!&mdash;for Pasta
was the prima donna. Being "<i>un peu friand</i>," I frequently
dined at the Rocher de Concal. I mention that restaurant because
I have reason to remember it. The Rocher de Concal boasts none of
the magnificence of Very's, or Beauvilliers. The entrance is encumbered
with the shells of the <i>huitres d'Ostende</i>, the most delicious of
oysters. The rooms are not much larger than boxes at the opera;
but they enclose a world of fun. The rustling of silk is often heard
there, and one meets in the narrow passages veiled forms hastening
to some mysterious rendezvous.</p>

<p class="indent">It was here that I became acquainted with the Prince M&mdash;&mdash;.
His was a fatal initial; and might have reminded me of what he proved to
be,&mdash;my Mephistophiles! M&mdash;&mdash; was one of those princes that
"<i>fourmillent</i>" in all the capitals of Europe. He was about thirty
years of age. His figure was tall, slight, and emaciated, and corresponded
with his countenance, that was of a paleness approaching to
marble, and might be said to have no expression, so complete a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
mastery had he obtained over his feelings. His equipage had nothing
at first sight remarkable. The cabriolet was of a sombre colour,
and the harness without ornaments; but the horse was not to be
matched for beauty and power. His dress seemed equally plain;
but, on closer inspection, you discovered it was of a studied elegance,
the colours being so well matched that the eye had nothing particular
on which to rest. He never was known to laugh, and seldom
smiled; he was rather cold, though not forbidding in his manners,
and perfectly indifferent whether he amused or not. He never spoke
of the politics of the day, of his domains, of his stud or family,&mdash;much
less of himself, his exploits, or his adventures. He never made
an observation that was worthy of being repeated, yet never said a
foolish thing. With the sex he was a great favourite, for he perfectly
understood the science of flattery; but it was with the utmost tact that
he put it in requisition. His address was perfect: he spoke French,
and indeed several languages, with that admirable choice of phrase
for which the Russians are remarkable. The sole occupation of his
life was play; and to win or lose seemed a matter of perfect indifference
to him, whatever the stake.</p>

<p class="indent">There was also of the party that day another foreigner, Baron
A&mdash;&mdash;, who had been a Jew. He was his <i>compagnon de voyage</i>.
Castor and Pollux were not more inseparable. This <i>alter ego</i> was a
little man, with a grey eye of singular archness, and a light moustache,
as most Germans have. His whole fortune consisted of five hundred
louis, which he carried about with him;&mdash;an excellent nest-egg; for
he contrived to double annually this poor capital. One year he was
at Rome, another at Florence, a third at Vienna&mdash;no; there he was
too well known. A gambler, like a prophet, has no honour in his own
country. The last spring he had passed in London, where, of course,
he had the <i>entrée</i> at Almack's, and now opened the campaign under
the most promising auspices at Paris. The baron was a sort of
lion's-provider&mdash;the pilot-fish of the shark.</p>

<p class="indent">We separated at an early hour, and I afterwards met my new
<i>friends</i> at an hotel in the Fauxbourg St. Honoré, where there was, as usual,
an écarté-table. Ecarté was then all the rage; though, like our all-fours,
it had originally been the game of the <i>peuple</i>, or rather in Paris of
the <i>laquais</i>. It is a game uniting skill and chance; but it is a game
of countenance; a game, also, in which the cards played with, being
fewer in number than at whist, it is no difficult matter to scratch an
important one, so as to know in time of need where to find it, or to
<i>sauter le coup</i>. That evening, for the first time, I was induced to
take a hand, and, in my innocence of such man&oelig;uvres, wondered that
my opponent turned up the king so much oftener than myself. In
time my eyes were opened, and I discovered that other <i>tricheries</i>
were practicable. For instance, one morning, after a ball given by an
English lady, there were found rolled up in one corner of the room two
queens and a knave; and, on examining the écarté packs, these were
missing,&mdash;had literally been discarded,&mdash;a circumstance which rendered
the success of two officers of the <i>garde de corps</i>, who cleaned
out the party, by no means problematical. But I was now initiated;
and a witty writer says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That where that pestilence, play, once leaves a taint,</span>
<span class="i0">It saps the bone, and pierces to the marrow,</span>
<span class="i0">And then 'tis easier to extract an arrow."</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">How willing we all are to put off the evil moment: to
string anecdote on anecdote, and weave parenthesis in parenthesis, rather
than come to the point! Does it not remind us of the tricks of the
wrestler to avoid the grasp of his more powerful antagonist? But it
must come: so let me proceed with my confession.</p>

<p class="indent">As I was leaving the room, the prince came up to me and said,
"Demain voulez-vous, Monsieur, être des notres?&mdash;There is a dinner
at the <i>salon</i>, and I will take you with me as my 'umbra,' and present
you to the Marquis&mdash;." In an evil hour I consented.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>maisons de jeu</i> at Paris are farmed by a society, who
purchase of the government the privilege of opening a certain limited number&mdash;if
I remember right, five. In order to prevent unfair play, a <i>commis</i>
of the police is in daily attendance at the opening of the packs of
cards, and they are lodged in the office every night. So far so good.
But the advantages in favour of the bank are so great, that after the
payment of several hundred thousand pounds sterling to the revenue,
after defraying the expenses of hotels, cashiers, croupiers, lackeys,
&amp;c. &amp;c. the <i>associés</i> divide twenty or thirty per cent. At the head
of these establishments is the <i>salon des étrangers</i>. The prime minister,
or master of the ceremonies, was then the Marquis de L&mdash;&mdash;. He
was the last of the <i>aisles de pigeon</i>, which he wore <i>bien poudrées</i>.
He had been an <i>emigré</i>, and, like many of them, had passed twenty years
in England without knowing a word of the language. He was distinguished
by an ease of manner and a politeness, though rather exaggerated,
of the <i>vieille cour</i>. Soon after my introduction to him he lost
his appointment, it having been discovered that the cashier, <i>by some
mistake</i>, nightly gave him fifty napoleons in exchange for a billet of
five hundred francs. By-the-by, the office of president of the <i>salon</i>
was in considerable request, and was afterwards filled by a general
officer who had once been in the English service.</p>

<p class="indent">It was one of the dinners that were given three times a-week.
We passed through a range of servants in splendid liveries, to the <i>salon à
manger</i>, where I found sixty guests, consisting, not only of the foreigners
most distinguished for rank, fortune, and consideration, but
<i>pairs de France, deputés</i> of all parties,&mdash;in fact, the <i>élite</i> of
Paris. Before each, was placed a <i>carte</i>. It was not one of your English bills
of fare, with its <i>plats de resistance</i>; but earth, air, and ocean had been
ransacked, and all the skill of the most consummate <i>artistes</i> employed
to furnish out the table. Every sort of wine circulated in quick succession;
but, when I looked around me, I saw no hilarity in this
assembly. The viands seemed to pall upon the taste, the goblet
passed unquaffed. Gambling is the most selfish of vices; it admits
of no society; every one seemed too much occupied with his own
thoughts even to address his neighbour. Was I happy myself? No.
The soul instinctively seems to foresee all the miseries that originate
from a single false step, inspiring us with certain vague apprehensions
that with a vain casuistry we endeavour to dissipate. In fact,
I never enjoyed a dinner less; and was as pleased at its termination
as most of the party were anxious for the real object of the meeting&mdash;<i>le
commencement de la fin, ou la fin du commencement&mdash;le jeu</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The hotel where we assembled was of the time of Louis
the Fifteenth, and had belonged to one of his numerous mistresses; the
taste, however, of his predecessor reigned there. In front was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
<i>cour d'honneur</i>, large enough to drawn the rattle of carriages and
noise from without; and behind, was a garden laid out in the English
style, and full of odoriferous shrubs, then in full bloom, particularly
the lilac, the laburnum, and the red-thorn, that wafted their perfume
through the unfolded doors, whilst at intervals was heard the plashing
of a fountain. The three principal rooms, two of which were dedicated
to <i>rouge et noir</i> and French hazard, were in shape octagonal;
the compartments, which were fantastically chased, and rich in gilding,
served as a frame-work to pictures in the manner of Watteau, and
probably by the hand of one of his pupils. The ceilings were similar
in taste, and described some exploits of Jupiter, whose representative
was the monarch himself according to the fashion of the day. The
only light in each of these apartments, proceeded from a lamp shaded
by green silk, that diffused its mellow and softened rays around, and
threw a brilliant and dazzling effulgence on the table. Along the
centre were ranged the dealers and bankers; and before them heaps
of gold and silver, and <i>billets de banc</i>, and red and white counters,
their representatives. On both sides were the players; and the broad
glare, shadowless and impending, displayed their features. Many of
them were known to me by name. There was, with his noble and
portly figure and countenance, much resembling the busts of Charles
Fox, the late Earl of T&mdash;&mdash;, who with perfect <i>sangfroid</i>
lost his twenty-five thousand pounds a-year, and thought the only use of
money was to buy pieces of ivory marked with numbers on them, and
that the next pleasure in life to winning, was to lose. To his right
was B&mdash;&mdash; H&mdash;&mdash;, with his handsome profile, Hyperion locks,
and unmeaning red-and-white face, incapable of an expression either of
joy or chagrin: Lord M&mdash;&mdash;, who went by the sobriquet of Père la
Chaise; S&mdash;&mdash;, bent double with care, and wrinkled with premature
old age; the young and emaciated Lord Y&mdash;&mdash;, the only one of his
family who resembles his father, and inheriting from him the same
propensity: and by his side Benjamin Constant, whose ardent spirit,
like the volcano under Vesuvius, was for ever breaking out in the
excitement of love, or politics, or play; his hair was grey, as if
scorched by the working of his brain; his frame consumed as by an
inward fire; his cheek bloodless as that of a corpse, for which, but for
his eye, he might have been taken;&mdash;there was a desolateness in every
trait of his countenance, and nervous sensibility accompanied every
cast of the die that it was painful to witness. These were some of
the <i>crêpes</i> party. The Prince M&mdash;&mdash; was not among them: he had
found more attractive metal&mdash;was closeted in a cabinet at écarté.</p>

<p class="indent">For some hours I looked on, as an indifferent spectator.
I had come fortified by a long colloquy held with myself, the result of
which was a determination not to be duped. I had had too much
experience of the world to fall into the snare&mdash;I had resisted many
worse temptations&mdash;I knew too well the chances to risk even the few
napoleons cautiously put into my purse. "Facilis descensus Averni,"
says the poet. Insensibly I took an interest in the game. I flattered
my self-vanity by thinking that, when such a one threw in, I should
not have been on the <i>contre</i>, or should have withdrawn my money
before he <i>sauted</i>,&mdash;that I should have taken the odds, or betted
them differently from Lord This or Monsieur <i>Tel</i>. In short, for me the
veil of Isis was lifted, the mysteries of play revealed. I alone was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
inspired; and so for once it was to prove. One of the circle left his
seat, and I filled up the vacancy. I sat writhing till my turn came.
All had thrown out, and all had backed the casters. I now took the
box: by my clumsy way of handling it, and shaking the dice, it was
perceived that I was a tyro. And now the <i>contre</i> was covered with
gold and notes: "Seven!" I cried; "eleven's the nick!" I changed
the main: still my luck continued. In short, I threw in nine times,
leaving all my winnings to accumulate, and found myself in possession
of twenty-four thousand francs. It was now suggested to me that the
bank was only responsible for twelve thousand. Twice more did I
tempt Fortune, and with equal success; and then handed over the box,
and gave up my place to a new comer; and, without any one seeming
to notice my departure, betook myself to my apartment&mdash;but not to
sleep. I was in a fever of delight; visions more enchanting than
those of Eldorado visited my couch. I had found the magic wand,&mdash;had
gained the golden branch in the Æneid,&mdash;opened to myself a
mine of wealth,&mdash;an inexhaustible treasure. At daybreak I raised
myself in the bed, and counted it,&mdash;arranged in heaps the glittering
treasure. I had all Paris in my hand! I would have an hotel, I would
have horses, carriages, all that wealth could purchase should be mine.
That gold which others sighed for, toiled for, sinned for, was mine,
easily obtained, and won expressly to be spent. Horace, when in his
poetic dream of immortality he cried "Album mutor in alitem," and
soared above the heads of the admiring world, felt no raptures compared
with mine.</p>

<p class="indent">My success was soon blazoned abroad, and my gains exaggerated.
In the course of the day I had a visit of congratulation from the
prince. "There is a fête and ball at Frascati," said he, on taking leave;
"you will be there?" There was a devilish smile on his face. It was
the first time I had ever seen him smile.</p>

<p class="indent">It was ten o'clock, and that temple of Circe was flooded with
light, and filled with women and men of all ages;&mdash;no, not of all, for one
of the conditions of admission is, besides being well dressed, that a person
must be <i>of age</i>. <i>Le Jeu</i> has no objection to the gold of a father,
a lover, or a husband; but he disdains the pocket-money of a minor.
He has great respect for all the decencies of life: he requires a
well-filled purse and an elegant toilette. Enter, ye rich and lively!&mdash;come,
and welcome! There is sure to be gold where there are women,
and woman where there is gold.</p>

<p class="indent">At the entrance of this hell, the <i>laquais</i>, after a scrutiny
of my person, took my hat, and, by means of an iron instrument attached to
a long pole, with a practised dexterity lifted it to peg 200, where it
assumed its place in the well-marshalled ranks of its comrades. I
afterwards observed that it was the only thing most of the owners
carried away with them.</p>

<p class="indent">The first room was occupied by a roulette table. The grand
saloon,&mdash;of which there is, or was, an admirable picture in the Oxford
Street Bazaar, containing the well-known portraits of very many who
frequented it,&mdash;is dedicated to <i>rouge et noir</i>, or <i>trente et quarante</i>, and
was encircled two or three deep by a crowd of both sexes, all preserving
a profound silence, only interrupted by the <i>Messieurs, faites
votre jeu!&mdash;Le jeu est fait!&mdash;Rien plus!</i> of the dealer; for the noise of
the <i>ratliers</i> that had shovelled the gold and five-franc pieces into a heap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
had ceased, and all were breathlessly awaiting the <i>coup</i>. The <i>coup</i> was
made: <i>quarante: Rouge gagne</i>. It was then a horrid sight to mark
the expression of the different feelings that agitated this assembly&mdash;this
Pandæmonium! Some tore their hair from their heads in handsful,&mdash;some
gnashed their teeth like the damned in the Sistine chapel,&mdash;others,
their eyes almost starting out of their sockets, uttered horrid
oaths, and blasphemous exclamations,&mdash;and one, who had his hand
in his breast, withdrew it, dyed in blood, without being sensible of the
wounds his nails had inflicted! But, as if this spectacle of tortured
and degraded humanity were not enough, it was still more appalling
to observe the countenances of the women, who had staked their last
louis on the turn of the card! Their splendid dresses, their silks and
gauze, their <i>cachemires de l'Inde</i>, that glitter of gold and gems, their
necklaces of pearl, and ear-rings of diamond,&mdash;all that serves to
heighten and embellish beauty, by a horrid contrast only gave them
a greater deformity, reminding us of Pauline Borghese on her death-bed
daubing her cadaverous cheeks with rouge, and tricking herself
out in the same magnificent costume she had worn in the Tuileries
when she shone the wonder and admiration of Paris; assuming
in the last agonies of dissolution the voluptuous attitude she had
chosen for that masterpiece of art, that wonderful creation of the
greatest of modern sculptors, Canova.</p>

<p class="indent">Oh! that these Phrynes could at that moment have seen in the
mirrors that on all sides reflected them, their hollow eyes&mdash;their violet
lips&mdash;their livid cheeks! The snakes of Leonardo's Medusa would
have made them perfect. No; they had no eyes or ears but for that
hideous old Sultan whose seraglio they had formed,&mdash;<i>le Jeu</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>rouge et noir</i> table being thus <i>agreeably</i> filled,
I sat down to roulette, and placed before me my packet of notes; being determined
this time to break the bank. I turned some of my <i>billets</i> into
gold, and began, during the revolutions of the wheel of Fortune, to
cover the cyphers. Sixty-two times the original stake would be good
interest for less than as many seconds! Now for my inspiration&mdash;but
this time my spirit of prophecy had fled. There was no prize for me.
The ball still made its accustomed rounds, and lost itself in some
number where I had no stake: now it bounded along, and hung suspended
like a bird hovering over its nest; and then, just as it was
about to crown my wishes, took a new spring, and, with a provoking
coquetry, lavished its favours on one who had not courted them with
half, perhaps only the twentieth part, of the fervour I had done.
Sometimes, as if to lead me on in the pursuit, she tantalised me by
hiding herself in the next number to that I had chosen; and then, the
succeeding minute crushed all my hopes, and reduced them to nothing,
with some zero rouge or zero blanc, or the double misery of
two zeros.</p>

<p class="indent">I now gave up the lottery of numbers, and betook myself to
that of colours. Still I was no diviner. If I made black my favourite, there
was sure to be a run on red; and <i>vice versâ</i>. I lost my coolness&mdash;my
temper. I doubled my stakes,&mdash;trebled them. Still the <i>ratliers</i> did
their merciless office; the <i>croupiers</i> still with imperturbable nonchalance
swept into a gulph, from which was no return, my notes and
gold. In short, in a few hours, I was not only stript of all my winnings,
but had borrowed of one of the lackeys three thousand francs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
which I was to return the next morning, with a premium of two per
cent. He was one of the myrmidons of the <i>salon des étrangers</i>, and
knew I had the <i>entrée</i>, and that the loan was a safe one; nay, he
pressed me to borrow more: but&mdash;<i>ohe, jam satis!</i>&mdash;I hurried to
my porter's lodge, and thence to my apartment, but in a widely different
mood to that in which I had entered it the night before. All the scenes
of wealth and riches that my imagination had conjured up, had vanished.
I had horrid dreams. The curtain was withdrawn; it showed
me the sad reality of all that had happened, and all that was to happen.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day I locked my room-door, and held a long dialogue
with my conscience. I felt two powers at work within me&mdash;two inclinations
striving for mastery&mdash;two persons, as it were, one acting against
and in spite of the other. I endeavoured to arm myself against myself.
It was a violent struggle between the principles of good and
evil. Whether, like Hercules, I should have made the same choice,
I know not; but vice never wants for arguments or supporters, and
in the afternoon came an invitation, by one of his emissaries, from the
prince, to dine with him. My foible&mdash;the rock on which I have made
shipwreck&mdash;has been, that I never could say, no. I accepted it.</p>

<p class="indent">Besides the inseparables, were present, on this occasion, a
Prussian colonel and a Polish count. The dinner was <i>recherché</i>; the dishes
having been sent from different <i>restaurants</i> famous for their <i>cuisine</i>:
the <i>ravioli</i>, for instance, from an Italian house, and the <i>omelette Russe</i>
from the <i>café de Paris</i>. The mock and real champagne were well
iced, and the Chambertín a bouquet of violets. I endeavoured to find
a Lethe in the glass, which circulated freely, though it only circulated;
for the prince, on the plea of health, drank lemonade, and his
guests, as the Italians say, baptised their Lafitte with water. Two
nights such as I had passed did not diminish the effect of the wine;
and when it was proposed to play at faro, though I knew nothing of
the game, I made no objection. It was suggested that the baron should
be banker. He had come ready prepared; opened his strong box,
and produced his five hundred louis. The practised neatness with
which he turned up the cards, the accuracy of his calculations, and
correctness of his accounts, might have excited the admiration of
any <i>croupier</i> at the <i>salon</i>; certainly none of them understood
his <i>métier</i> better. I began with very small stakes, which were unlimited.
I soon, however, followed the example of the circle, and played higher.
I lost. The two strangers appeared to lose also, and retired at an early hour.</p>

<p class="indent">I had added one hundred louis to the baron's capital. Whilst
I was in search of my hat to make my escape, A&mdash;&mdash; had been employed in
preparing an écarté pack, and offered to give me my <i>revanche</i>; our
host encouraging me to take it by saying he would back me.</p>

<p class="indent">I sat down; and, as the prince was interested in the result,
I asked his advice, but he told me, he never gave or took it. My adversary
had an extraordinary run of luck,&mdash;almost always <i>voled</i> me when
I did not propose, and scored the king so often that I could not help
observing it. The prince in the mean time walked about the room,
occasionally looking over my cards; at length he declined participating
in my stakes, and betted with me largely on his own account.
Ill fortune continued to pursue me; still I played higher and higher,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
till my score had swelled to a frightful amount. My immense losses
sobered me, and I then had my suspicions that all was not right.
Opposite to the table was a mirror over the chimney, which extended
from the marble-slab to the ceiling. I was fronting it, when I perceived
by the reflection, the prince standing over my shoulder: he
was taking snuff, and, in the act of so doing, raised up his fingers in
a manner that excited my attention. I now determined to watch
the pair more closely. I observed that the German always awaited
the sign before he decided on proposing or refusing; and once inadvertently
did so, without even looking at his own hand. It is true,
we were both at four, but I had not an <i>atout</i> or court-card: the
consequence was, that I lost the game. It was now clear that I had
fallen into the hands of sharpers. I found myself minus thirty thousand
francs. Throwing down the pack, I got up, and walked about
the room for some time, in order to collect my thoughts and consider
how to act. Though confident of having been cheated; almost unknown
as I was in Paris, I was aware it would not be easy to convince
their numerous and powerful friends of the fact. I therefore
determined to pay the money, and insult one or the other so grossly
that he must give me my <i>revanche</i> in a different way. Thinking that
the scheme, however concocted, had been put in execution at the
prince's own house, and that it was rendered still blacker by a breach
of hospitality, I made choice of him with perfect self-possession. I
asked for pen, ink, and paper; and having written cheques payable
on demand at my bankers' in London for the <i>par nobile fratrum</i>, I
turned to the prince, and said, presenting him with his share of the
plunder, "Monsieur, voilà votre argent: vous savez comment il étoit
gagné." Running his eye over the amount to ascertain if it were
correct, he carefully folded up the paper, and put it in his pocket;
and then, with imperturbable coolness, turned to me, and said,
"Monsieur, vous m'avez insulté, et vous me ferez l'honneur de m'en
rendre raison." "Très, très volontiers," I replied; "c'est ce que je
cherchois." "The sooner the better," said the prince; "I will leave
my friend the baron to settle the preliminaries." With these words
he walked slowly to the door, and left me with his associate. He
had not been gone more than a few minutes, when the Polish count,
who was lodging in the same hotel, (it was in the Rue de la Paix,)
and had just returned from some orgies, made his appearance, probably
thinking to find us still engaged in play. The baron, without
entering into particulars, immediately explained to him that the
prince and myself had had a serious misunderstanding, and that it
had ended in his claiming satisfaction. I was not sufficiently intimate
with any one in Paris to disturb him at that hour in the morning;
and, thinking it a mere formality to have a second, readily asked the
count to be my friend. He consented with the best grace imaginable.
It was now explained to me, that it is the custom (though I believe
such is not the case) for the challenger to choose his own weapons.</p>

<p class="indent">"The prince," observed the baron, "has two blades of the
finest Spanish steel; they are beautifully watered, and it is a pleasure to
look at them. They have never yet been used: Monsieur," added
he, addressing the count, "shall have his choice." All this was
said with the utmost nonchalance, as though he had been only treating
of a trial of skill, and not a duel <i>à l'outrance</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">I had never taken a fencing-lesson since I was at school,
and then only for a few months of old Angelo. The prince I knew to
be almost as dexterous in the art as a <i>maître d'armes</i>. The first
qualification for an accomplished gambler is to be a duellist; foils
were at that moment lying in a corner of the room, and he had probably
been practising the very day before; indeed it was almost the
only exercise he took at any time.</p>

<p class="indent">To have made, however, my want of skill a plea for the
adoption of pistols, might, I knew, be answered by the baron's professing the
prince to be the worst of shots; besides its being a deviation from
the established rule in such cases for me to have a voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Strange to say, I felt little uneasiness on the subject:
I had a quick eye, great activity, and superior physical strength; and I had
heard that the most expert fencer is often at a loss to parry the
determined assault of an aggressor, even though he should hardly
know the use of his weapon. A sense, too, of my wrongs, and a
desire of revenge, added to that moral courage in which I was never
deficient, rendered me bold and confident.</p>

<p class="indent">It was now broad daylight. The <i>fiacre</i> rattled up to the
door, and the count and I, got into it; the prince following in his cabriolet,
accompanied by A&mdash;&mdash;. We drove through the <i>Champs Elyseés</i>, passed
the <i>Port Maillot</i>, and, without meeting a single carriage, arrived at
our destination. If there were ever a spot where a lover of nature
might die almost without regret, it is this favourite resort of the
<i>beau monde</i> of Paris. Avenues ankle-deep in sand, cut into straight
lines; <i>allées</i> without verdure, that lead to nothing; a wood without
trees. Such is the <i>Bois de Boulogne</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The coachman, who had a perfect knowledge of the localities,
and the object of our morning ride, pulled up at a spot where four roads
met; and, having alighted, we followed an ill-defined path for a few
hundred yards, till we came to an opening in the brushwood that
was scarcely above our heads. It had served for a recent encounter,
for I perceived the prince step on one side to avoid a stain of blood
on one of the tufts of grass that here and there rose rankly among
the sand. He appeared not to notice it, and continued to talk on
indifferent subjects to his companion.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Having received our swords, all new, and bright,
and glittering, as the baron promised they should be, and taken up our ground,
without waiting to cross blades, I precipitated myself on my adversary,
and endeavoured to beat down his guard: so impetuous was
my onset, that he retreated, or, rather, I drove him before me for
several yards. Those who have not experienced it, may conceive
what a strange grating sensation the meeting of two pieces of steel
produces; but they cannot be aware how it quickens the pulse, and
that there is in every electric shock, such fierce rage, and hatred,
and revenge, as burnt within me then. Still, however, the prince
parried my thrusts, and kept me at arm's length. All I now remember
is, that I made a last desperate lunge&mdash;that I almost lost my
balance&mdash;that I felt the point of my adversary's sword enter my side,
and then a film came over my eyes. When I awoke from this trance,
I found myself in a crowded hospital, with a
<i>S&oelig;ur de Charité</i> leaning over me.

<h2>THE ANATOMY OF COURAGE.</h2>
<p class="f90">BY PRINCE PUCKLER MUSKAU.<br />IN A LETTER TO A FRIEND.</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">As for the article of courage and its various
manifestations, it is a very peculiar thing: I have thought much about it, and
observed a great deal; and I am convinced that, except in romances, there are
very few men who at all times show distinguished, and <i>none at all</i> who
possess <i>perfect</i> courage. I should esteem any man who maintained
the contrary of himself, and who asserted that he did not know what
fear was, a mere braggart; but, nevertheless, I should not consider
it my duty to tell him so, to his face. There are endless <i>varieties</i> of
courage, which may, however, be comprised under three general dispositions
of temperament, and six principal rubrics; within this arrangement
a thousand modifications still remain, but I cannot here pursue them.</p>

<p class="indent">We come, first, to three sorts of that courage which alone can be
called natural, and which, like all that nature gives <i>directly</i>, is perfect;
that is, without any mixture of fear so long as <i>it lasts</i>, and
which, therefore, has only a temporary influence. These are,</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;1. Courage from passion, such as love, anger,
vengeance, and so forth.</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;2. From hunger, or the want of any thing
indispensable to existence.</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;3. From habit, which, according to a law of nature,
hardens completely against particular kinds of permanent danger.</p>

<p class="indent">All the others are artificial, but not, therefore, imperfect;
that is, they are not always without admixture of fear, the result either of a
dawning, or on already advanced state of civilization. They may be divided into</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;<i>a.</i> Courage out of vanity.</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;<i>b.</i> Out of a feeling of honour.</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;<i>c.</i> Out of duty; under which head may be reckoned
the inspiration of religion, and all kinds of enthusiasm; which is also closely
allied to <i>a</i>. At last we come to the physical conformation which supports
courage, or renders it difficult of exhibition, or puts it altogether
out of the question.</p>

<p class="indent">(There is certainly a fourth kind of courage, in some measure
the shady side of the others,&mdash;courage from avarice. I omitted it, because
it is rather an enormity, and can only produce criminals; it is, therefore,
allied to madness, of which I do not speak here.)</p>

<p class="indent">They are, firstly, a strong and healthy nervous system,
and a sanguine temperament.</p>

<p class="indent">Secondly, a weak and excitable constitution, which is called
<i>par excellence</i> a nervous constitution.</p>

<p class="indent">Thirdly, that unfortunate defective formation, probably of
the nerves of the brain, which produces an unconquerable timidity, becomes
real suffering and a regular malady, rendering all manifestations
of courage next to impossible.</p>

<p class="indent">That these divisions are subject to more or less modification,
and often branch off into each other through inward motives, or external
influences, follows of course. I will in few words touch upon these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
powers in their general and universal operation, and examine how the
different value of the chief combinations are classified.</p>

<p class="indent">One, two, and three, I give up; for every one knows that
with both man and beast, when a beloved object is in danger, or under the
influence of a natural impulse, or when animated by a blind rage, or
pinched by hunger, instinct alone acts, and timidity vanishes: but let
the excitement cease, and the courage disappears also. When full of
food, the lion flees before the feeblest man; and, when the hunger of
the terrible boa is quite appeased, it may be laid hold of, without
danger. It is equally well known that habit would make us forget
the sword suspended over our heads by a single hair. The soldier,
continually in battle, is as indifferent to bullets as the boy to the
flying ball: and yet the same soldier would shudder at a species of
danger that the most cowardly spy encounters in cold blood, and, in
all probability, would feel real terror if he were compelled to a conflict
with a tiger, which the timid Indian, armed with a short sword,
and protected only by a green shield, will go in search of and subdue.
The boldest mariner is often absurdly fearful in a carriage; and I have
known a brave officer who turned pale whenever he was obliged to
leap his horse over a hedge or a ditch.</p>

<p class="indent">But the case is very different when the courage of civilisation
makes common cause with the physical disposition. If No. 1, in its
highest perfection, be conjoined with <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, it is easy
to see that the individual uniting the whole will be the bravest possible man;
when, however, No. 1 stands alone, precious as it is, in, and for itself,
there is but little dependence on it. The weaker No. 2, united to
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, or <i>c</i>, is a rock compared to it: for the last motives
have this great and invaluable quality&mdash;they are lasting, while No. 1 depends
upon time and circumstance; and then will produce only the <i>so-called</i>
naturally brave, of whom the Spaniards say, <i>He was brave in his day</i>;
No. 1 reduced to his own resources would perhaps encounter with
vermilion cheeks and perfect cheerfulness, danger that would make
No. 2 + <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, or <i>c</i>, pale and serious.</p>

<p class="indent">Notwithstanding this, it is by no means certain whether No. 1
would not be seized with a panic in the fight, for all his red cheeks;
but No. 2, with his powerful auxiliary, certain that he must fight, is
quite secure, while the colour returns to his cheek even in the midst
of the danger. As soon as fear seizes No. 1, it must influence his
action; with No. 2 + <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, or <i>c</i>, it is a matter of
indifference whether he feels fear or no, as it will be neutralized by
the permanent auxiliary qualifications, and its influence on his actions nullified.
And, although No. 1 + <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, must always remain the
<i>summum perfectum</i>, yet No. 2 + <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, will sometimes
do bolder and more surprising things, because the nervous excitement is more
strongly acted on; especially if enthusiasm be brought into play.</p>

<p class="indent">The other sex, for instance, never possess any other than
this species of courage; and if our manners had not, as well out of vanity, as
a feeling of honour and duty, entirely dispensed with courage in
them, and directed their whole education on this principle, then a
lady, No. 2 + <i>a</i> alone, even without <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, would certainly
have surpassed the bravest man in point of courage, and would probably
have been victor in every combat, where only this courage and its
endurance, and not merely physical strength or skill, should decide.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">No. 1 gifted also with <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, would be brave
sometimes, and sometimes not; if No. 2, however, were equally <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>,
<i>c</i>, then the disadvantageous side of such a disposition would come into action,
and No. 2 would in this case be a regular portion, not so much <i>because</i> he
<i>must</i> be such, like No. 3, but because it would be far more convenient, and
more suitable to his nature: such would be many men in the lower,
and the whole dear sex in the highest, degree. The undeniably cowardly
disposition of the Jews has the same foundation. We have so
long denied them human and social rights, that the motives of vanity
and the sense of honour can operate but feebly on them, while that of
duty in relation to us can scarcely exist at all. Nothing but centuries
of a more reasonable and humane policy can render this otherwise.</p>

<p class="indent">The unfortunate No. 3 would only be courageous in two
predicaments; in half-frantic religious ecstacy, or in despair, itself the
very extremity of fear, when he might reach a point beyond the limits of
courage. We have seen, for example, people destroy themselves out of dread of death!</p>

<p class="indent">What I have here said, little as it is, appears to me sufficient
to point out a mode of drawing new deductions from every possible combination;
to determine their relative value; and, what is most important of all,
to excite further reflections, from which all may draw practical benefit.</p>

<p class="indent">You may think, my dear friend, that I could not occupy
myself with subjects, without endeavouring to analyse my own portion of
courage; for who can undertake to study mankind without beginning
and ending with himself? Are you curious to be informed on this
point? It is a ticklish thing; but you know that I have a pleasure in
being candid, and therefore willingly withdraw, at times, the curtains
of my most secret chamber, to afford my good friends a glimpse.
Listen, then: the result will be found in that admired <i>juste milieu</i>,
which certain well-known governments have discovered without
knowing it, and find that it answers admirably well, because it may
be translated by the German word <i>mittel mässigkeit</i> (moderation, or
mediocrity.) This is just the case with me also: in the first place, I
must own to the feminine temperament No. 2, although I would
rather have belonged to No. 1; however, laws are not to be prescribed
to the Creator; and to say of myself what I think, without
maintaining it as certainly demonstrated, would be too vain on my
part: fortunately, in addition to my mediocre No. 2, I possess <i>a</i>,
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, thoroughly, at least in a high,
if not in the highest degree.</p>

<p class="indent">I know the nervous agitation which in some is called
bashfulness, and in others fear, as do many who would not perhaps admit
it so candidly; but it does not conquer me, and acts merely as a shower
of rain does on a man wrapped in a waterproof cloak; the water
remains on the surface, and does not penetrate. I have before signified
that physical conditions, that is, stronger or weaker condition of
the nerves, produce great variations, particularly in the dispositions
1 and 2. The advantageous effect of a good breakfast on the courage
has become proverbial among the French; and all those who are in
the least "nervous" must acknowledge that there is a good deal of
truth in it. The young libertine in Gil Blas was perfectly in the right
to answer, when he was called at five in the morning to fight a duel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
"That he would not rise at such an hour for a rendezvous with a
lady, much less to have his throat cut by a man;" at eleven o'clock,
when he had breakfasted, and was thoroughly awake&mdash;not before&mdash;he
got up, went out, and was run through the body: a strong illustration
of the folly of getting up, too soon. However, when it must
be, the admirable <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, can conquer even distasteful
fasting, as they can everything else, whether they act together or singly: with
the help of this <i>æs triplex</i>, my littleness has fought its way very
comfortably through the world, as I hope it will continue to do, without
any great injury accruing, or being likely to accrue, to my vanity, my
sense of honour, or my sense of duty.</p>

<p class="indent">Being, in addition, half poet and half enthusiast, even the
courage of rashness was not unknown to me in my youthful days; notwithstanding
which, it is possible that, without my <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
I might have run away when it was dangerous to stay.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Now that I have grown up a civilised man, I observe
one peculiar shade. In danger, I think far less, sometimes not at all, of the danger
itself; but I am <i>afraid of my fear</i>; that is, I am afraid that others
should observe I am not quite so much at my ease, as my vanity and
my sense of honour (duty has nothing to do with it) require I should
be. At the very moment of danger, this feeling, as well as every
other that can be called anxiety, ceases of itself; because action makes
stronger claims on the spirit's strength, and the weaker affections fall
naturally into the background. This weakness (for such it certainly
is) of extreme anxiety respecting the opinion of men, is so characteristic
of me, that I feel it continually whenever I am called upon to
do anything that brings me under observation,&mdash;for example, whether
I make a speech, act a part, or encounter mortal danger. Herewith
must not, however, be reckoned more or less physical excitement, or
when natural impulses such as I, II, III, come into play. I can, without
boasting, affirm, with a good conscience, that the mortal danger
is, in relation to the others, the lightest of the three; and you will
laugh when I tell you, that the strongest fit of timidity that ever
seized upon me was, absurdly enough, on one occasion when I was
to <i>sing</i> in public!&mdash;an unlucky passion that possessed me at one time
in my foolish life, and which I renounced merely out of vexation at
this ridiculous bashfulness. If I were writing about another, I should,
out of civility, call such a disposition, only an exaggerated sense of
honour,&mdash;at most vanity, well-founded vanity. But I dare not flatter
myself, and therefore I give it its true name,&mdash;the fear of men; for
bashfulness is a part of fear, as audacity is of courage, but of courage,
so to say, without soul, consequently without dignity, as bashfulness
is fear without shame. It must not be overlooked that the greatest
courage cannot, at the bottom, dispense with audacity, and the
greatest men in profane history possessed it. It is, however, one of
the greatest gifts for the world; and many deceive through their
whole lives, by the help of audacity alone. It is not necessary to say
that it must, however, be coupled with understanding, and so applied
as we must in public go decently clothed. I am sorry that I have
it not, and can only obtain it by artificial means; but it appears to me
of so much importance, that I am half inclined, dear Schefer, to
favour you with a second dissertation, if it were not a principal
maxim of my book and letter-writing trade not to give too much of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
what is valuable. You are quit for the fear this time; and, as you
are but too well acquainted with me, I see you smile, and hear you
distinctly exclaim, "Another fancy-piece to look like truth." My
dear Schefer, a good conjurer shows all the cards, and yet you only
see what he pleases to let you. You and the Secret Society understand
me. Like Wallenstein, I keep my last word <i>in petto</i>.
This is my last but one.</p>

<h2>THE COBBLER OF DORT.</h2>
<p class="f90">BY THE AUTHOR OF "<b>MEPHISTOPHELES IN ENGLAND</b>."</p>

<span class="i10">"Oh! the world's nothing more than a cobbler's stall,</span>
<span class="i12">Stitch, stitch, hammer, hammer, hammer!</span>
<span class="i10">And mankind are the boots and the shoes on the wall;</span>

<p class="indent">"Jacob!&mdash;Jacob Kats, I say!" exclaimed a shrill female voice.</p>

<p class="indent">"Stitch, stitch, hammer, hammer, hammer!" continued the singer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Are you deaf, mynheer?"</p>

<p class="indent">"And mankind are the boots and the shoes on the wall."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do leave off your singing, and open the door; the burgomaster
will be angry that I have stayed so long."</p>

<p class="indent">"Stitch, stitch, hammer, hammer, hammer!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You are enough to provoke the most patient girl in Dort.
Open the door, Jacob Kats! Open the door this instant, or you shall never
have any more work from me!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ya?" drawled the cobbler interrogatively, as he slowly
opened the door of his stall.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is this the way you behave to your customers, mynheer?" asked
a smartly-dressed, plump-faced, pretty little woman, in rather a sharp
tone;&mdash;"keeping them knocking at the door till you please to open
it? It's not respectful to the burgomaster, Jacob Kats!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ya!" replied the mender of leather.</p>

<p class="indent">"Here, I want you to do this very neatly," said the girl, producing
a small light shoe, and pointing to a place that evidently wanted repairing.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ya!" said Jacob Kats, examining with professional
curiosity the object spoken of.</p>

<p class="indent">"The stitches have broken away, you see; so you must fill up
the place they have left, with your best workmanship," she continued.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ya!" he responded.</p>

<p class="indent">"And mind you don't make a botch of it, mynheer!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ya!"</p>

<p>"And let me have it in an hour, for the burgomaster has given me leave to go to a dance."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ya!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"And be sure you make a reasonable charge."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ya."</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall be back in an hour," said the little woman, as
she opened the door to let herself out of the stall; "and I shall expect
that it will be ready by that time:" and away she went. "Ya!" replied
Jacob for the last time, as he prepared to set briskly about the job,
knowing that his fair customer was too important a personage to be
disappointed. "It is not every cobbler that can boast of being employed
by a burgomaster's nursery-maid," thought Jacob; and Jacob was right.</p>

<p class="indent">Now every one knows what sort of character a cobbler is; but
a Dutch cobbler is the <i>beau idéal</i> of the tribe, and the cobbler of Dort
deserved to be king of all the cobblers in Holland. He was the
finest specimen of "the profession" it was possible to meet with; a
profession, by-the-by, which his forefathers from time immemorial had
followed, for none of them had ever been, or ever aspired to be, shoemakers.
Jacob could not be said to be tall, unless a height of five feet
one is so considered. His body was what is usually called "punchy;"
his head round like a ball, so that it appeared upon his shoulders like
a Dutch cheese on a firkin of butter; and his face, having been well
seamed by the ravages of the small-pox, closely resembled a battered
nutmeg-grater, with a tremendous gap at the bottom for a mouth,
a fiery excrescence just above it, for a nose, and two dents, higher
still, in which were placed a pair of twinkling eyes. It will easily be
understood from this description, that our hero was by no means
handsome; but his father and his grandfather before him, had been
remarkable for the plainness of their looks, and therefore Jacob had
no earthly reason to desire to put a better face on his business than
his predecessors. Much cannot be said of his dress, which had little
in it differing from that of other cobblers. A red woollen cap ornamented
his head,&mdash;a part of his person that certainly required some
decoration; long sleeves, of a fabric which could only be guessed at,
in consequence of their colour, cased his arms; half-a-dozen waistcoats
of various materials covered the upper part of his body; and
his nether garments were hid under an immense thick leather
apron,&mdash;a sort of heir-loom of the family.</p>

<p class="indent">But Jacob had other <i>habits</i> beside these; he drank
much&mdash;he smoked more&mdash;and had an equal partiality for songs and
pickled herrings. Alone, which is something like a paradox, he was the most
sociable fellow in existence; he sang to himself, he talked to himself,
he drank to himself, and was evidently on the most friendly terms
with himself: but when any one made an addition to the society,
he became the most reserved of cobblers; monosyllables were all he
attempted to utter; nor had he any great variety of these, as may have
been observed in the preceding dialogue. His stall was his kingdom;
he swayed his hammer, and ruled his lapstone vigorously; and, as other
absolute monarchs have done,&mdash;in his subjects he found his <i>tools</i>.
His place of empire was worthy of its ruler. It had originally been an
outhouse, belonging to one of those low Gothic-looking dwellings with
projecting eaves and bow windows that may be seen in the unfashionable
parts of most Dutch towns; and its interior, besides a multitude
of objects belonging to the trade, contained a variety of other matters
peculiar to himself. Such spaces on the wells as were not hidden
from view by superannuated boots and shoes, were covered with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
coloured prints from designs by Ostade, Teniers, and others, representing
boors drinking, playing at cards or at bowls, and similar
subjects. On a heavy three-legged stool, the throne of the dynasty
of the Kats, sat the illustrious Jacob, facing the window to receive
all the advantages the light could give: before him were the paraphernalia
of his vocation: on one side was a curious old flask, smelling
strongly of genuine Schiedam, which invariably formed "a running
accompaniment" to his labours; and on the other was an antique
pipe, short in the stem, and having a bowl on which the head
of a satyr had been carved, but constant use for several generations
had made the material so black, that it might have been taken for
the frontispiece of a more objectionable personage.</p>

<p class="indent">Jacob Kats had been diligently waxing some flax preparatory
to commencing the repairs of the burgomaster's nursery-maid's shoe,
occasionally stopping in his task to moisten his throat with the
contents of the flask, which, either from a prodigal meal of pickled
herrings having made him more thirsty than usual, or the Schiedam
appearing more excellent, had been raised to his mouth so often that
day, that it had tinged his nose to a more luminous crimson, and had
given to his eyes a more restless twinkling, than either had known
for some time; when, having prepared his thread, laid it carefully on
his knee ready for immediate use, and placed the object on which
his skill was to be exercised close at hand, he turned his attention to
his pipe,&mdash;it being an invariable rule of his progenitors never to
attempt anything of importance without first seeking the stimulating
influence of the Virginian weed. On examining his stock of tobacco,
he discovered that he had barely enough for one pipe.</p>

<p class="indent">"Donner und blitzen! no more? Bah! I wish to the Teufel my
pipe would never want refilling," exclaimed the cobbler of Dort, filling
the bowl with the remains of the tobacco; and then, having ignited it
with the assistance of flint, steel, and German tinder, puffed away at
the tube, consoling himself with the reflection that, when his labour
was done, he should be able to procure a fresh supply. He smoked
and stitched, and stitched and smoked, and smoked and stitched
again, and, while his fumigations kept pace with his arms, his
thoughts were by no means idle; for, to tell the exact truth, he became
conscious of a flow of ideas more numerous and more ambitious
than he had ever previously conceived. Among other notions
which hurried one another through his pericranium, was one particularly
interesting to himself. He thought it was high time to
attempt something to prevent the ancient family of the Kats becoming
extinct, as he was now on the shady side of forty, enjoying
in single blessedness the dignities of Cobbler of Dort, and, if such a
state continued, stood an excellent chance of being the last of his
name who had filled that honourable capacity. He could not help
condemning the taste of the girls of his native town, who had never
looked favourably upon his advantages: even Maria Van Bree, a fair
widow who had signified her affection every day for fifteen years by
repeating a joke upon his nose, only last week had blighted his
dearest hopes by marrying an old fellow with no nose at all. Jacob
thought of his solitary condition, and fancied himself miserable.
He became sentimental. His stitches were made with a melancholy
precision, and in the intensity of his affliction he puffed his miserable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
pipe; but, as song was the medium through which he always expressed
his emotions, his grief was not tuneless: in tones that, without
any exaggeration, were wretched to a degree, he sung the following
exquisite example of Dutch sentiment:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ach! had ik tranen kon ik schreijen,</span>
<span class="i2">De smart knaagt mij het leven af;</span>
<span class="i0">Neen wanhoop spaargeen folte ringen,</span>
<span class="i2">Stort bij Maria mij in't graf."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Which is most appropriately rendered thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah! had I tears, so fast they'd spring,</span>
<span class="i2">Nought from these eyes the flood could wipe out;</span>
<span class="i0">But had I songs, I could not sing,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">The false Maria's put my pipe out."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The conclusion of this pathetic verse brought to his mind
the extraordinary circumstance of his pipe (the one he had been smoking)
continuing to be vigorously puffed long after it had usually required
replenishing. He might have exhausted three in the same time.
He also became conscious of a curious burning sensation spreading
from immediately under his red cap to the very extremities of his
ten toes. The smoke he inhaled seemed very hot; and the alarm
which his observations on these matters created was considerably
increased by hearing a roar of small shrill laughter burst from under
his very nose!</p>

<p class="indent">"Donner und blitzen!" exclaimed the bewildered cobbler,
as he took the pipe out of his mouth and looked around him to discover
from whence the sounds proceeded.</p>

<p class="indent">"Smoke away, old boy! Smoke away! You won't smoke me
out in a hurry, I can tell ye."</p>

<p class="indent">Jacob directed his eyes to the place from whence came this
strange address, and his astonishment may be imagined at perceiving that
<i>the words were uttered by his pipe!</i> The ill-looking, black satyr,
carved on the bowl, seemed to cock his eye at him in the most impertinent
manner, twisted his mouth into all sorts of diabolical grimaces,
and laughed till the tears ran down his sooty cheeks. Jacob
was, as he himself expressed it, "struck all of a heap."</p>

<p class="indent">"You know you wished to the Teufel your pipe would never
require refilling," said the voice as plainly as it could, while laughing
all the time; "so your desire is now gratified. You may smoke me
till the day of judgement."</p>

<p class="indent">Jacob, in fear and trembling, recalled to mind his impious
wish; and even his regret for having been jilted by the widow Van Bree
was forgotten in the intensity of his alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">"Smoke away, Jacob Kats!&mdash;I'm full of capital tobacco,"
continued the little wretch, with a chuckle.</p>

<p class="indent">The terrified cobbler was thinking of refusing, yet too
much afraid of the consequences; while his tormentor, distorting his hideous
features into a more abominable grin, shrieked out in his shrill treble,</p>

<p class="indent">"You <i>must</i> smoke me&mdash;no use refusing <i>now</i>!
Here I am, old boy, with a full bowl that will never burn out&mdash;never,
never, never! so you'd best smoke." And then, as if noticing his indecision,
he exclaimed, with a fresh burst of horrid laughter, "Well, if you won't,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
I'll make you: so, here goes!" and, before his wretched victim was
aware of the manoeuvre, he jumped stem foremost into his mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, smoke away, old boy, or worse will follow!"
said the little satyr threateningly.</p>

<p class="indent">Jacob was in such a state of fright that he did not dare
to refuse; but the first mouthful of smoke he inhaled seemed to choke him,
as if it was the burning flames of sulphur, and, gasping for breath, he
brushed the pipe from his mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">"Smoke away, Jacob!&mdash;capital tobacco!" screamed the
voice in a roar of more fiendish mirth, as he immediately regained his position.
In vain, with one hand after the other, the miserable cobbler knocked
the pipe from between his teeth: as fast as he struck it away, it
returned to the same place. "Smoke away, old boy!" continued his
unrelenting enemy, as often as his fits of laughter would allow.
"Smoke away!&mdash;capital tobacco!"</p>

<p class="indent">Jacob Kats seemed in despair, when, casting his eyes upon
his lapstone, a way of getting rid of the accursed pipe presented itself to
his mind. He threw down the grinning demon on the floor, and with
his lapstone raised above his head was about to crush it at a blow.
"Smoke away, old boy!" fixing itself again firmly between his teeth,
before Jacob had time to put his intention into execution, jeeringly
continued the detested voice; "smoke away!&mdash;capital tobacco!"</p>

<p class="indent">With one great effort, such as great minds have recourse
to on great occasions. Jacob let fall the stone, with a vigorous grasp
caught hold of the grinning pipe, and, as he thought, before it could
make a guess as to what he was about to do, dashed it into a thousand
pieces upon the lapstone at his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">"Donner und blitzen!" cried the delighted cobbler;
"I have done for you now!"</p>

<p class="indent">Alas for all sublunary pleasures!&mdash;alas for all worldly
convictions!&mdash;instead of his enemy being broken into a thousand pieces, it
was multiplied into a thousand pipes,&mdash;every one a facsimile of the original,
each possessing the same impertinent cock of the eye, each
disclosing the same satirical twist of the mouth, and all laughing like
a troop of hyenas, and shouting in chorus, "Smoke away! smoke
away, old boy!&mdash;capital tobacco!"</p>

<p class="indent">The patience of a Dutchman may be great, but the concentrated
patience of all Holland could not stand unmoved on so trying an
occasion as that which occurred to Jacob Kats. He saw his multitudinous
tormentors form into regular rank and file, and then, as if
his mouth had been a breach which he had "armed to the teeth,"
they presented their stems like so many bayonets, and charged in
military fashion, screaming, laughing, and shouting, in a manner
sufficiently terrible to scare the senses out of all the cobblers in
Christendom. Slowly the trembling wretch retreated before the
threatening phalanx; but he was surrounded&mdash;his back was against
the wall&mdash;there was no escape; and with one leap the enemy were
in the citadel. Extraordinary as it may appear, Jacob did not lose
his presence of mind. As they were all jostling, and giggling, and
crying out to be smoked, the unconquered cobbler firmly grasped the
whole mass of his foes in both his hands to make a last attempt at
their destruction, by throwing them into a tub of water, in which he
soaked his leather, that happened to be just within reach; but, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
a manner inexplicable to him, he felt that the more vigorously he
grasped them in a body, the more rapidly they seemed to shrink
from his touch, till nothing was left but the original pipe, which
suddenly slipped out of his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well then, you <i>won't</i> smoke me," coolly remarked the
sooty demon;&mdash;"but," added he, in tones that made the marrow in Jacob's
bones turn cold as ice, "<span class="smcap">I'll smoke you!</span>"</p>

<p class="indent">While the last of the family of the Kats was reflecting upon
the meaning of those mysterious words, to his increasing horror he observed
the well-smoked features of the satyr gradually swell into an
enormous bulk of countenance, as the same process of enlargement
transformed the stem into legs, arms, and body, proportionately huge
and terrific; but the monstrous face still wore its original expression,
and seemed to the unhappy Dutchman as if he was looking at the
cock of his eye through a microscope. Without saying a word, the
monster, with the finger and thumb of his right hand, caught up
Jacob Kats by the middle, just as an ordinary man would take up an
ordinary pipe, and with his left hand twisted one of his victim's legs
over the other, as if they had been made of wax, till they came to a
tolerable point at the foot; then, taking from a capacious pocket at
his side a moderate-sized piece of tobacco, with the utmost impudence
imaginable, he rubbed it briskly upon Jacob's unfortunate nose,
which, as would any fiery nose under such circumstances, was burning
with indignation; and the weed immediately igniting, as the poor
cobbler lay with his head down gasping for breath, he thrust the
flaming mass into his mouth, extended a pair of jaws that looked like
the lock of the Grand Canal, quietly raised Jacob's foot between
them, and immediately began to smoke with the energy of a steam-engine!
Miserable Jacob Kats!&mdash;what agonies he endured! At
every whiff the inhuman smoker took, he could feel the narcotic
vapour, hot as a living coal, drawn rapidly down his throat, through
his veins and out at his toes, to be puffed in huge volumes out of the
monster's mouth, till the place was filled with the smoke. Jacob felt
that his teeth were red-hot,&mdash;that his tongue was a cinder,&mdash;and
big drops of perspiration coursed each other down his burning cheeks,
like the waves of the Zuyder Zee on the shore when the tide's
running up. Jacob looked pitiably at his tormentor, and thought he
discerned a glimpse of relenting in the atrocious ugliness of his
physiognomy. He unclosed his enormous jaws, and removed from them
the foot of his victim. The cobbler of Dort congratulated himself
on the approach of his release.</p>

<p class="indent">"Jacob Kats, my boy!" exclaimed the giant, in that quiet
patronising kind of voice all great men affect, carelessly balancing Jacob
on his finger and thumb at a little distance from his mouth, as he threw
out a long wreath of acrid smoke; "Jacob, you are a capital pipe,&mdash;there's
no denying <i>that</i>. You smoke admirably,&mdash;take my word for
it;" and then, without a word of pity or consolation, he resumed his
unnatural fumigations with more fierceness than ever. Jacob had
behaved like a martyr,&mdash;he had shown a spirit worthy of the Kats in
their best days; but the impertinence of such conduct was not to be
endured. He would a minute since have allowed himself to have
been dried into a Westphalia ham, to which state he had been rapidly
progressing, but the insult he had just received had roused the dormant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
spirit of resistance in his nature; and, while every feature in
his tyrant's smoky face seemed illuminated with a thousand sardonic
grins, having no better weapon at hand, Jacob hastily snatched the
red cap off his head, and, taking deliberate aim at his persecutor,
flung it bang into the very cock of his eye. The monster opened his
jaws to utter a yell of agony, and down came the head of Jacob Kats
upon the floor, that left him without sense or motion.</p>

<p class="indent">How long the cobbler of Dort remained in this unenviable
situation it is impossible to say, but he was first recalled to consciousness
by a loud knocking at the door of his stall.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">"Jacob! Jacob Kats!" exclaimed the well-known
voice of his fair customer, in a tone of considerable impatience; and Jacob,
raising himself on his elbows, discovered that he had fallen back off his stool;
and the empty flask at his side, and the unfinished work on his lap,
while they gave him a tolerably correct notion of his condition, did
not suggest any remedy for the fatal consequences of disappointing
the burgomaster's nursery-maid. It is only necessary to add, that,
with considerable difficulty, he managed to satisfy his important
patroness; but, to the very day of his death, Jacob, who proved to be
the last of the long dynasty of Kats who enjoyed the dignity inseparable
from the situation of Cobbler of Dort, could not, with any
degree of satisfaction, make up his mind as to whether the strange
effects he had that eventful day experienced had been caused by
extraordinary indulgence in the luxury of pickled herrings,&mdash;or too
prodigal allowance of Schiedam,&mdash;or intense disappointment for the
loss of the widow Van Bree.</p>

<h2>THE ADMIRABLE CRICHTON.</h2>

<p class="blockquot space-above1"><b>"Signor Giacomo caro, non vi accorgete che
sete un giovane senza pare? Nobile, bello, dotto, e robusto, ed alto quasi
egualmente, or lingua or mano ad oprando, a dire e fare ogni bene?"</b></p>

<p class="indent">So, in or about the year of Grace 1582, wrote Sperone Speroni
the Paduan, to James Crichton the Scotchman:</p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>"Dear James, do you not know that you have no equal? Noble,
handsome, learned, and robust,&mdash;equally apt to use the tongue or the
hand,&mdash;to say or to do what is excellent?"</b></p>

<p class="indent">There cannot be the smallest doubt that James knew all
this himself; and now, since the appearance of Mr. Ainsworth's romance, all
the world knows it. Wherefore, as the Admirable has suddenly become
an object of admiration, we are moved to say a few words about him.</p>

<p class="indent">A number of learned people, remarkable chiefly for the
dullness of their learning, have on various occasions undertaken to prove
the egregious quackery and pretension of the famous Scot. Such-like
people are, naturally enough, given to such researches; for they cannot
endure in any shape the rebuke of an obvious superiority. "How
now, thou particular fellow?" said Jack Cade to the man who sought
to recommend himself on the score of being able to write and read;
and, "How now, thou particular fellow?" is the exclamation of
plodding pedants to the illustrious Crichton, when, instead of approaching
them covered with the dust of folios, he bounds into their
presence beaming with grace and beauty, the idol of the gay and the
young, the observed of all observers, crowned with the favours of women,
and followed by the applauding shouts of men!</p>

<p class="indent">We are not pedants, and therefore we have faith in Crichton.
How otherwise? In philosophy and learning was he not a Bayle's Dictionary?
In the universality of his literary accomplishments, a perfect
Bentley's Miscellany? Who shall impugn the opinions of the
most classic time of Scotland, or set up his dogmas against the generous
acknowledgments of Italy in her golden day? And was not
Crichton so beautiful in body only because he was in mind so beautiful;&mdash;for,
where true beauty exists, who would separate body from mind?
Shade of the Admirable, forgive your poor detractors, for the sake of
the true worship your memory has inspired! It was natural that to
the sight of many men, before whom in life you strode on so far, you
should have dwindled in the distance; but now, after many years,
you reappear again, graceful as ever in form, and wonderful in
accomplishments. We hail you as we should some missing star that once
more "swims into our ken!"</p>

<p class="indent">And what sort of fame is that, the reader possibly asks,
which may seek from the hands of some novelist or romancer its privilege of
continuance in the mouths of men? Let that reader first ask himself
how many brilliant actions there are which pass away and are forgotten&mdash;while
a thousandth part of the effort that produced them,
embodied in a few words, might have lived for ever. It was the
remark of an old writer, that words harden into substances, while
bodies moulder away into air. Even Cæsar and Alexander weigh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
little in comparison with Virgil and Homer. Now Crichton might
have been a Cæsar or an Alexander, if he had had legions at his
back; or, without the legions, if his youth had been allowed to ripen
into age. The great principle of his being was a stirring and irrepressible
activity. His learning was as prodigious as his accomplishments;
but how, in the short six or seven years of his public life,
could he have exhibited them to the admiration of Europe, if he had
set to work in the fashion of the schoolmen? With a probable forecast
of his early doom, he bethought himself of a different way. He
made up for the brevity of his life, by its brightness. He kindled all
its fires at once. Resolved to abate no single particle of his brilliancy
among the great men of his time, he rose at once to the topmost
height of his possible achievements, careless whether he should fall
among posterity, dark as a spent rocket, and recognizable by a few
fragments of faded paper only. But what of that? What he designed
to do, he did. He struck the blow he had desired to strike.
And which of the Great Men has done more? How many have done
lamentably less! We see the beauty and the learning of Crichton
reflected back from the most intellectual minds of the greatest day
that ever shone upon Scotland or Italy. What nobler mirror?</p>

<p class="indent">Justly Mr. Ainsworth remarks&mdash;"It is from the effect produced
upon his contemporaries, and <i>such</i> contemporaries, that we can form
a just estimate of the extent of Crichton's powers. By them he was
esteemed a miracle of learning&mdash;<i>divinum planè juvenem</i>: and we
have an instance in our own times of a great poet and philosopher,
whose published works scarcely bear out the high reputation he enjoyed
for colloquial ability. The idolized friend of Aldus Manutius,
of Lorenzo Massa, Giovanni Donati, and Sperone Speroni, amongst
the must accomplished scholars of their age,&mdash;the antagonist of the
redoubted Arcangelus Mercenarius and Giacomo Mazzoni, men who
had sounded all the depths of philosophy,&mdash;could not have been other
than an extraordinary person." The allusion to Coleridge here is
not altogether out of place. Coleridge, like Crichton, though in a
humbler sphere, preferred prompt payment to the tardy waiting for
posterity. With both it was in some sort necessary that the effort
and the applause should go together. To Coleridge, for instance, so
strong had this habit of excessive talking become, even the certainty
of seeing what he wrote in print the next day was too remote a stimulus
for his imagination; and it was a constant practice of his to lay
aside his pen in the middle of an article, if a friend happened to drop
in upon him, and to finish the subject more effectually aloud, so that
the approbation of his hearer and the sound of his own voice might
be co-instantaneous. But what would Coleridge have done, if, besides
having to write an article for the Courier, in which he was to unravel
some transcendentalism about humanity and universal brotherhood into
a slavish support of the Allies&mdash;(a difficult task we admit),&mdash;if, besides
this, the ball-room, the ladies' chamber, the hunting-fields, the riding-house,
the lists at the Louvre, and some profoundly learned controversies
with the doctors of Navarre or Padua, had all, nearly at the
same instant, awaited him? Poor Coleridge would have died at
twenty, untouched by opium, and unknown, except by the admiring
testimonies of his less accomplished contemporaries.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Ainsworth has omitted, by-the-by, a very characteristic,
and, we think, a very decisive opinion of Crichton, by the famous Joseph
Scaliger. "He was a man of very wonderful genius," observes that
laborious and self-satisfied person; "but he had something of the
coxcomb about him. He wanted a little common sense." Here
is an unbiassed opinion. What Joseph means by the coxcombry
is obvious enough. Why, thinks Joseph, should a scholar have cheerfulness
of blood? All the women ran after Crichton,&mdash;a most indecorous
thing, and a certain evidence of coxcombry to a person who
cannot get a woman to run after him,&mdash;"Nor were the young unmarried
ladies," as Sir Thomas Urquhart remarks in his jewel of a
book, "of all the most eminent places of Italy anything respected of
one another, that had not either a lock of Crichtown's haire, or a copy
of verses of his composing." Who doubts his coxcombry, or that it
was other than a very delightful thing in him?</p>

<p class="indent">A want of common sense, in Scaliger's notion, was probably
an over supply of modesty. Nothing is so remarkable in Crichton as the
modesty which in him united with the most perfect confidence. He
proved that a coxcomb and a confident man may possess the truest
modesty. There is a charming anecdote told of him at a great levee
of learned men in Padua, where, having exposed the errors of the
school of Aristotle with equal solidity, modesty, and acuteness, and
perceiving that the enthusiasm of his audience was carrying them
too far in admiration of himself, he suddenly changed his tone, assumed
an extreme playfulness of manner, and declaimed in exquisite
phrase upon the <i>happiness of ignorance</i>. Nothing could
have been so perfectly devised to self-check any exuberance of pride.
But in all things his modesty was remarkable, when taken in connexion
with his extraordinary powers. Observe it in the circumstance
of his melancholy death, where a romantic sense of what was
due to his prince and master induced him to throw aside his unmatchable
skill, and present himself naked and defenceless to the
dagger of an assassin. This was not weakness in Crichton. Himself
the descendant of rulers of the earth, of princes and bishops,&mdash;(shall
we ever forget that perfect model of ecclesiastical fitness, Bishop
George Crichton of Dunkeld, "a man nobly disposed, very hospitable,
and a magnificent housekeeper, but in matters of religion not
much skilled"?)&mdash;a weak and unmanly feeling would have given him
presumption, not deference,&mdash;would have thrown insult in the face of
Gonzaga, and not ill-required chivalry at his feet.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">But what more need we say of Crichton? Have not
three volumes of brilliant writing been just devoted to the delineation of two
days of his matchlessly brilliant life? We may refer the reader, whether he
is curious after the Admirable Crichton, or after his own amusement
solely, to William Harrison Ainsworth's last romance. An expression
of character equally poetic and dramatic, a rich glow of colouring
which diffuses itself through every part of the work, and a generally
easy and effective style, have secured for this book a high and permanent
place in the literature of fiction.</p>

<h2>MEMOIRS OF SHERIDAN.</h2>

<p class="indent">Though it may appear paradoxical to say so, yet there is
no more melancholy reading than the biography of a celebrated wit. In nine
out of ten cases, what is such a memoir other than a record of acute
suffering, the almost inseparable attendant of that thoughtless and
mercurial temperament which cannot, or will not, conform to the
staid usages society; which makes ten enemies where it makes
one friend; is engaged in a constant warfare with common sense,
and lives for the day, letting the morrow shift for itself? Instances
there are of prosperous wits, such as Congreve, Pope, and some others
that we could mention, whose singular tact and provident habits have
preserved them from the usual fate of their fraternity; but these
instances are rare: the majority, though enjoying, it is true, their sunny
hours, and realising for a brief season their most brilliant hopes,
have struggled through life a prey to the bitterest disappointments.</p>

<p class="indent">The life of Sheridan will go far to verify these cursory
remarks. No wit ever enjoyed more intoxicating successes, or suffered more
humiliating reverses. He had frequent opportunities of realising a
handsome independence; but, with that recklessness and inattention
to the business of life peculiar to such natures as his, he flung away
all his chances, and died a beggar, deserted by almost all his old
associates, his celebrity on the wane, and his character under a cloud.
Never was there a more impressive homily than his death-bed inculcates;
it speaks to the heart, like the closing scene of "great Villiers,"
and is worth all the sermons that ever were preached from the
pulpit.</p>

<p class="indent">Many, however, of poor Sheridan's defects seem to have
descended to him as a sort of heir-loom from his ancestors. His grandfather,
Dr. Sheridan, the friend and butt of Swift, though an amiable, was a
singularly reckless and improvident man; and his father, the well-known
teacher of elocution, is mentioned more then once by Johnson
as being remarkable for nothing so much as his "wrong-headedness."
It is but justice, however, to this individual to state, that by fits and
starts he paid every attention to his son's education that his straitened
means and capricious temper would allow. In the year 1758,
when young Sheridan had just completed his seventh year, he sent
him to a private school in Dublin, whence, at the expiration of fourteen
months, he brought him over with him to England, and placed
him at Harrow, under the care of Dr. Sumner. From this period to
the day of his death, the subject of our memoir never again beheld
his native city.</p>

<p class="indent">Sheridan had not been long at Harrow when he attracted the
favourable notice of Dr. Parr, at that time one of the head-masters of
the establishment, who, perceiving in him unquestionable evidences
of superior capacity, did all he could to stimulate him to exertion.
But his endeavours were fruitless, for the boy was incorrigibly idle,
though a general favourite by reason of his good-humour and the
social turn of his mind,&mdash;and left Harrow at the age of eighteen, with
a slender amount of Latin and less Greek, but at the same time with
a very fair acquaintance with the lighter branches of English literature.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">In the year 1770, Sheridan accompanied his family to Bath,
which was then what Cheltenham and Brighton now are,&mdash;the head-quarters
of gaiety and dissipation. Here he promptly signalised himself, after
the usual Irish fashion, by an elopement and two duels; thus literally
fighting his way to celebrity! The young lady who was the cause of
these sprightly sallies was Miss Linley, daughter of the eminent musician
of that name, and one of the most beautiful women of her day.
At the time when Sheridan first became acquainted with her she was
but sixteen, the favourite vocalist at the Bath concerts, and the
standing toast of all the wits and gallants of the city. It is to the
impassioned feelings which the charms of this lovely girl called forth
in his breast that we owe our hero's first decided plunge into unequivocal
poetry. Having on one occasion&mdash;for the families of the young
couple were in habits of strict intimacy&mdash;presumed to offer her some
sober counsel, she resented his officiousness, and a quarrel took place
between them, which was not made up till Sheridan sent some
stanzas of a most penitential character, by way of a peace-offering.
We subjoin a specimen or two of this poem, which evinces unquestionable
feeling, but is deformed, as was the fashion of those days, by
tawdry and puerile conceits:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, this is the grotto where Delia reclined,</span>
<span class="i2">As late I in secret her confidence sought;</span>
<span class="i0">And this is the tree kept her safe from the wind,</span>
<span class="i2">As blushing she heard the grave lesson I taught.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then tell me, thou grotto of moss-covered stone,</span>
<span class="i2">And tell me, thou willow, with leaves dripping dew,</span>
<span class="i0">Did Delia seem vexed when Horatio was gone,</span>
<span class="i2">And did she confide her resentment to you?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Methinks now each bough, as you're waving it, tries</span>
<span class="i2">To whisper a cause for the sorrow I feel,</span>
<span class="i0">To hint how she frowned when I dared to advise,</span>
<span class="i2">And sighed when she saw that I did it with zeal.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">True, true, silly leaves, so she did, I allow;</span>
<span class="i2">She frowned, but no rage in her looks could I see;</span>
<span class="i0">She frowned, for reflection had clouded her brow;</span>
<span class="i2">She sighed, but perhaps 'twas in pity to me.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then wave thy leaves brisker, thou willow of woe,</span>
<span class="i2">I tell thee no rage in her looks I could see;</span>
<span class="i0">I cannot, I will not, believe it was so;</span>
<span class="i2">She was not, she could not, be angry with me.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For well did she know that my heart meant no wrong;</span>
<span class="i2">It sank at the thought but of giving her pain;</span>
<span class="i0">But trusted its task to a faltering tongue,</span>
<span class="i2">Which erred from the feelings it could not explain.</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Sentimental poetry, it is well known, has a great effect
in softening the female heart; and Sheridan soon succeeded in sonnetteering
Miss Linley into sympathy. He had, however, a sturdy opponent to contend
against in the person of Captain Mathews, a married man, of
specious address and persevering gallantry. This <i>roué</i> beset the fair
vocalist in every possible way, and, when mildly but firmly repulsed,
threw out a menace of attacking her good fame. Alarmed at this
unmanly threat, and at the consequences of her father's indignation
should the captain's dishonourable proposals become known to him,
Miss Linley had recourse to Sheridan, who instantly advised her to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
accept of his escort to France, where he promised that he would
place her under the secure protection of a convent. With some hesitation
she complied with his advice, assisted not a little in her resolution
by the repugnance which she had long entertained to her
profession; and the parties set out for Calais, accompanied by a third
person, a female, by way of chaperon.</p>

<p class="indent">On reaching the place of their destination, Sheridan at once
threw off the mask of the friend, and, addressing Miss Linley as the lover,
so worked upon her feelings by artful hints about the injury her
character would sustain, if she did not give him a legal title to protect
her, that she consented to a private marriage, which accordingly took
place in 1772, at a little village near Calais. The parties then made
the best of their way back to England where they returned to their
respective families; old Linley, from whom the marriage was kept a
profound secret, being, of course, not less incensed than surprised by
the, to him, unaccountable conduct of his daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Captain Mathews, on learning Miss Linley's
extraordinary flight, instantly made good his threat of defaming her character
in the local journals, for which he was twice called out by Sheridan,
who in the second duel received a wound which long confined him to
his bed. His situation at this period must have been one of extreme
uneasiness. He was separated from his wife, and was on ill terms
with his father, who, on his return from London shortly after the
catastrophe, refused to see him, and even went the length of forbidding
any of his family to hold the slightest intercourse with the Linleys.
A communication was nevertheless kept up between the lovers
through the agency of Sheridan's sisters, who had not the heart to
resist the imploring appeals of their brother.</p>

<p class="indent">In the autumn of 1772 the young Benedict was sent by his
father&mdash;who was anxious to detach him wholly from the Linleys&mdash;to
the house of a friend in Essex, where he remained for some months in
strict retirement, and spent much of his time in study. While here,
he paid occasional flying visits to London, for the purpose of seeing
his wife, who was then professionally engaged at the Covent Garden
oratorios; but, finding no means of procuring an interview with her,
so closely was she watched by her father, he more than once, it is
said, disguised himself as a hackney-coachman, for the sole pleasure
of driving her home from the theatre.</p>

<p class="indent">The time, however, was at hand when his perseverance was to
meet with its reward. Old Linley, finding that neither threat, supplication,
nor remonstrance could change the current of his daughter's affections
and that, by some mysterious process, letters from her husband
always found their way into her hands, at length gave his reluctant
consent to their union, and they were re-married, by licence, in 1773.</p>

<p class="indent">About this time Sheridan entered himself of the Middle Temple,
and took a small cottage at East Burnham, whither he retired immediately
after his marriage, with no other resources than his wife's
slender jointure and his own talents afforded him. Yet, though
cramped in his finances, he had the fortitude to resist all the golden
temptations which Mrs. Sheridan's musical abilities held out to him;
and withdrew her for ever from public life, resolving henceforth to be
himself the artificer of his own fortunes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">After a short stay at East Burnham, to which in after-years
he often looked back with regret as being the happiest period of his life,
Sheridan took a house in the neighbourhood of Portman-square, which
his father-in-law kindly furnished for him. Here he laboured with
great assiduity; wrote several political tracts, among which was a reply
to "Junius;" and completed his comedy of the "Rivals," which
was brought out at Covent Garden in the year 1775, and proved a
failure on its first representation, though it subsequently won its way
into public favour. The "Rivals" is a lively play, whose interest seldom
or never flags; is easy and graceful in its dialogue; and contains
one or two characters drawn with consummate skill. That of Falkland,
in particular,&mdash;the sensitive, wayward lover, the idea of which
was, no doubt, suggested by Sheridan's own personal experience,&mdash;is
a masterpiece; and not less effective is the sketch of Sir Anthony
Absolute. Mrs. Malaprop&mdash;an evident imitation of Fielding's Mrs.
Slip-slop&mdash;is a mere whimsical caricature; while, as respects Lydia
Languish, she is one of the insipid common-places to be picked up at
all watering-places, well delineated, it is true, but scarcely worth the
labour of delineation.</p>

<p class="indent">Sheridan's next production was "St. Patrick's Day;" a clever,
bustling farce, but bearing marks of haste and negligence. It was followed,
in the winter of 1775, by the well-known opera of the "Duenna,"
which at once obtained a popularity unexampled in the annals
of the drama. The plot of this delightful play is remarkable for the
tact with which it is conducted; the language is elegant, without being
too ornate or elaborate,&mdash;a very common defect in Sheridan's
dramas;&mdash;and the songs are prettily versified, which is the highest
praise we can accord them.</p>

<p class="indent">In the year 1776, on the retirement of Garrick from the
stage, Sheridan became one of the proprietors of Drury Lane Theatre. How,
or by whose assistance, he obtained the large sum&mdash;upwards of forty-five
thousand pounds&mdash;necessary to make this purchase, is a mystery
which none of his numerous biographers, with all their research and
ingenuity, have ever been able to fathom. We conclude it must have
been by that winning address, and the strenuous exercise of those unrivalled
powers of persuasion, which, at a later period, enabled Sheridan
to work a miracle,&mdash;that is, to soften the soul of an attorney!
It was in allusion to these fascinating powers that a rich City banker
once observed, "Whenever Sherry makes me a bow, it always costs
me a good dinner; and when he calls me 'Tom,' it is a full hundred
pounds out of my pocket!"</p>

<p class="indent">The year 1777 was rendered memorable by the production
of the "School for Scandal," which is incomparably the finest comedy of
which modern times can boast. Its success was proportionate to its
deserts. It completely took the town by storm. Nevertheless, transcendent
as are the excellencies of this brilliant play, it is not without
many and serious defects. Its dialogue is too studiously artificial; it
has little or no sustained interest of plot; and its characters&mdash;with the
exception of Charles Surface, whose airy, Mercutio-like vivacity conciliates
us in spite of ourselves&mdash;are such as them from first to last we regard
with indifference. The incessant dazzle of the language, however,&mdash;for
the "School for Scandal" is a perfect repertory of wit,&mdash;its
consummate polish, and the power of quick, apt repartee, that it
exhibits in every page, altogether blind us to its defects. The only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
play that can bear a comparison with it is Congreve's "Love for
Love," which shows an equal opulence of wit, and an equal sacrifice
to effect, of the free and easy play of nature.</p>

<p class="indent">Sheridan had now the ball at his feet. He was the lion of
the day, courted by all classes; the proprietor of the most thriving theatrical
establishment in London; and, could he but have been industrious,
and exercised ordinary forethought, he might have insured, not
merely what Thomson calls "an elegant sufficiency," but a splendid
independence for life. But indolence was his bane,&mdash;the fertile
source of all his errors and all his misfortunes,&mdash;the rock on which he
split,&mdash;the quicksand in which he was finally engulfed.</p>

<p class="indent">In the year following the production of the "School for Scandal,"
Sheridan brought out "The Critic,"&mdash;an admirable farce, the conception
of which is derived from the Duke of Buckingham's "Rehearsal."
The best character in this drama, and the most natural
and spirited ever drawn by its author, is that of Sir Fretful Plagiary,
which is supposed to have been meant for Cumberland, who witnessed
the representation from one of the side-boxes, and, being of an irritable,
tetchy temperament, must of course have been highly entertained.</p>

<p class="indent">We are now to regard Sheridan in a new character. Hitherto
we have seen him as the triumphant dramatist,&mdash;we are now to see him
as the triumphant orator. He had always, from his first entrance
into public life, had a strong predilection for politics; and the
acquaintance with Burke, Fox, Wyndham, and other eminent statesmen,
which he made at Johnson's Literary Club, decided him on
trying his chance in the House of Commons. Accordingly, in 1780,
he stood, and was returned, for Stafford; and made his first speech, as
an avowed partisan of Fox, in the November of that year, on the
presentation of a petition complaining of his undue election. Though he
was listened to with marked attention, yet so general was the impression
that he had failed, that the well-known printer, Woodfall, who
happened to be in the gallery at the time, said to him, as they quitted
the house together, "Oratory is not your forte; you had much better
have stuck to the drama;" on which Sheridan impatiently interrupted
him with, "It is in me, however, and, by G&mdash;! it shall come out."</p>

<p class="indent">But, despite this determined confidence in his own powers,
he did not for months afterwards take any active part in the debates; but,
when he did speak, spoke briefly and unassumingly, with a view, no
doubt, to feel his way. By this shrewd conduct he gained insensibly
on the good opinion of the house, and became at length so useful an
auxiliary to his party, that, on their accession to office in the year
1782, he was appointed one of the Under Secretaries of State; a snug,
easy post, but which he was compelled shortly to resign by the
sudden breaking up of the ministry, occasioned by the death of the
Marquis of Rockingham.</p>

<p class="indent">In the following year he was reinstated in office as Secretary
of the Treasury, a coalition having been formed between Lord North and
the Whigs, much against Sheridan's wishes; for he had the sagacity
to foresee that a junction of such discordant interests could have but
one termination; and the result proved that he was right. The
Coalition Ministry was speedily defeated, chiefly by the King's own
personal exertions; and the Under Secretary of the Treasury found
himself once again transported to that Siberia,&mdash;the Opposition bench.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Up to this period, Sheridan, though acknowledged to be
a skilful, ready debater, had not particularly distinguished himself in the
House; but the hour was approaching which was to draw forth all
his powers, and place him on the very highest pinnacle of oratorical
fame. In the year 1787, on the question of Warren Hastings' conduct
as Governor-general of India, he was chosen by his party to
bring forward in Parliament the charge relative to the Begum princesses
of Oude. His speech on this occasion produced an effect on
all who heard it, to which there is no parallel in the records of the
senate. It startled the House like a thunderbolt. Men of all parties
vied with each other in lavishing on it the most enthusiastic
praises. Burke declared it to be the "most astonishing effort of
eloquence, argument, and wit united, of which there was any record or
tradition." Fox said, "all that he had ever heard, all that he had
ever read, when compared with it, dwindled into nothing;" and Pitt&mdash;even
the cold, reserved Pitt&mdash;confessed that, in his opinion, "it
surpassed all the eloquence of ancient or modern times, and possessed
everything that genius or art could furnish, to agitate and control the
human mind." So intense, in short, was the sensation created by
this philippic, that the Minister actually moved an adjournment of
the debate, in order, as he observed, that honourable members might
have time to recover from the mental intoxication into which they
had been thrown by the spells of the enchanter!</p>

<p class="indent">Sheridan was now considered of so much consequence by the
Whig party, that when the trial of Warren Hastings was finally determined
on, he was appointed one of the managers to make good the articles
of impeachment; and brought forward in Westminster Hall,
before the most august assembly in the world, the same charge
which he had previously urged in the House of Commons. On this
occasion he spoke for four successive days, exciting, as before, the
astonishment and admiration of all his hearers. Fortunately this
celebrated oration, unlike the former one, has been preserved, and we
are therefore enabled to form a tolerable estimate of it. It contains
much brilliant wit, dexterous reasoning, and ready sarcasm; but is at
the same time defaced by the most tawdry, patchwork imagery.
Whenever Sheridan essays the poetic, he is invariably affected and
on stilts. He cannot soar, like Burke, into the empyreum; for he
had capacity, not imagination. His best passages are his most unlaboured
ones; but of these he seems to have thought least. He tricks
out superficial thoughts and obvious common-places in glittering
trope and metaphor; piles hyperbole on hyperbole, conceit on conceit;
and mistakes such showy, elaborate fustian for the true work of
the fancy. There is as much difference between the figurative composition
of Sheridan and that of Burke, as there is between specious
tinsel and sterling gold; yet, throughout the Westminster Hall
proceedings, the former appears to have thrown the latter completely
into the shade,&mdash;so apt is the world to be caught by the mere show
and glare of oratory!</p>

<p class="indent">The illness of his Majesty, George the Third, and the
discussion on the Regency question which took place in consequence, afforded
Sheridan numerous other opportunities of distinguishing himself in
Parliament. He espoused, of course, the side of the Prince of Wales,
whose confidence he soon gained, and at whose splendid entertainments
he was ever the favoured guest. He was, in fact, the chief
adviser of the heir-apparent, to whom was entrusted the delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
task of drawing up his state papers; and he would, no doubt, in the
event of a change of ministry, have been raised to one of the most
valuable posts that his party could offer, had not the King's recovery
put an end to his golden expectations.</p>

<p class="indent">Shortly after, a dissolution took place, when he hurried
off to Stafford, with the intention of again trying his luck with that borough.
One of his fellow-passengers chanced to be an elector; on discovering
which, Sheridan took the opportunity of asking him for whom he
should vote. The other, ignorant who it was that put the question,
replied that neither of the candidates were much to be depended on,
but that he would vote for the devil sooner than that scamp Sheridan.
The conversation here dropped for a while; but, having in the interim
contrived to learn from the coachman the name of his opponent,
Sheridan resumed the discourse by observing, that he had heard say
there were many corrupt rogues among the Stafford electors, and that
among them was one Thompson, the biggest scoundrel in the borough.
"I am Mr. Thompson," exclaimed his fellow-traveller, crimson
with rage. "And I am Mr. Sheridan," rejoined the other. The
joke was immediately seen, and the parties became sworn friends
ever after. Another anecdote, equally characteristic of Sheridan, is
told of him at this period. A few days after his return to town,
having hired a hackney-coach to take him from Carlton Palace to his
own house, he found himself, as usual, without the means of paying
for it. Luckily he espied his friend Richardson in the street, and,
calling to him to get in, he engaged him in a favourite discussion,
which he was well aware would draw forth all his energies; and then,
after adroitly contradicting him, and so rousing his utmost indignation,
he affected to grow angry himself; and, exclaiming that he
would not remain an instant longer in the same coach with a man
capable of holding such language, he insisted on Jehu setting him
down, and walked quietly to his own house, which was now but a
few yards off, leaving his angry friend to pay the fare!</p>

<p class="indent">In the year 1792, Sheridan lost his beautiful and accomplished
wife; a loss which he took greatly to heart. It was indeed an irreparable
one; for she had long been his best "guide and friend;" and
her benign influence removed, he plunged headlong into that reckless
extravagance which ultimately sealed his ruin. Henceforth, for some
time, he seldom or never distinguished himself in Parliament, though
the French Revolution was then setting all England in a ferment; but
was chiefly to be heard of in the circles of fashion, and at the Carlton
House revels. On the occasion, however, of the Nore Mutiny, he
took a decided part, nobly sacrificing all party considerations in his
zeal to maintain his country's honour.</p>

<p class="indent">About four years after the death of his first wife, Sheridan
entered into a second marriage with Miss Ogle, daughter of the Dean of
Winchester. His affairs were now in a sad state of embarrassment,
for he obtained but a slender jointure with his wife; and, to retrieve
them, he once again turned his attention to the stage. In
1799 he brought out the play of "Pizarro," which had a prodigious
run, and is still occasionally performed. The style and sentiments of
this drama are in the worst possible taste, utterly at variance with
nature, and outraging all the legitimate rules of composition. Strange,
however, to say its author was as proud of it as even of his "School for Scandal."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">On the death of Mr. Pitt, and the accession of the Whigs to
power, Sheridan was appointed Treasurer of the Navy,&mdash;a situation which he
held but a short time, the ministry being unexpectedly broken up by
the demise of Mr. Fox. It was while holding this office that he gave
a splendid entertainment to the Prince of Wales, which swallowed up
his whole year's income. Nevertheless he turned even this absurd
extravagance to account; for, having occasion to allude to his
resignation in Parliament, he, with matchless effrontery, thanked
God that he quitted office as poor as when he entered upon it!</p>

<p class="indent">Parliament being dissolved soon after Fox's death, Sheridan,
after a violent struggle, was returned for Westminster, but was unseated
on the next dissolution, which occurred in 1807. Somewhere about
this time his friend the Prince made him a privy-councillor, and
appointed him to the Receivership of the Duchy of Cornwall; but,
whatever were the pecuniary advantages he derived from this sinecure,
they were more than counterbalanced by the destruction of all
his theatrical property by fire. This calamity took place in 1809,
when Sheridan was on his legs at St. Stephen's. He instantly quitted
the House, and, after coolly looking on at the conflagration, retired
to a neighbouring tavern, where he was found by a friend, luxuriating
over a bottle of wine. On being asked how he could think of enjoying
himself at such a time, he replied, "A man may surely be allowed
to take a glass by his own fireside!"</p>

<p class="indent">We now approach the last and most melancholy period
of poor Sheridan's life. The sun that we have seen blazing so long and
brilliantly, is now about to set in storm and cloud. Having committed
himself with his party by some mysterious intrigues in which he had
engaged, relative to the formation of a new ministry, Sheridan lost
almost all his political influence; and, on the dissolution of Parliament
in 1812, was defeated in his attempts to be re-elected for Stafford.
Ruin now begun to stare him in the face. The management
of the new theatre had been, some time before, taken out of his
hands; his debts were on the increase; his duns grew daily more
clamorous; and he had no longer the House of Commons to fly to for
shelter. To such a wretched state of destitution was he now reduced,
that he was absolutely compelled to pawn his books, his pictures,
and all his most valuable furniture. Nor was this the worst.
In the spring of 1814 he was arrested and carried to a spunging-house,
where he remained in "durance vile" upwards of three days!</p>

<p class="indent">From this moment he never again held up his head,
or ventured abroad into the world. His heart was broken, and he would
sit for hours weeping in the solitude of his chamber. Yet, though
hovering on the very threshold of the grave, his duns allowed him
not the slightest respite; writs and executions were multiplied
against him; and the bailiffs at length forced their way into his house.
He was then dying; yet, even in that state, the agents of the law
were about to carry him out in blankets, when the interference of a
friend saved him from the humiliation of drawing his last breath in a
spunging-house. And where were all his fashionable and titled
friends during this season of distress? Where were the princes, and
dukes, and lords, of whom he had so long been the idol? All had
flown; the sight of his death-bed&mdash;and such a death-bed!&mdash;would, no
doubt, have been too much for their delicate sensibilities; and, with
the exception of Messrs. Moore, Rogers, and one or two other friends,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
who remained faithful to the last, there was not one to close his dying
eyes. But when all was over, then came the pomp and the pageantry,
the titled pall-bearers, the long array of mourners, the
public funeral, and the tomb in Westminster Abbey! Poor Sheridan!
He was thought of sufficient consequence to be laid by the
side of the departed worthies of England; yet the very men who
paid this homage to his ashes, scorned to come near him in his poverty!</p>

<p class="indent">At the period of his death, which took place in 1816, Sheridan
had just completed his sixty-fifth year. His constitution was robust and
healthy; and he might have lived full ten years longer, had not grief
and his own excesses cut short the span of his days. In youth he
was considered handsome; but long confirmed habits of conviviality
had obliterated, ere he had yet entered on the autumn of life,
every trace of comeliness. His manners were remarkably insinuating,
especially to women; his wit ever at command; and his flow of
animal spirits unflagging. His worst failing was his unconquerable
indolence. To this may be attributed all his misfortunes, and those
humiliating expedients to which he was compelled to have recourse
in order in ward off the evil day. So deeply was this vice implanted
in his nature, that, even when he had to attend the funeral of his old
friend Richardson, he could not be prevailed on to set out in time,
but arrived after the service was concluded, which, at his particular
request, was performed a second time.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Lord Byron, who saw much of him in his decline,
has stated&mdash;as we see by Moore's admirable life of that poet&mdash;that
Sheridan's wit was bitter and morose, rather than sparkling or conciliatory.
It should be borne in mind, however, that he was then worn down by
sickness, disappointed in all his hopes, and deserted by that Prince
on whose favour he laid so much stress, and to preserve which he
had made so many sacrifices. The concurrent testimony of those
who knew him in his best days represents him as having been, like a
Wharton or a Villiers, the "life of pleasure and the soul of whim."
That in the course of his meteor-like career he committed many
indefensible acts, and carried the faculty of non-payment to its highest
point of perfection, is true; but, before we finally condemn him, let
us consider what was his education, what his original position in
society, and, above all, what were his temptations. He was never
taught in early life to set a right value on thrifty and industrious
habits. His father was an eccentric being from whose example he
could derive no benefit; and, at an age when the majority of men are
yet in the parental leading-strings, he was cast adrift upon the world,
to sink or swim as might happen. Thus situated, without any legitimate
profession or certain income, he made his own way to celebrity;
and if, while associating with people infinitely his superiors in
rank, wealth, and all worldly advantages, he imbibed their extravagances
and aped their follies, such weakness is surely a fitter subject
for our regret than indignation. At any rate, let us not forget that, if
he erred, he paid the penalty; and that many men a thousand times
worse than ever he was, but with more tact in concealing their faults,
have gone down to the grave honoured and lamented as good citizens
and good Christians.

<hr class="r5" />
<h3>CHAPTER THE SEVENTH</h3>
<p class="f110">OLIVER CONTINUES THE REFRACTORY.</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest
pace, and paused not once for breath until he reached the workhouse-gate.
Having rested here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of
sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked
loudly at the wicket, and presented such a rueful face to the
aged pauper who opened it, that even he, who saw nothing but
rueful faces about him at the best of times, started back in astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, what's the matter with the boy?" said the old pauper.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Bumble! Mr. Bumble!" cried Noah, with well-affected
dismay, and in tones so loud and agitated that they not only
caught the ear of Mr. Bumble himself who happened to be hard
by, but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without
his cocked hat,&mdash;which is a very curious and remarkable
circumstance, as showing that even a beadle, acted upon by a
sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a momentary
visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of
personal dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!" said Noah; "Oliver,
sir,&mdash;Oliver has&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"What? what?" interposed Mr. Bumble, with a gleam of pleasure
in his metallic eyes. "Not run away: he hasn't run away; has he, Noah?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, sir, no; not run away, sir, but he's turned
wicious," replied Noah. "He tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried
to murder Charlotte, and then missis. Oh, what dreadful pain
it is! such agony, please sir!" and here Noah writhed and
twisted his body into an extensive variety of eel-like positions;
thereby giving Mr. Bumble to understand that, from the violent
and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist, he had sustained severe
internal injury and damage, from which he was at that speaking
suffering the acutest torture.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">When Noah saw that the intelligence he
communicated perfectly paralysed Mr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect
thereunto, by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder
than before: and, when he observed a gentleman in a white
waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in his lamentations
than ever, rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract
the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman aforesaid.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent space-above1">The gentleman's notice was very soon attracted;
for he had not walked three paces when he turned angrily round, and inquired
what that young cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour
him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations
so designated, an involuntary process.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's a poor boy from the free-school, sir," replied Mr. Bumble,
"who has been nearly murdered&mdash;all but murdered, sir&mdash;by young Twist."</p>

<p class="indent">"By Jove!" exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat,
stopping short. "I knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first,
that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!"</p>

<p class="indent">"He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,"
said Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.</p>

<p class="indent">"And his missis," interposed Mr. Claypole.</p>

<p class="indent">"And his master, too, I think you said, Noah?"
added Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, he's out, or he would have murdered him," replied Noah.
"He said he wanted to&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! said he wanted to&mdash;did he, my boy?" inquired the
gentleman in the white waistcoat.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir," replied Noah; "and, please sir, missis
wants to know whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there
directly, and flog him, 'cause master's out."</p>

<p class="indent">"Certainly, my boy; certainly," said the gentleman
in the white waistcoat, smiling benignly, and patting Noah's head,
which was about three inches higher than his own. "You're
a good boy&mdash;a very good boy. Here's a penny for you.
Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry's with your cane, and see
what's best to be done. Don't spare him, Bumble."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, I will not, sir," replied the beadle, adjusting
the wax-end which was twisted round the bottom of his cane for purposes
of parochial flagellation.</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell Sowerberry not to spare him, either. They'll never
do anything with him, without stripes and bruises," said the gentleman
in the white waistcoat.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll take care, sir," replied the beadle. And, the
cocked hat and cane having been by this time adjusted to their owner's
satisfaction, Mr. Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves
with all speed to the undertaker's shop.</p>

<p class="indent">Here the position of affairs had not at all improved,
for Sowerberry had not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick
with undiminished vigour at the cellar-door. The accounts of
his ferocity, as related by Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were
of so startling a nature that Mr. Bumble judged it prudent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
parley before opening the door: with this view, he gave a kick
at the outside, by way of prelude, and then, applying his mouth
to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone,</p>

<p class="indent">"Oliver!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Come; you let me out!" replied Oliver, from the inside.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you know this here voice, Oliver?" said Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes," replied Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ain't you afraid of it, sir? Ain't you a-trembling while I
speak, sir?" said Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p class="indent">"No!" replied Oliver, boldly.</p>

<p class="indent">An answer so different from the one he had expected
to elicit, and was in the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a
little. He stepped back from the keyhole, drew himself up to
his full height, and looked from one to another of the three bystanders
in mute astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad," said Mrs.
Sowerberry. "No boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you."</p>

<p class="indent">"It's not madness, ma'am," replied Mr. Bumble, after a few
moments of deep meditation; "it's meat."</p>

<p class="indent">"What!" exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.</p>

<p class="indent">"Meat, ma'am, meat," replied Bumble, with stern
emphasis. "You've overfed him, ma'am. You've raised a artificial soul
and spirit in him, ma'am, unbecoming a person of his condition,
as the board, Mrs. Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers,
will tell you. What have paupers to do with soul or spirit
either? It's quite enough that we let 'em have live bodies.
If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma'am, this would never have
happened."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear, dear!" ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising
her eyes to the kitchen ceiling. "This comes of being liberal!"</p>

<p class="indent">The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver had
consisted in a profuse bestowal upon him, of all the dirty odds and
ends which nobody else would eat; so that there was a great deal of
meekness and self-devotion in her voluntarily remaining under
Mr. Bumble's heavy accusation, of which, to do her justice, she
was wholly innocent in thought, word, or deed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah!" said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought
her eyes down to earth again. "The only thing that can be done now,
that I know of, is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so
till he's a little starved down, and then to take him out, and
keep him on gruel all through his apprenticeship. He comes of
a bad family&mdash;excitable natures, Mrs. Sowerberry. Both the
nurse and doctor said that that mother of his made her way
here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed any
well-disposed woman weeks before."</p>

<p class="indent">At this point of Mr. Bumble's discourse, Oliver just
hearing enough to know that some further allusion was being made to
his mother, recommenced kicking with a violence which rendered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
every other sound inaudible. Sowerberry returned at this
juncture, and Oliver's offence having been explained to him,
with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated
to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar-door in a twinkling, and
dragged his rebellious apprentice out by the collar.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver's clothes had been torn in the beating he had received;
his face was bruised and scratched, and his hair scattered over his
forehead. The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and
when he was pulled out of his prison, he scowled boldly on
Noah, and looked quite undismayed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain't you?" said Sowerberry,
giving Oliver a shake, and a sound box on the ear.</p>

<p class="indent">"He called my mother names," replied Oliver, sullenly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?"
said Mrs. Sowerberry. "She deserved what he said, and worse."</p>

<p class="indent">"She didn't!" said Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">"She did!" said Mrs. Sowerberry.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's a lie!" said Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p class="indent">This flood of tears left Sowerberry no alternative. If
he had hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must
be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been,
according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established,
a brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation
of a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous
for recital within the limits of this chapter. To do him
justice, he was, as far as his power went,&mdash;it was not very
extensive,&mdash;kindly disposed towards the boy; perhaps because it was
his interest to be so, perhaps because his wife disliked him.
The flood of tears, however, left him no resource; so he at once
gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs. Sowerberry
herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble's subsequent application of
the parochial cane rather unnecessary. For the rest of the day
he was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump
and a slice of bread; and, at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after
making various remarks outside the door, by no means complimentary
to the memory of his mother, looked into the room,
and, amidst the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte,
ordered him up stairs to his dismal bed.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not until he was left alone in the silence and
stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave
way to the feelings which the day's treatment may be supposed
likely to have awakened in a mere child. He had listened to
their taunts with a look of dogged contempt; he had borne the
lash without a cry, for he felt that pride swelling in his heart
which would have kept down a shriek to the last, if they had
roasted him alive. But, now that there were none to see or
hear him, he fell upon his knees on the floor, and, hiding his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
face in his hands, wept such tears as God send for the credit of
our nature, few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him.</p>

<p class="indent">For a long time Oliver remained motionless in this
attitude. The candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his
feet, and having gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently,
gently undid the fastenings of the door and looked abroad.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a cold dark night. The stars seemed to the
boy's eyes further from the earth than he had ever seen them before;
there was no wind, and the sombre shadows thrown by the
trees on the earth looked sepulchral and death-like, from being
so still. He softly reclosed the door, and, having availed himself
of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief
the few articles of wearing apparel he had, sat himself
down upon a bench to wait for morning.</p>

<p class="indent">With the first ray of light that struggled through the
crevices in the shutters Oliver rose, and again unbarred the door. One
timid look around,&mdash;one moment's pause of hesitation,&mdash;he had
closed it behind him, and was in the open street.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked to the right and to the left, uncertain
whither to fly. He remembered to have seen the waggons as they went
out, toiling up the hill; he took the same route, and arriving
at a footpath across the fields, which he thought after some distance
led out again into the road, struck into it, and walked quickly on.</p>

<p class="indent">Along this same footpath, Oliver well remembered
he had trotted beside Mr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the
workhouse from the farm. His way lay directly in front of the
cottage. His heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of
this, and he half resolved to turn back. He had come a long
way though, and should lose a great deal of time by doing so.
Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of his
being seen; so he walked on.</p>

<p class="indent">He reached the house. There was no appearance of
its inmates stirring at that early hour. Oliver stopped, and peeped
into the garden. A child was weeding one of the little beds;
and, as he stopped, he raised his pale face, and disclosed the
features of one of his former companions. Oliver felt glad to
see him before he went, for, though younger than himself, he
had been his little friend and playmate; they had been beaten,
and starved, and shut up together, many and many a time.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush, Dick!" said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and
thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him. "Is any one up?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nobody but me," replied the child.</p>

<p class="indent">"You mustn't say you saw me, Dick," said Oliver;
"I am running away. They beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am
going to seek my fortune some long way off, I don't know where.
How pale you are!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"I heard the doctor tell them I was dying," replied
the child with a faint smile. "I am very glad to see you, dear; but
don't stop, don't stop."</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b'ye to you,"
replied Oliver. "I shall see you again, Dick; I know I shall.
You will be well and happy."</p>

<p class="indent">"I hope so," replied the child, "after I am dead,
but not before. I know the doctor must be right. Oliver; because I
dream so much of heaven, and angels, and kind faces that I
never see when I am awake. Kiss me," said the child, climbing
up the low gate, and flinging his little arms round Oliver's neck.
"Good-b'ye dear! God bless you!"</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The blessing was from a young child's lips,
but it was the first that Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and
through all the struggles and sufferings of his after life, through
all the troubles and changes of many weary years, he never once forgot it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THE EIGHTH</h3>
<p class="f110">OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON, AND ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD<br /> A STRANGE SORT OF YOUNG GENTLEMAN.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated,
and once more gained the high-road. It was eight o'clock now;
and, though he was nearly five miles away from the town, he
ran, and hid behind the hedges by turns, till noon, fearing that
he might be pursued and overtaken. Then he sat down to rest
at the side of a mile-stone, and began to think for the first time
where he had better go and try to live.</p>

<p class="indent">The stone by which he was seated bore, in large characters,
an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to
London. The name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy's
mind. London!&mdash;that great large place!&mdash;nobody&mdash;not even
Mr. Bumble&mdash;could ever find him there. He had often heard
the old men in the workhouse, too, say that no lad of spirit need
want in London, and that there were ways of living in that vast
city which those who had been bred up in country parts had no
idea of. It was the very place for a homeless boy, who must
die in the streets unless some one helped him. As these things
passed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and
again walked forward.</p>

<p class="indent">He had diminished the distance between himself and
London by full four miles more, before he recollected how much he
must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination.
As this consideration forced itself upon him, he slackened
his pace a little, and meditated upon his means of getting
there. He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs
of stockings in his bundle; and a penny&mdash;a gift of Sowerberry's
after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
ordinarily well&mdash;in his pocket. "A clean shirt," thought Oliver,
"is a very comfortable thing,&mdash;very; and so are two pairs of
darned stockings, and so is a penny; but they are small helps to
a sixty-five miles' walk in winter time." But Oliver's thoughts,
like those of most other people, although they were extremely
ready and active to point out his difficulties, were wholly at a
loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them; so,
after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose, he
changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and trudged on.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time
tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water
which he begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side. When
the night came, he turned into a meadow, and, creeping close
under a hay-rick, determined to lie there till morning. He
felt frightened at first, for the wind moaned dismally over the
empty fields, and he was cold and hungry, and more alone than
he had ever felt before. Being very tired with his walk, however,
he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.</p>

<p class="indent">He felt cold and stiff when he got up next morning,
and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small
loaf in the very first village through which he passed. He had
walked no more than twelve miles, when night closed in again;
for his feet were sore, and his legs so weak that they trembled
beneath him. Another night passed in the bleak damp air
only made him worse; and, when he set forward on his journey
next morning, he could hardly crawl along.</p>

<p class="indent">He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a
stage-coach came up, and then begged of the outside passengers; but
there were very few who took any notice of him, and even those, told
him to wait till they got to the top of the hill, and then let
them see how far he could run for a halfpenny. Poor Oliver
tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but was unable to do
it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet. When the outsides saw
this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring
that he was an idle young dog, and didn't deserve anything;
and the coach rattled away, and left only a cloud of dust behind.</p>

<p class="indent">In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up,
warning all persons who begged within the district that they would be
sent to jail, which frightened Oliver very much, and made him
very glad to get out of them with all possible expedition. In
others he would stand about the inn-yards, and look mournfully
at every one who passed; a proceeding which generally
terminated in the landlady's ordering one of the post-boys who
were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of the place,
for she was sure he had come to steal something. If he begged
at a farmer's house, ten to one but they threatened to set the
dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
talked about the beadle, which brought Oliver's heart up into
his mouth,&mdash;very often the only thing he had there, for many
hours together.</p>

<p class="indent">In fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted
turnpike-man, and a benevolent old lady, Oliver's troubles would have
been shortened by the very same process which put an end to his
mother's; in other words, he would most assuredly have fallen
dead upon the king's highway. But the turnpike-man gave
him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady, who had a
shipwrecked grandson wandering barefooted in some distant
part of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave
him what little she could afford&mdash;and more&mdash;with such kind
and gentle words, and such tears of sympathy and compassion,
that they sank deeper into Oliver's soul than all the sufferings
he had ever undergone.</p>

<p class="indent">Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native
place, Oliver limped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The window-shutters
were closed, the street was empty, not a soul had
awakened to the business of the day. The sun was rising in all
his splendid beauty, but the light only seemed to show the boy
his own lonesomeness and desolation as he sat with bleeding feet
and covered with dust upon a cold door-step.</p>

<p class="indent">By degrees the shutters were opened, the window-blinds
were drawn up, and people began passing to and fro. Some few
stopped to gaze at Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round
to stare at him as they hurried by; but none relieved him, or
troubled themselves to inquire how he came there. He had no
heart to beg, and there he sat.</p>

<p class="indent">He had been crouching on the step for some time, gazing
listlessly at the coaches as they passed through, and thinking how
strange it seemed that they could do with ease in a few hours
what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination
beyond his years to accomplish, when he was roused by observing
that a boy who had passed him carelessly some minutes before, had
returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from the
opposite side of the way. He took little heed of this at first;
but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation
so long, that Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look.
Upon this, the boy crossed over, and, walking close up to Oliver, said,</p>

<p class="indent">"Hullo! my covey, what's the row?"</p>

<p class="indent">The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young
wayfarer was about his own age, but one of the queerest-looking boys
that Oliver had ever seen. He was a snub-nosed, flat-browed,
common-faced boy enough, and as dirty a juvenile as one would
wish to see; but he had got about him all the airs and manners
of a man. He was short of his age, with rather bow-legs, and
little sharp ugly eyes. His hat was stuck on the top of his
head so slightly that it threatened to fall off every moment, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
would have done so very often if the wearer had not had a
knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch,
which brought it back to its old place again. He wore a man's
coat, which reached nearly to his heels. He had turned the
cuffs back halfway up his arm to get his hands out of the
sleeves, apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them
into the pockets of his corduroy trousers, for there he kept
them. He was altogether as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman
as ever stood three feet six, or something less, in his bluchers.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hullo, my covey, what's the row?" said this
strange young gentleman to Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am very hungry and tired," replied Oliver, the tears
standing in his eyes as he spoke. "I have walked a long way,&mdash;I
have been walking these seven days."</p>

<p class="indent">"Walking for sivin days!" said the young gentleman.
"Oh, I see. Beak's order, eh? But," he added, noticing Oliver's
look of surprise, "I suppose you don't know wot a beak is, my
flash com-pan-i-on."</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver mildly replied, that he had always heard
a bird's mouth described by the term in question.</p>

<p class="indent">"My eyes, how green!" exclaimed the young gentleman.
"Why, a beak's a madg'st'rate; and when you walk by a beak's
order, it's not straight forerd, but always going up, and nivir
coming down agen. Was you never on the mill?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What mill?" inquired Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">"What mill!&mdash;why, <i>the</i> mill,&mdash;the mill as
takes up so little room that it'll work inside a stone jug, and always goes
better when the wind's low with people than when it's high, acos then
they can't get workmen. But come," said the young gentleman;
"you want grub, and you shall have it. I'm at low-water-mark,&mdash;only
one bob and a magpie; but, <i>as</i> far <i>as</i> it goes, I'll
fork out and stump. Up with you on your pins. There:
now then, morrice."</p>

<p class="indent">Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took
him to an adjacent chandler's shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of
ready-dressed ham and a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself
expressed it, "a fourpenny bran;" the ham being kept clean and
preserved from dust by the ingenious expedient of making a
hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb, and stuffing
it therein. Taking the bread under his arm, the young gentleman
turned into a small public-house, and led the way to a tap-room
in the rear of the premises. Here, a pot of beer was
brought in by the direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver,
falling to, at his new friend's bidding, made a long and hearty
meal, during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him
from time to time with great attention.</p>

<p class="indent">"Going to London?" said the strange boy, when
Oliver had at length concluded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Got any lodgings?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"Money?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No."</p>

<p class="indent">The strange boy whistled, and put his arms into his pockets
as far as the big-coat sleeves would let them go.</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you live in London?" inquired Oliver.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I do, when I'm at home," replied the boy. "I suppose
you want some place to sleep in to-night, don't you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I do indeed," answered Oliver. "I have not slept under a
roof since I left the country."</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't fret your eyelids on that score," said the
young gentleman. "I've got to be in London to-night, and I know a
'spectable old genelman as lives there, wot'll give you lodgings
for nothink, and never ask for the change; that is, if any genelman
he knows interduces you. And don't he know me?&mdash;Oh,
no,&mdash;not in the least,&mdash;by no means,&mdash;certainly not."</p>

<p class="indent">The young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the
latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical, and finished the
beer as he did so.</p>

<p class="indent">This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to
be resisted, especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance
that the old gentleman already referred to, would doubtless
provide Oliver with a comfortable place without loss of
time. This led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue,
from which Oliver discovered that his friend's name was Jack
Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and <i>protegé</i> of the
elderly gentleman before mentioned.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Dawkins's appearance did not say a vast deal in
favour of the comforts which his patron's interest obtained for those
whom he took under his protection; but as he had a somewhat
flighty and dissolute mode of conversing, and furthermore
avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by
the <i>sobriquet</i> of "The artful Dodger," Oliver concluded that,
being of a dissipated and careless turn, the moral precepts of
his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him. Under
this impression, he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion
of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he
found the Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he
should, to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance.</p>

<p class="indent">As John Dawkins objected to their entering London
before nightfall, it was nearly eleven o'clock when they reached the
turnpike at Islington. They crossed from the Angel into St.
John's-road, struck down the small street which terminates at
Sadler's Wells theatre, through Exmouth-street and Coppice-row,
down the little court by the side of the workhouse, across
the classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley-in-the-hole,
thence into Little Saffron-hill, and so into Saffron-hill the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
Great, along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace, directing
Oliver to follow close at his heels.</p>

<p class="indent">Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in
keeping sight of his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty
glances on either side of the way as he passed along. A dirtier
or more wretched place he had never seen. The street was very
narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy
odours. There were a good many small shops; but the only
stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at
that time of night, were crawling in and out at the doors, or
screaming from the inside. The sole places that seemed to
prosper amid the general blight of the place were the public-houses,
and in them, the lowest orders of Irish (who are generally
the lowest orders of anything) were wrangling with might and
main. Covered ways and yards, which here and there diverged
from the main street, disclosed little knots of houses where
drunken men and women were positively wallowing in the filth;
and from several of the doorways, great ill-looking fellows were
cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, upon no very
well-disposed or harmless errands.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver was just considering whether he hadn't better
run away, when they reached the bottom of the hill: his conductor,
catching him by the arm, pushed open the door of a house near
Field-lane, and, drawing him into the passage, closed it behind them.</p>

<p class="indent">"Now, then," cried a voice from below, in reply
to a whistle from the Dodger.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Plummy and slam!</i>" was the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">This seemed to be some watchword or signal that it
was all right; for the light of a feeble candle gleamed upon the wall
at the farther end of the passage, and a man's face peeped out
from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away.</p>

<p class="indent">"There's two on you," said the man, thrusting the candle
farther out, and shading his eyes with his hand. "Who's the t'other one?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A new pal," replied Jack, pulling Oliver forward.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where did he come from?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Greenland. Is Fagin up stairs?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, he's a sortin' the wipes. Up with you!" The candle
was drawn back, and the face disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">Oliver, groping his way with one hand, and with the
other firmly grasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty
the dark and broken stairs which his conductor mounted with an
ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with
them. He threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him.</p>

<p class="indent">The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly
black with age and dirt. There was a deal-table before the fire, upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
which was a candle stuck in a ginger-beer bottle; two or three
pewter pots, a loaf and butter, and a plate. In a frying-pan
which was on the fire, and which was secured to the mantelshelf
by a string, some sausages were cooking; and standing
over them, with a toasting-fork in his hand, was a very old
shrivelled Jew, whose villanous-looking and repulsive face was
obscured by a quantity of matted red hair. He was dressed in
a greasy flannel gown, with his throat bare, and seemed to be
dividing his attention between the frying-pan and a clothes-horse,
over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were
hanging. Several rough beds made of old sacks were huddled
side by side on the floor; and seated round the table were four
or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking long clay
pipes and drinking spirits with all the air of middle-aged men.
These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few
words to the Jew, and then turned round and grinned at Oliver,
as did the Jew himself, toasting-fork in hand.</p>

<p class="indent">"This is him, Fagin," said Jack Dawkins;
"my friend, Oliver Twist."</p>

<p class="indent">The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to
Oliver, took him by the hand, and hoped he should have the honour
of his intimate acquaintance. Upon this, the young gentlemen
with the pipes came round him, and shook both his hands very
hard,&mdash;especially the one in which he held his little bundle.
One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him;
and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets,
in order that, as he was very tired, he might not have the trouble
of emptying them when he went to bed. These civilities
would probably have been extended much further, but for a
liberal exercise of the Jew's toasting-fork on the heads and
shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them.</p>

<p class="indent">"We are very glad to see you, Oliver,&mdash;very," said
the Jew. "Dodger, take off the sausages, and draw a tub near the fire for
Oliver. Ah, you're a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh,
my dear? There are a good many of 'em, ain't there? We've
just looked 'em out ready for the wash; that's all, Oliver;
that's all. Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p class="indent">The latter part of this speech was hailed by a boisterous
shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman,
in the midst of which they went to supper.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Oliver ate his share; and the Jew then mixed him
a glass of hot gin and water, telling him he must drink it off directly, because
another gentleman wanted the tumbler. Oliver did as he
was desired. Almost instantly afterwards, he felt himself gently
lifted on to one of the sacks, and then he sunk into a deep sleep.

<h2>THE PORTRAIT GALLERY.&mdash;No. II.</h2>

<p class="indent">Dr. Cleaver, whose portrait we next reviewed, displayed a physiognomy
widely different from that of <span class="smcap">Dr. Dulcet</span>. It did not exhibit
any of the milk of human kindness; or, if ever such a benign
fluid had circulated in his veins, it had been curded by the rennet of
early disappointment in every young hope. The features were stern
and inflexible,&mdash;cast-iron, moulded by philosophy; a Cynic smile
portrayed contempt of the world, or rather of society, such as it then
was, is, and most probably ever will be. Yet his rubicond cheeks
and vinous nose proclaimed that he was fond of the good things of
this perishable globe; and few men, when he had acquired wealth, enjoyed
life and its luxuries with greater zest than he did. His maxim
was founded on what he would call <i>the whole duty of man</i>; which
was, <i>to keep what we get, and to get all we can</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Edward Cleaver was born in that class of human beings denominated
<i>paupers</i>. He was ushered into life a burthen on the parish in
which he had been found, at the door of a butcher of the name of
Cleaver, (whose patronymic was generously bestowed on him,) in a
condition as natural as his birth. Cleaver was a man of a <i>serious</i>
way of thinking; and, fearing that the adoption of an orphan infant might
asperse his sanctimonious character, and thereby injure his trade,
very properly sent the child to the parish officers. These worthies
would willingly have made him paternise the thing; but he had evidence
of its having been found abandoned in the street.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether a burthen be carried by a body corporate or an
individual, it is nevertheless an obnoxious incumbrance, of which the bearer
is anxious to rid himself as soon as he possibly can; and therefore,
maugre the puling and mawkish cant of some would-be philanthropic
scribblers, a parish has just the same right to grumble at a burthen,
and cast it off as feasibly as may be, as a hod-bearer to relieve
himself of his load, a donkey of his panniers, or a nursery-maid of a
squalling and ponderous brat. Therefore, overseers are perfectly
justifiable in having recourse to all the industrious methods that sound
political economy can suggest to shake off the taxation imposed upon
their parishioners by improvidence and vice. However, all their ingenuity
could not prevent the growth of Ned Cleaver, who attained
the age of seven, illustrating the fact, that vital air can support the
functions of life with the aid of but little sustenance: and the imp was
so hale and hearty, that they thought him "ragged and tough"
enough for anything, and sent him to sea.</p>

<p class="indent">To relate his mishaps as a cabin-boy on board a collier
would fill a volume; suffice it to say, the lad was naturally stubborn, and
would not be persuaded that he was created to work without sufficient
food, and get thrashed in lieu of wages; and finding, to use
the old joke, that, although he was <i>bred</i> to the sea, the sea was not
<i>bread</i> to him, he decamped at Plymouth, and joined a company of
strolling tumblers, hurdy-gurdy players, and mountebanks, that were
travelling about the country.</p>

<p class="indent">Ned had now attained is sixteenth year, and had perfected himself;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
in forecastle and caboose, in various accomplishments; he could
sing a slang-song, chop his jaws in various modulations, was a very
<i>Moscheles</i> on the salt-box, danced a hornpipe, mimicked all sorts of
infirmities, and could make the most horrible faces, that would so
disfigure him that no one could recognise his natural features, which
were uncommonly handsome; so much so indeed, that he became
a great favourite of the ladies of the company: but, although he
<i>ruled the roost</i> with the fair sex, he was scurvily <i>basted</i> upon
every trivial occasion by the gentlemen performers, and was therefore not
much better off on land, than when at sea he was flogged up aloft to
reef, or flogged down to the salutary exercise of the <i>holy stone</i>,
which would teach the most impious chap to pray. Cleaver, therefore,
betook himself to his <i>lower extremities</i> in the neighbourhood of
London; and, once more a <i>filius populi</i>, threw himself in the tide
of our population in search of work and food. For several days he
strayed about this wealthy metropolis, and was well-nigh proving the
veracity of those sapient legislators, who maintain that such vagabonds
have <i>no business to live</i>,&mdash;which is indeed a truism. Happily
for our young vagrant, he one night fell in with a drunken old man
who was endeavouring to chalk upon the walls, in gigantic letters,
the name of a celebrated physician. It immediately occurred to
Master Ned that, if he could afford assistance to the staggering artist,
he, in return, might afford him some relief. It was a providential
inspiration. Ned helped his new-made acquaintance to what he politely
termed his <i>boozing ken</i>,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
where he was feasted with a <i>blow-out</i> of what
his patron called <i>grub and bub</i> (<i>Anglicè</i>, victuals and drink); and,
after enjoying a delicious night's rest in an Irish <i>dry lodging</i> upon
wet straw, he was admitted as an assistant in the chalking line, at
sixpence per diem. His master, who when sober could not read,
would oftentimes make sad mistakes when he was, in every sense of
the denomination, a "<i>knight of the brush and moon</i>,"&mdash;which, in the
language of the holy land, meaneth "<i>in the wind</i>,"&mdash;and our apprentice
soon became an indispensable assistant, since his master could earn
six shillings a day, and get as drunk as a lord, by paying him sixpence
out of his salary. Now, although our youth was not ungrateful,
yet he was ambitious, and he could not see the reason why
such a disproportion in the wages of labour should exist; he one
morning took it into his head to work on his own bottom, and therefore
presented himself to his chief employer, a Dr. Doall, with the
abominable intention of basely undermining his benefactor at half-price.</p>

<p class="indent">Doall was much pleased with his appearance and his candour,
but still more with his proposal; and Ned was forthwith taken into his
service. His occupation <i>merely</i> consisted in cleaning the whole
house, answering the door, running errands, helping to cook the dinner,
serving at table, pounding medicines, washing dishes, scouring
knives and forks, and blacking shoes, <i>mooning</i> about the streets at
night chalking his master's name, and during his leisure moments
he was advised to study physic, and wash out phials and gallipots;
for which services he was put upon board wages, at the rate of
ninepence per diem. All these duties he fulfilled most cheerfully,
for he had an incentive to his labours. Next to good living&mdash;when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
he could get it&mdash;Cleaver was a warm admirer of the fair sex, even
when hungry; and, when beauty drank to him with her eyes, he
would have pledged her in small-beer as rapturously as in half-and-half.
Doall had a daughter, an only child; she was remarkable for
her beauty, and no less recommendable by her accomplishments. She
was ever engaged in reading novels and plays, could strum upon the
guitar, and all day long, was either singing or spouting: our apprentice
looked upon her as the paragon all loveliness. If he admired
her, he soon perceived that his youth, his innocence, and perhaps
his good figure, had produced a favourable impression upon the
maiden. A conversation with her father confirmed the surmises of
vanity, when he overheard her sweet voice admitting that he was a
<i>monstrous nice</i> young fellow, and impressing upon her father
the propriety of giving him decent clothes, and making him
look like a gentleman.</p>

<p class="indent">This conversation had the "desired effect." Ned was sent
to suit himself in Monmouth-street, cooky allowed him to dip his crust
in the dripping-pan on roasting-days; and, although on board wages,
Emmelina, the doctor's lovely daughter, permitted him a fair run
of his teeth when her father was out. As the cook was often junketing
with her lover, the sexton of the parish, she did not grudge him
these little advantages.</p>

<p class="indent">One morning, just as he had come home from chalking, the
doctor called him, and bidding him be seated, (a most unexpected honour,
which nearly drove the lad out of his senses,) he informed
him that he was highly satisfied with his conduct, would henceforth
allow him four pounds a year wages, and pay him by the job for other
services, which were to commence by his <i>doing fits</i>; so saying, he
gave him a treatise on epilepsy, and bidding him study the symptoms,
he left him, slipping half-a-crown into his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">The enchanted Cleaver was not long in understanding the
doctor's intentions, and sedulously applied himself to acquire the means of
qualifying himself for his novel occupation; although he was rather
staggered when he read the following: "The patient falls down without
any previous notice, his eyes are so distorted that only the whites
of them are to be seen, his fists are clenched, he foams at the mouth,
thrusts out his tongue, and his body and limbs are agitated and
convulsed. After a continuance of this terrific state, the symptoms
gradually abate; but the patient continues looking wildly and vacantly
around him, perfectly unconscious of what has passed."
Cleaver immediately proceeded to make the most awful faces in his
looking-glass, till he actually frightened himself into the belief that
a real fit was coming on. Delighted with his attempt, no sooner had
Doall returned, than Cleaver fell down in the hall, in all the fearful
distortions of an epileptic.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bravo!&mdash;bravo!" exclaimed the
doctor;&mdash;"admirable!&mdash;excellent!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Delicious!&mdash;wonderful!&mdash;he's a very artist.
Oh, what a tragedian he would make!" exclaimed the daughter;
"how charmingly he would die!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">'Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i10">Thou hast no speculation in those eyes!'"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">"I'll be d&mdash;d if he hasn't, though!" replied Doall; "and if this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
chap does not make his way in the world, I'll swallow a peck of my
own <i>anti-omnibus pills</i>. Now mutter away, my boy&mdash;more foam&mdash;more
foam&mdash;that's it!&mdash;now for a kick&mdash;that's your sort!&mdash;clench
your fist&mdash;capital! capital! Now, my fine fellow, get up, and I'll renovate
you with some of my <i>cardiac anti-nervous balm</i>;" and, so saying,
he took out of his closet a small bottle which contained the aforesaid
liquor, which was neither more nor less than a dram for ladies,
who dared not indulge in more vulgar potations, and which I afterwards
found was composed of cherry-bounce, Curaçoa, Cayenne pepper, ginger,
and some other drug of a most stimulating nature, which once
recommended a certain holy man to a certain great personage;&mdash;a
fact which may be now noticed, since both parties are in the
<i>Elysian</i> Fields.</p>

<p class="indent">It was now settled that the following day at four o'clock,
Cleaver was to fall down in a fit in Albemarle-street, at the door of a
fashionable family-hotel, the doctor driving past at the very time. In a
moment he had collected a crowd around him. One exclaimed,
"The fellow's drunk!"&mdash;another bystander maintained it was apoplexy;
a second, epilepsy; and an old woman assured the group that
it was catalepsy. The lad's face was sprinkled with kennel water,
hartshorn charitably applied to his nostrils, and a stick humanely
crammed between his teeth for fear he should bite his tongue. On a
sudden, and to his infinite satisfaction, Doall jumped out of his job-fly,
and, after looking at the patient for a moment, observed that it
was an <i>attack of idiopathic epilepsy, arising from a determination of
the sanguineous system to the encephalon</i>. This learned illustration
proclaimed the man of science, and every one made way for him with
becoming respect. Our esculapius then took out a small phial from his
pocket, and, pouring two or three drops into Ned's foaming mouth, he
added, "These drops are infallible in recovering people from all sorts
of sympathetic, symptomatic, and idiopathic attacks;" when Cleaver
immediately opened his eyes, looked around him with a vacant stare,
to the great amazement of every one present, and in a stuttering
voice asked where he was. The doctor generously told him where he
lived in a loud and audible manner, gave him half-a-crown, and was
about ascending his pill-box, after bidding him call upon him in a
day or two, when a servant in a splendid livery stepped forward from
the hotel, and informed him that Lady Coverley wished to see him.
He was immediately ushered into the presence of a superannuated
countess, just arrived from the country.</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear sir!" she exclaimed, "I am positively the most
fortunate woman in the world, to have thus accidentally met with such a
prodigy. I witnessed your wonderful cure upon that poor creature,
and I must absolutely get you to see my daughter Virgy. All the
physicians in town have attended her, and I do declare I think they
have done her more harm than good. When Lord Coverley arrives with
Lady Virginia, Virgy shall see you immediately; I declare she must."</p>

<p class="indent">Doall bowed obsequiously, tendered his address, and, slipping
half-a-guinea into the footman's hand, drove off, not without having
heard the servant proclaim to all around, "that he was the
cleverest man in <i>Lunnun</i>, and beat out all other doctors by
<i>chalks</i>;" the fellow being little aware at the time that his
vulgar expression was so applicable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The doctor was fortunate. Lady Virginia, a nervous, romantic
fidget, had been reduced by bleeding, starving, and other expedients,
to <i>linger long</i>; and in a short time Doall, having discovered that she
was in love, recommended marriage, with repeated doses of his "<i>cardiac
anti-nervous balm</i>;" his prescription effected a perfect cure.</p>

<p class="indent">Cleaver was now in great favour, and every day proved to
him that the doctor's daughter's partiality was assuming a more affectionate
character. One morning he was pounding some combustible drugs
in a mortar, when Emmelina familiarly entered into conversation with
him. After having asked him various questions about his parentage,&mdash;when
she heard that he was an orphan, she expressed great sympathy. She then
reverted to her favourite topic, the drama; and asked him if he
often went to the play.</p>

<p class="indent">"Only once, miss," he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">"And what was the performance?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Romeo and Juliet."</p>

<p class="indent">"Delightful piece! How did you like the garden scene, Edward?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">'See how she leans her cheek upon that hand!</span>
<span class="i10">O that I were a glove upon that hand,</span>
<span class="i10">That I might touch that cheek!'</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">And tell me, Edward," she continued with great emotion, "did you not weep?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, bitterly!" he sighed; "bitterly!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm sure you did. When he takes the deadly draught, and says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">'Here's to my love! Oh, true apothecary,</span>
<span class="i10">Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.'"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Unfortunately the enraptured girl suited her action to
the words, and imitating Romeo casting from him the fatal phial, she seized a
bottle of some diabolical ingredient, and threw it into the mortar. A
tremendous detonation followed, blowing up the stuff Cleaver was
pounding, singeing all his hair and burning his face.</p>

<p class="indent">Emmelina's terror at this accident was as great as the pain
it had inflicted; and Cleaver was bellowing, and stamping, and kicking, when
fortunately Doall came in. The poor sufferer expected some immediate
relief from his skill, but was amazed to see him draw back with
looks of admiration, and exclaim, "Beautiful, by Jupiter!&mdash;beautiful!&mdash;Oh,
what a thought!&mdash;what a grand idea!&mdash;beautiful!"</p>

<p class="indent">Emmelina entreated him to dress Ned's scalds, which he set
about doing with hesitation, ever and anon stepping back to gaze upon him
with delight; and, having applied some ointment to his face, he thus proceeded:</p>

<p class="indent">"Edward, my boy, I love you, I admire you; your fits have
worked wonders, and I have now to put your skill to another trial. The
accident that has just blown you up, has admirably suited you for my
purpose. I shall&mdash;what do I say?&mdash;<i>we</i> shall make a fortune. I
must send you on an important mission: you must know that the very ingredients
you were pulverising were for the preparation of a remedy
of my invention, which infallibly cures carbuncly noses; when I say
cures, I mean white-washing them, that they may break out again as
extravagantly as they chuse in other hands. Now, the eldest son of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
Lord Doodly has a nose&mdash;that I must have hold of: oh, such a nose!
like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"A will-o'-the-wisp," exclaimed his daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">"A most appropriate simile," rejoined the doctor. "Well,
Edward, see here; his conk is nothing to the one you shall wear:" and, so
saying, he drew forth from a drawer a most horrible snout of wax,
ingeniously fixed upon leather; and, applying it to the youth's face,
he was actually struck with horror when he beheld himself in the
glass. Emmelina shrieked, and her father roared out in raptures,
"Admirable! the scalds on your face will add to the beauty of your countenance."</p>

<p class="indent">It was arranged that, on the following day Cleaver was to
start by the stage for Southampton, where Lord Doodly and his son resided.
He was there to sport his awful nose in churches, theatres,
public walks, until the whole town should call him "the wretch with
the horrible nose!" According to agreement, after a tender farewell
scene with Emmelina, he proceeded on his journey; but as he was
stepping into the coach at the Golden Cross, a lady with a child upon
her lap shrieked out most vehemently, exclaiming, "Coach! guard!
coach! let me out&mdash;let me out! I will not travel if that there
gentleman comes in, with his nose."</p>

<p class="indent">"What! ma'am," replied the coachman: "would you have
the gemman travel without his snorter to accommodate you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! I shall faint; I will faint! Oh! sir,
take that nose away!"</p>

<p class="indent">Cleaver began to wink and blink most awfully.</p>

<p class="indent">"Let me out! let me out! Oh Lord! where could
a man get such a nose!"</p>

<p class="indent">Cleaver pretended to suffer most cruelly, and clapped his
handkerchief to his face in apparent agony.</p>

<p class="indent">"It's not a nose," exclaimed a gaunt East Indian in a corner,
just awaking from a doze: "it's more like the proboscis of a rhinoceros:
it is a disease which we call in Bengal an elephantiasis; and, egad!
I'll get out of the coach also, for it's the most d&mdash;nable infectious
disorder next to leprosy."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, Gracious!" shrieked the lady, rushing out; "my darling
infant has caught it; my Tommy, my jewel, will have an elephant's nose!"</p>

<p class="indent">"It's a shame," exclaimed the nabob. "I'll complain to
the proprietors. One might as well travel with the plague, and go to bed to
the cholera morbus. Let me out, coachy! let me out this instant!"</p>

<p class="indent">Coachy now began to apprehend the consequences of a complaint
from a person of much weight in Southampton, and politely begged of
Cleaver to take an outside seat. The travellers on the top of the
coach were as much terrified as the inside ones; and Cleaver was
forced to sit on the box next to the driver, who sported an enormous
mangel-wurzel smeller of his own, and seemed much amused with the
terrors of his passengers.</p>

<p class="indent">Cleaver's expedition was most prosperous. He terrified
gipsy parties at Netly, shocked the members of the Yacht Club, interrupted
the sketches of tourists, and kept High-street, above and below
bar, in a state of constant consternation, after having been refused
admittance into half of the hotels. The very parish beadles seemed
to have an eye to his nose. In short, the Strasburg burghers had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
not been more terrified with the sneezer of Han Kenbergins's traveller,
than were the good people of Southampton with that of their
visitor. Having thus brought his snout into notoriety, he returned
to town on a day when he had discovered that Lord Doodly's butler
was going up. The conversation naturally fell upon noses, as the
butler declared that he never in all his born days had seen such a
pair of nozzles as Cleaver's and his young master's. Our adventurer
then informed him that there was only <i>one doctor upon earth</i>
who could cure such terrific diseases, and him he was going up to
consult. His fellow traveller of course observed, that if he could
cure <i>his</i> scent-box he could cure anything; and Cleaver promised
him, over a tankard of ale, to let him hear from him if he was so
fortunate as to get rid of his distressing disorder.</p>

<p class="indent">Two months after, a loud ringing announced a stranger at the
gate of Doodly Hall. It was Cleaver, with his natural facial handle, asking for
the butler. Overjoyed at a discovery so acceptable to his master, who,
in return for his services, might be disposed to overlook his spoliations
with more indulgence, Cleaver was introduced by him to the family,
who all recollected his former frightful appearance. Lord Impy, the
heir of the title and estate, was forthwith sent to London to be placed
under Doall's care. Again he had the good fortune to relieve him,
and his fame had spread far and near, ere the nasal conflagration
broke out again with redoubled virulence.</p>

<p class="indent">Cleaver's services were soon requited by the hand of Emmelina,
and a partnership in <i>the board</i>. He gradually acquired a smattering
of medical knowledge; and, being well aware that affable manners
bring on conversation, and conversation tends to draw out ignorance,
he very wisely assumed a haughty, and at times a brutal manner;
making it a rule never to answer a question, and requesting his patients
to hold their tongues when they presumed to trespass on their
ailments. His unmannerly behaviour was called <i>frankness</i>, his silence
<i>erudition</i>, and his insolence <i>independence</i>. He thus became
one of the wealthiest quacks in London. His romantic Emmelina for some
time rendered him most miserable; but, fortunately for him, she one
night set fire to the house while performing "<i>The Devil to pay</i>" in
her private theatricals, and was duly consumed with the premises.
With his usual good luck, they had been insured for three times
their value; and the doctor was enabled to move to a more fashionable
part of the West End, with the additional <i>puff of a fire, a
burnt wife, and a disconsolate husband</i>!</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The librarian proceeded to relate the adventures
of various other medical men; and we then entered an adjoining room, hung round
with portraits of distinguished characters, amongst whom I was particularly
anxious to learn the history of the once popular patriot,
<span class="smcap">Sir Ruby Ratborough</span>.</p>

<h2>THE BLUE WONDER.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></h2>
<hr class="r5" />
<h3>A MARRIAGE ON CREDIT.</h3>

<p class="indent">Doctor Falcon looked one way, and pretty Susan looked
another, as it has been customary for young people to do, from the remotest
antiquity. The doctor was a very pretty fellow, had been to
two universities, had walked the hospitals of Vienna, Milan, and Pavia,
and had learned so much that there was not one of his craft better
able than himself to post his patients to a better world according
to the most legitimate principles of the most modern systems of the
medical art. But science such as this, is not to be acquired for nothing;
it had cost our worthy doctor nearly every penny of his modest
patrimony. "Never mind!" thought he to himself; "when I get
home, I'll marry some rich girl or other, who may take a fancy to become
the doctor's lady; and so both our turns will be served."</p>

<p class="indent">But what are the wisest resolutions against the eloquence
of a pretty face? Susan was as pretty as a lover could wish her; she felt
the best disposition in the world to become a doctor's lady, but then
she had no money.</p>

<p class="indent">"Never mind, my dear Susan!" said the doctor, as he impressed
a kiss on the lips of the weeping maid; "you see, a doctor must marry,
else people have no confidence in him. You will bring me <i>credit</i>, credit
will bring me <i>patients</i>, the patients money, and, if they should fail,
we have good expectations. Your aunt, Miss Sarah Bugle, is forty
odd, not far from fifty, and rich enough for the seventh part of her
fortune to help us out of all our trouble. We may venture something
upon that!"</p>

<p class="indent">Heavens! what will a young girl not venture for her lover!
Susan's mother had nothing to object, nor her father either, for they
were both in heaven; and her guardian was well pleased to see his
ward form a respectable connexion. Her aunt, Sarah, was also well-pleased,
though, in general, she was little friendly to wedding of any
kind: but, as long as Susan remained unmarried, she saw very clearly
that she would every year be obliged to make some pecuniary advances
to the worthy guardian; and Miss Sarah Bugle was rather stingy,
or, as she was herself wont to say, "she had not a penny more
than she wanted."</p>

<p class="indent">Well: Susan became Mrs. Falcon, and the doctor looked
most industriously out of his windows to see the customers pour into his
house, on the strength of his increased claims to credit. They came
very sparingly; but in their stead there appeared every year, a little
merry face that had never been seen in the house before, to augment
the parental joys of Doctor Falcon and his lady. Sometimes the doctor
would pass his finger, cogitatingly, behind his left ear; but what
could that avail him? There was no driving the little Falcons out of
the nest. They could not cut their bread into thinner slices, for the
children must live; but the doctress made her soups thinner. However,
they all seemed to thrive,&mdash;father, mother, and the four little
ones. They sat on wooden benches and straw chairs as comfortably
as they could have done on quilted cushions; they slept soundly on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
hard mattresses, and wore no costly garments, being well contented
if they could keep themselves neatly and respectably clad. And this
was an art in which Susan was a perfect adept; everything in her
house looked so pretty and neat, that you would have sworn the
doctor must have been extremely well off. "How they manage to
do it, I can't think!" Aunt Sarah would often exclaim.
"It's a blue wonder to me!"</p>

<p class="indent">Not that it was always sunshine: there were days when
the exchequer was quite exhausted; and sometimes whole weeks would elapse
without a single dollar finding its way into the house. But then it
was always some consolation to know that Aunt Sarah was rich, and
sickly, and growing old; and, the worse matters looked at home, the
more hopeful they always became at the maiden's mansion.</p>

<h3>EXPECTING HEIRS.</h3>

<p class="indent">The doctor and Susan reckoned rather too confidently on
the inheritance of the aunt; for, even supposing that the dear old lady had
been so near to her beatification as her loving friends imagined, still
it was matter of speculation whether her dear niece would or would not
be her heir. The sighing pair of wedded lovers stood indeed most in
need of the inheritance: but it so happened that there was another
niece, married to one Lawyer Tweezer; not to speak of two nephews,
the Reverend Primarius Bugle, and a certain doctor of philosophy
of the same name. Their claims were all as strong as those of Susan
and her husband, and all looked forward with equal longing to the
ascension of the blessed virgin.</p>

<p class="indent">Bugle, the philosopher, had perhaps least cause of all.
He was rich enough; and, while enjoying the delicacies of his table, and
smacking his lips after his Burgundy, his philosophy was perfectly
edifying to his guests. We have a proof of his acuteness in a work
of his, in five volumes, now forgotten, but once immortal, entitled
"<i>The Wise Man surrounded by the Evils of Life</i>;" in which he proved
that there was no such thing as suffering in the world; that pain of
every kind was the mere creature of imagination; and that all a man
had to do, was to contemplate every object on the agreeable side.</p>

<p class="indent">Accordingly, he always contemplated his aunt on the <i>agreeable</i>,
namely, on her <i>money</i> side. He visited her assiduously, often invited
her to dinner, sent her all sorts of tit-bits from his kitchen, and was
accordingly honoured with the appellation of her "own darling nephew."</p>

<p class="indent">He would have succeeded well enough with his philosophy,
had not his cousin, the Reverend Primarius Bugle, by means of his theology,
exercised great influence over the aunt. She was very pious and devout,
contemned the vanities of the world, visited the congregations
of the godly, in which the spiritual bugle at times was heard to utter
a loud strain, and was mightily comforted by the visits of her reverend
nephew, who joined her frequently in her devotions, and gave her
pretty clearly to understand, that, without his assistance, she would
find it difficult to prepare her soul for its future blissful abode.
When, sighing and with weeping eyes, she would come from the edifying
discourses of her godly nephew, she would call him the saviour
of her soul, her greatest of benefactors, and promise to think of him
in her last hour. This was music to the ears of the theologian. "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
can scarcely fail to be the sole legatee," he would think to himself;
"or, as our pious aunt is wont to say, it would be a blue wonder indeed."</p>

<p class="indent">Nor would his calculation have been a bad one, but for his
cousin Lawyer Tweezer; whose legal ability made him a man of great importance
to the aunt. The chaste Sarah did indeed despise the
Mammon of unrighteousness, and sincerely pitied the grovelling children
of the world; but on that very account she did her best to detach
them from their Mammon, or at least their Mammon from them, which
is all the same. She lent money on high interest and good security,
and worked so diligently for the salvation of those who borrowed from
her, that they were always sure to became poorer and poorer under
her ministration. "Blessed are the poor!" she would exclaim when
they were paying her interest on interest; "if I could have my way,
I would have the whole town poor, that they might all inherit the
kingdom of heaven. The less people have in this world, the more
they will long for the world to come."</p>

<p class="indent">It would sometimes happen, however, that the pious maid was
carried too far by her virtuous zeal for the future welfare of her neighbours;
so that, what with her securities, and her compound interest,
and the wickedness of her debtors, she would occasionally find herself
involved in disputes and litigation. Without the aid of Lawyer
Tweezer, who was universally looked on as the most cunning pettifogger
in the whole town, she would frequently have seen interest
and principal slipping through her fingers. But, between her piety,
and his cunning and obduracy, a poor debtor was fain to bundle with
bag and baggage out of his house, rather than a single guilder she
had lent out, should miss its way back to her strong-box.</p>

<p class="indent">"I should be a poor, forsaken, lost woman, my dearest
nephew," she would often say to Tweezer, "if you were not there, to take
my part. I may thank you for nearly all I have; but the time may come
when I shall be able to repay you." This was music to the ears of
the jurist. He hoped one day to find himself sole heir, and fancied
he should be able to touch the right note when it came to the drawing
out of the will.</p>

<h3>THE PICTURE OF THE VIRGIN.</h3>

<p class="indent">Miss Sarah Bugle, in her fits of devotion, talked much of
death, and of her longings after the heavenly Jerusalem and her spiritual
bridegroom; yet this did not prevent her from thinking, even more
frequently still, of an earthly bridegroom. Since her five-and-fortieth
year she indeed solemnly declared that she never would marry;
nevertheless, she had her fits of maiden weakness, particularly when
some stately widower would banter her, or some gay bachelor look up
to her window as he went by. "I dare say he has some designs,"
she would then say. "Well, time will show; it's wrong to swear
anything rashly! If it is to be,&mdash;well; the Lord's will be done! I'm
in my best years. My namesake in the Old Testament was eighty
when she christened her first child. It would be no blue wonder if
it did turn out so!"</p>

<p class="indent">Thus she would soliloquize, particularly when some single man
had been looking kindly at her; and, as this seemed to her to be frequently
the case, she at last came to suspect every man in the place, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
"evil designs," as she called it, on her chaste person. At length,&mdash;for
her imagination had been wanton with her for more than twenty
years,&mdash;she came to look upon every single man as her silent adorer,
and every married man as her faithless one.</p>

<p class="indent">It may easily be conceived with what inveteracy she
declaimed against weddings of every kind, and how bitterly she abused
the whole godless, light-minded male sex, (for her quarrel was with
the whole sex,) and with what transcendent venom she inveighed against
the coquettish minxes who had the impudence to think of a man before
they were out of their leading-strings; though these same minxes
in leading-strings were all the while walking about in shoes such as
are generally manufactured for damsels about to bid adieu to their
teens.</p>

<p class="indent">Some elderly maidens, pure and pious like herself, assisted
her in the laudable occupation of prying into the domestic occurrences of
the town, and moralising over them while sipping their coffee. In
this conclave, every new gown, every wedding, every christening, was
conscientiously discussed; and no time was lost in dispersing the result
of their amiable confabulations through every corner of the town.
A saucy sign-painter being once called on to paint a picture of the
goddess of Fame, armed her with a bugle instead of a trumpet; and,
when some pre-eminent piece of scandal became current, it was customary
to say "the bugle has been sounded,"&mdash;by which it was intended
to indicate the quarter where the report originated.</p>

<p class="indent">If to these amiable qualities we add the extreme godliness
of the chaste Sarah, and her invincible partiality for compound interest,
it is not difficult to understand why, with the exception of the said ancient
maidens and the four expecting nephews, every creature was careful
to remain at a most respectful distance from her.</p>

<h3>THE CARES OF LIFE.</h3>

<p class="indent">She had not the least inclination to die. She was, therefore,
by no means displeased with the competition of the four faculties, for her
inheritance. Nobody gained by it more than herself. It brought her
the dainties of philosophy, the consolations of religion, the protection
of the law, and moderate doctor's bills. Doctor Falcon was as dear
to her as the others, but not a bit more so: only when some transitory
indisposition seemed to hint at the instability of everything
human, the doctor never failed to become, for the time, the dearest
of all her nephews.</p>

<p class="indent">"Quick doctor! Pray come immediately! Miss Sarah is
dying!" exclaimed one morning, the antiquated maid-servant of the aunt,
as she popped her head in at the door. "My lady has been looking most
wretchedly for some days."</p>

<p class="indent">Falcon was sitting, when this news came, upon his unpretending
sofa; and, with his arm round her waist, was endeavouring to console
his weeping Susan. He knew that Miss Sarah was not likely to be
very serious in her intentions of dying: so he promised the maid he
would come immediately, but remained nevertheless with his wife, to
console her.</p>

<p class="indent">But he had little success this time in his attempts at consolation.
Poor Susan wept more bitterly than ever; and the poor doctor sat beside
her, unconscious of the cause of her tears.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Come, be open-hearted to your husband, my dearest love," he
said; "you torture me,&mdash;you kill me,&mdash;to see you thus, while you conceal
from me the cause."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, then listen to me. Oh!"</p>

<p class="indent">"What further, my dear Susan? you said that before."</p>

<p class="indent">"We have four children."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, and the finest in the town, if I am not mistaken!
They are all so gentle, so amiable, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! they are little angels."</p>

<p class="indent">"You are right; they <i>are</i> angels, all of them. You do
not, I hope, grieve over the presence of the little angelic circle?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, my dear husband; but what is to become of the future?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, thou unbelieving Susan! Let us rely on Providence."</p>

<p class="indent">"It is difficult for us to bring them up decently.
The older they grow, the more they want."</p>

<p class="indent">"They have been growing older all this while,
and they have wanted for nothing as yet."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay; but, if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"What then?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Alas!" she sighed, and sobbed more bitterly than before.</p>

<p class="indent">"What then?" exclaimed the doctor, with undissembled anxiety.</p>

<p class="indent">She concealed her face in his bosom, clung to him with
both her arms, and, in a scarcely audible whisper, said:
"I am to be a mother for the fifth time."</p>

<p class="indent">The papa was half inclined to cry himself at this unhoped-for
announcement; however, he concealed his consternation as well as he
could. "Nay, sweetheart, is that all?" he exclaimed. "Come,
Susan, we shall have five little angels instead of four. We cannot
fail to be happy!"</p>

<p class="indent">"But, my dear husband, we are so very, very poor!"</p>

<p class="indent">"The little angels will bring a blessing upon us. He who
feeds the young ravens will also show me where to find a crumb for my little
ones. Come, tranquillise yourself."</p>

<p class="indent">Susan had had her cry out, and so became more tranquil,
as a matter of course; but the doctor had found no such vent for his
uneasiness. He walked up and down the room, looked out of the
window; nothing could divert his thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">"Every year more children and less bread! Every year
bigger boarders and thinner slices!" sighed he to himself. He would have
forgotten the dying Miss Bugle, had not Susan reminded him that it
was time to hasten to her death-bed.</p>

<h3>THE BLUE WONDER.</h3>

<p class="indent">He took up his hat, but he did not run. The little domestic
dialogue still weighed on his spirits. He thought only of the small
number of his patients, and the exhausted state of his exchequer.
He drew his hat over his brow, and looked straight before him like a
rhymester: on his way he saluted neither right nor left, and had
nearly run down the superintendent-general,&mdash;a man looked upon by
most people as one of the brightest shining lights in the church.</p>

<p class="indent">When he arrived at his dearly-beloved aunt's, he did not,
indeed, find her on her death-bed; but she had mounted her spectacles, and
was seated before a large book, from which she had opened at Reflections
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
on Death, and from which she was devoutly reading sundry Prayers
for the Dying. She looked wretchedly; but it would have been difficult
to say when her face looked anything else. Round her head she
had tied one handkerchief; and another, which passed over her head,
was fastened under her chin.</p>

<p class="indent">"What is the matter with you?" asked the learned
Doctor Falcon, as he laid his hat and stick aside.</p>

<p class="indent">"The Lord knows," sighed Miss Bugle in a soft and plaintive
tone; "I have suffered much for several days. I feel as if my hour
were come; and that would be terrible."</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor thoughtfully felt her pulse, and said unconsciously,
half to himself, "It fills, with a vengeance!" All the good man's thoughts
were at home with Susan.</p>

<p class="indent">"I thought as much," sighed the terrified virgin.
"Do you think there is danger, my dear Falcon?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not at your years," replied the doctor,
scarcely knowing what he said.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, that is some consolation," replied the lady in
a more cheerful tone; "in fact, I am in my best years; my strength
unbroken. My constitution must bring me through. Don't you think so,
dear Falcon? Only, no expensive medicines, if they can be done without.
Since bark, rhubarb, and mixtures have been turned into colonial
produce, there's no enduring them. The Lord be merciful to us!
but really, my dear Falcon, I am not at all well."</p>

<p class="indent">Our worthy aunt now gave the reins to her tongue; spoke,
as she was wont to do, of a thousand different things, none of them in any
way connected with her indisposition. The doctor, meanwhile,
hummed a tune, and beat the devil's tattoo upon the table, without
listening to a word of what the good lady was saying. At length he
was beginning to lose patience.</p>

<p class="indent">"What then <i>is</i> the matter with you?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, my appetite! I have not relished a spoonful of
soup these two days. And then my head aches as if it would burst."</p>

<p class="indent">"Something you have eaten has, perhaps, disagreed with you,
aunt; some philosophical <i>pâté de foie gras</i> may be in fault."</p>

<p class="indent">"Gracious Heaven! no, Falcon, the stomach cannot be in fault.
I live so simply, so frugally. Seriously, I don't think I have for several
weeks eaten anything likely to disagree with me. But sometimes I
have a tooth-ache, sometimes qualmishness, heartburn, vomitings&mdash;Good
Heavens! do look at me, Falcon, and don't keep drumming
upon the table so; look how pale I am,&mdash;how my eyes are sunk in
my head: oh dear! I am certainly very unwell."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, what do I care?" said the doctor in a peevish tone:
his mind entirely occupied by the condition of his Susan: "you're in the
family way, that's all."</p>

<p class="indent">"Merciful Heaven!" screamed the chaste virgin, in
a voice that might have been heard three streets off. Merciful Heaven!
that would be a blue wonder indeed!"</p>

<p class="indent">A cold sweat came over the doctor as he heard these
animated tones from the maiden lips of Miss Sarah Bugle. He immediately
recollected that, what with ill-humour, and what with absence of
mind, he had been betrayed into a superlatively foolish speech, and
one that no chaste virgin was ever likely to forgive; particularly a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
maid who had triumphantly preserved her painful dignity unimpaired
to her fiftieth year; one who never pardoned in another damsel even
a gentle pressure of the hand; one who was neither more nor less
than an immaculate personification of purity and sanctity; one who
was, in short, that virgin of virgins, Miss Sarah Bugle!</p>

<p class="indent">"I will let the storm vent itself, and seek safety in flight,
before the neighbours come pouring in, to see what's the matter," thought
the terrified doctor, as he opened the door and rushed into the street.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER BLUE WONDER.</h3>

<p class="indent">The other three faculties had by this time, by their jealousy,
rapacity, and endless misrepresentations concerning each other, utterly
ruined themselves in the good opinion of the virgin. Doctor
Falcon was the only one who at all bore up against the sudden
storm. He could not, for the soul of him, help laughing at his
own blunder. Susan, however, on the following day began to reprove
her husband's levity, though she had at first joined in the laugh at
his thoughtlessness. He caught her in his arms, stopped her mouth
with his kisses, and said, "You are right: I ought not to have so
rudely assaulted the maiden purity of the heaven-devoted vestal.
But, faith! when I left you yesterday, I scarcely knew myself which
way my head was turned."</p>

<p class="indent">"I would not say another word, my dear, if I were not
convinced that you have offended my aunt for ever. Such affront can never
be forgiven by so pious a maiden lady. It is ill for us, and particularly
now. We have a long winter before us. I heat the stove so
sparingly that the windows scarcely thaw the whole day, and yet our
stock of wood is going fast, as you know yourself. And for our exchequer,
look here!" So saying, she jingled a few small pieces of
silver in a large purse close to his ears.</p>

<p class="indent">A slight tap at the door, and Sarah's aged attendant entered
with a sealed note, and an urgent request from his aunt that the doctor
would without fail, immediately after dinner, precisely at one o'clock,
favour her with a visit.</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall be sure to come," said Falcon; he took the note,
and dismissed the maid.</p>

<p class="indent">He weighed the note in his hand, and turned jestingly to
his wife. "Feel, Susan; it is as heavy as lead." He opened it, and, lo! in
a Queen of Hearts sundry delicate incisions had been made, into which
had been slipped ten new full-weighted Dutch ducats. He looked
at the envelope; it was addressed to Dr. Falcon: there could be no
mistake. Such unheard-of liberality on the part of the immaculate
Sarah justly excited the amazement of the wedded pair.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, this is the bluest of all my aunt's blue wonders!"
exclaimed Falcon. "Come, my pretty one; how long is it since we had such a
treasure as this, in our house? Look! Providence watches over us
and our children. The winter is provided for; so we'll have no
more croaking. What! are you crying still?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!" sobbed Susan, as she threw her arms round his neck;
"it's for joy I am crying now. But," added she in a lower tone, "I was
praying fervently, nearly the whole night, for it was little I could sleep."</p>

<p class="indent">Falcon clasped his wife in his arms. He said not another word
for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
several minutes, but he wept inwardly; for he was unwilling that
she should see how deeply he was affected.</p>

<h3>BLUER AND BLUER.</h3>

<p class="indent">As the clock struck one, he stood by the bedside of the aunt.
With real emotion, with sincere gratitude, he approached her; and&mdash;he had
vowed to Susan he would do it&mdash;impressed a fervent kiss on the benevolent
hand that had just diffused so much joy through his little family circle.</p>

<p class="indent">"Best of aunts!" he said, "your present of to-day has made
Susan and me very happy."</p>

<p class="indent">"Dear nephew," said the sick lady, in the gentlest tone of
which her voice was capable, for it was long since her hand had been kissed
so warmly, "I have long, very long, been your debtor."</p>

<p class="indent">"And forgive me my rudeness of yesterday,"
continued the doctor.</p>

<p class="indent">Aunt Sarah modestly covered her face with her handkerchief.
After a while she said, but without looking at him, "Nephew, I am
about to repose unlimited confidence in you:&mdash;my life depends on
you. Can you be secret? Will you?"</p>

<p class="indent">Falcon was ready to promise everything. Still the lady was
not satisfied; she promised him her whole fortune if he would be faithful
to her. He made the most solemn oath.</p>

<p class="indent">"I know," said she, "that you young people are often
badly enough off. Well, I will come and board with you; for my old maid,
who has served me so long and so faithfully,"&mdash;here she sobbed
bitterly,&mdash;"I must turn her away. But as long as you keep my secret,
I will give you a thousand guilders every year for my board; and,
when I die, you shall have all I leave behind me."</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor fell on his knee by her bedside,
and renewed his oath with increased solemnity.</p>

<p class="indent">"But you must live outside the town; for I will not remain
here. I will make you a free gift of my large house outside the gate,
with the garden and all the grounds belonging to it. You know my
house close to the large inn&mdash;the Battle of Aboukir; the house was
left me six months ago, by my mother's brother, the Director of
Excise."</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor vowed with extended hand he would move into
it the very next day, in spite of wind, frost, and snow.</p>

<p class="indent">"As long as you keep my secret, nephew, I will pay you my
board half-yearly in advance; and for the little expenses you will be at, in
arranging your house for your own family and for me, you will find
four rouleaux of dollars in the little cupboard yonder behind the door."</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor swore all his vows of secrecy over again. She
must imagine the day of judgment or the millennium at hand, he thought.
Nothing less can possibly account for so sudden and miraculous a conversion.</p>

<p class="indent">But, with all this, Sarah came no nearer than before to
the confession of the great secret. As often as she attempted to begin, the
words died upon her lips, and she covered her face and sobbed.
These beginnings, and breakings off, and lamentations endured for a
long time. The doctor rose, seated himself by the side of the bed,
wiped his knees with the sleeve of his coat, took a pinch of snuff, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
said to himself, "We may pump a well dry in time!; it would be
hard if the lachrymal glands of an afflicted virgin could boast of an
inexhaustible store of water."</p>

<h3>THE BLUEST OF ALL.</h3>

<p class="indent">He was in the right: when she could cry no longer, she believed
she was recovering her Christian resolution, and said with a trembling
voice, "Nephew, when you left me yesterday after that dreadful expression&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor was about to fall once more on his knees:
"Pardon the expression, my angelic aunt! It was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, nephew; perhaps you were right."</p>

<p class="indent">"It was an unpardonable stupidity on my part."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, nephew; I believe you are not wrong."</p>

<p class="indent">"Impossible, my angelic aunt!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Alas! only too true, nephew."</p>

<p class="indent">"Impossible, aunt! And even if&mdash;even supposing&mdash;no,
aunt, you are certainly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nephew, you are right. I ought to have been wiser at my
time of life, you mean. You are right; but now you know all. The misfortune
has happened. I was married,&mdash;secretly, very secretly indeed,&mdash;but
all in an honourable way, all quite orderly. Now who'll
believe me? There he lies dead in the Tyrol, killed by a bullet;&mdash;here
are letters and vouchers. He is dead, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Who, aunt?" exclaimed Falcon in utter amazement.</p>

<p class="indent">"Alas! the trumpeter of the French regiment of hussars,
that was quartered here during the summer and autumn,&mdash;God be merciful
to his soul! He was no common trumpeter, but trumpeter to the regiment;
his father and grandfather beat the kettledrums for many
years with great applause. But, gracious Heaven! I could not bear
to be called a hussar's wife; and, before he could buy his discharge,
the regiment was ordered to march. Here I am now, a young widow,
not a soul knows it, not a soul would believe it. It will kill me
if it become known: it would be a blue wonder to the town. I care
little for the trumpeter; but my good name is all in all to me."</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor shook his head; he could scarcely recover
from his surprise. The trumpeter had indeed been frequently seen in Miss
Bugle's apartments; but Falcon, who had always laughed at Goethe's
idea of a chemical elective affinity, had never dreamt of such a
powerful elective affinity between a trumpeter and a Bugle. As to
the immediate uneasiness of the disconsolate maid, for such the widow
chose to be still called, he considered it groundless; but she
returned such strange replies to his questions as to her sensations,
that he began himself to have some suspicions. He had no difficulty
now in accounting for the munificence of the anxious lady, who
would rather have lost her life than that the whole town should have
known that the brightest mirror of all maiden virtue had been dimmed
and breathed upon.</p>

<p class="indent">He now pledged his word of honour that he would keep her
secret, and conceal her from all the world till she was able to appear again
with safety. Till then it was to be reported that she was ill; and,
under the plea of receiving more careful attendance, she was to live
at the doctor's house, and break off every other intercourse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The gift of the country-house near the large hotel of the
Battle of Aboukir was duly and legally executed; the country-house was entered
upon in the middle of winter; the maiden matron became invisible
there; and no one was allowed to wait on her, but Susan, whom she
had herself initiated into her mystery.</p>

<h3>GOOD RESULTS.</h3>

<p class="indent">"Well, to be sure," she would say to Susan in her cheerful
hours,&mdash;for it was impossible to be always in despair; and, as her niece
anticipated all her wishes, she had never felt herself half so comfortable
as in the bosom of this happy family,&mdash;"Well, to be sure, it is a
blue wonder, indeed, to think that I should come to this! Who would
have thought it! Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty
spirit before a fall. I believed myself too secure, and now I am chastened
for my pride. Oh, trumpeter! trumpeter!"</p>

<p class="indent">The event, meanwhile, had exercised a very salutary
influence on the maiden lady. Through very fear of betraying herself to
the curious eyes of her former companions and gossips, she weaned herself
from all intercourse with them, and acquired a taste for more
refined pleasures in the circle of Dr. Falcon's family. She continued,
indeed, rather too fond of all the tittle-tattle of the town; but then
she thought of her own weakness, and judged more charitably that of
others. She became so indulgent, so modest, nay, so humble, that
the doctor and his wife were completely amazed. The change of
circumstances and society,&mdash;the heroic resolution by which she had
divested herself of a part of her property,&mdash;the assurance of the doctor
that she was still rich enough to live at her ease,&mdash;all this had
effected so singular a change in her character, that she seemed to
live quite in a new world. She even abandoned all her usurious
dealings, which, to be sure, she would have found it difficult to
continue in her present seclusion.</p>

<p class="indent">The three faculties, meanwhile, were vomiting fire
and flame. The two Bugles were apparently reconciled, but only that they
might unite more vigorously in their hostility against the pettifogger,
who watched their every step for a plausible ground of action
against them. The philosopher wrote an excellent book against the
human passions; and the worthy ecclesiastic delivered every Sunday
most edifying discourses on the abomination of ingratitude, calumny,
envy, evil-speaking, and malignity. Both did much good by
their arguments, but their own gall became more and more bitter,
every day.</p>

<h3>THE PIOUS FRAUD.</h3>

<p class="indent">The winter passed away, and was succeeded by spring.
The warm days of summer were approaching. Dr. Falcon had very soon
obtained the conviction that his aunt had little cause for her
uneasiness. He had told her so, and had explained to her the real nature
of her indisposition. In vain: the erring vestal would on no account
be undeceived. Susan and her husband were at length obliged to
desist from every attempt to dispel the ridiculous illusion of Aunt
Sarah, who threatened that she should begin to doubt the doctor's
friendship. She seldom left her bed.</p>

<p class="indent">"She makes me uneasy," said Susan to her husband;
"at times I almost fancy her cracked."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"And she is so, in every sense of the word," said the doctor.
"It is hypochondria,&mdash;a fixed idea. My physic is of no avail against the
extravagancies of her imagination. I know of nothing I can do, unless
it be to drive away one fancy by substituting another. Suppose we
pass our child off upon her for her own."</p>

<p class="indent">"But will she believe it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"If she does not, it is of little consequence."</p>

<p class="indent">After a few weeks Susan appeared no longer in Sarah's room&mdash;it
had been so arranged by the doctor; and our aunt was informed that
Susan had had a misfortune.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is the child dead?" inquired Sarah.</p>

<p class="indent">"Alas!" replied the doctor.</p>

<p class="indent">"Alas!" rejoined the aunt.</p>

<p class="indent">One day before daybreak, Aunt Sarah was awakened in an
unusual manner. Her face was sprinkled with water, and strong scents were
held to her nose, till it seemed they were going to send her out of
the world by the very means apparently employed to bring her to life again.</p>

<p class="indent">She opened her eyes, and saw the doctor busy with her nose.</p>

<p class="indent">"Righteous Heaven! I am dying!&mdash;You are killing me! Nephew,
nephew, what are you doing to my nose?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush, aunt!&mdash;don't speak a word!" said the doctor with
a mysterious look; "only tell me how you feel yourself."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tolerably well, nephew."</p>

<p class="indent">"You have been insensible for four hours, aunt. I was uneasy for
your life; but it's all right now,&mdash;you are saved. A lovely child&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"How!" exclaimed Sarah, almost rubbing her nose from her face.</p>

<p class="indent">"A sweet little boy. Do you wish to see the pretty fellow? If
you will keep yourself tranquil, and not stir a limb, why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"But nephew&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have passed it off upon every one in the house
for my wife's child."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, nephew! your prudence, your assistance, your counsel!
Oh, you are an angel!"</p>

<p class="indent">Falcon went away. Aunt Sarah trembled all over with terror
and joy. She looked round her:&mdash;on the table were burning lights and
countless phials of medicine were strewn around. A woman brought
in the baby: it was in a gentle sleep. Sarah spoke not a word, but
looked at it long, wept bitterly, kissed the little creature again and
again; and, when it had been carried away, she said to the doctor,
"It is the living picture of the trumpeter to the French regiment&mdash;God be
merciful to him! It is his living picture&mdash;I say, his living picture!"</p>

<h3>CONSEQUENCES.</h3>

<p class="indent">After the prescribed number of weeks had been punctually
expended in the consumption of gruels and broths, the chaste Sarah
perfectly recovered her spirits, and tripped about the house more
cheerful and active than she had been for many years before. She
dandled the baby, would scarcely allow it out of her sight, and evidently
doted on it with unbounded tenderness. She had been successfully
cured of one ridiculous illusion, by one yet more ridiculous.
Overflowing with gratitude, her first visit out of the house was to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
church, and thence she proceeded to a lawyer to execute a deed of
gift of her whole fortune to Dr. Falcon; renewing for herself only a
large annuity by way of pocket-money. Between herself and the
doctor, to be sure, a secret article was drawn up, by which he bound
himself in due time to transfer half of her bounty to the little living
picture of the regimental trumpeter.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">In this way, the blue wonders of Miss Sarah
Bugle suddenly converted our Dr. Falcon into a rich man. The triumph of the
medical faculty was irrevocably confirmed; the more furiously did law,
theology, and philosophy rage against each other. They could not
forgive one another the loss of the expected legacy. Dr. Falcon was
readily excused, for he was innocent. With him, all parties were
ready to renew a friendly intercourse, for he was now one of the
wealthiest men in the town; and a wealthy man, or rather his money,
may at times be useful to the philosopher as well as to the jurist: and
to the theologian as much as to either.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<p class="f90">TO THE EDITOR OF <b>BENTLEY'S MISCELLANY</b>.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent space-above1">
<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In submitting for your inspection,
the poem which I now do myself the honour of forwarding to you, permit me to intimate to you
the origin of its composition, and to indulge in one or two remarks.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">The author is a particular friend of my own;
a gentleman who, marrying at a rather advanced stage in the journey of life,
was unexpectedly and agreeably presented with a small earnest of posterity in
the shape of a son. Parental feelings, like many other good things,
are better late than never; and it has often struck me that such feelings
are much stronger, considerably more fervent, and, indeed, a
great deal better when they do come late. Methinks the love of
grandfather, grandmother, uncle, great-aunt, and a whole <i>kit</i> of
cousins, is blended in the sexagenarian sire. It will be perceived, from
the affecting apostrophe or invocation, that my friend commenced his
poem with praiseworthy promptitude; and I do hope that its success
will be more than commensurate with his expectations. The youth
is now half-past six, in the morning of existence. I have, once only,
had the pleasure of meeting him. He entered his father's study
somewhat abruptly, mounted on a timber steed, which, I am advised,
he is already perfectly able to manage; and, immediately he opened
his mouth, with a raspberry-jam border to it, I perceived that he
would, at no distant day, become not only a worthy member, but an
undoubted ornament, of society. But this is from my present purpose.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">Your Miscellany, sir, professes to furnish materials
for the amusement and delight of the community; and hitherto you have acted up
to your professions. But were it not as well, allow me to suggest,
that you should combine instruction with amusement,&mdash;that you
should clear the heart as well as purify the liver&mdash;that you should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
attend to the mind at the same time that you tickle the midriff?
You must confess, when I remind you of it, that the rising generation
has strong claims upon you, which I am sure you will be anxious,
and indeed most happy, to allow. The Youth's New Vade-Mecum,
then, is a compendious manual of instruction, which cannot fail of
becoming permanently serviceable and efficient. Similar although I
allow it to be, in many respects, to certain "Guides to Youth" and
"Young Man's Best Companions" which have been published,
yet I cannot but think that the precision with which the precepts are laid
down in it, and the judicious manner in which they are conveyed, must
cause it very shortly to supersede all other works of the same nature.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">I enclose for your gratification the real name of the
author, and I grant you the discretionary power of whispering it to any grateful
parent (there may be many such) who would fain make the acquaintance
and cultivate the friendship of their benefactor: and I have the
honour to be, sir,</p>

<h2>A VISIT TO THE MADRIGAL SOCIETY.</h2>

<p class="indent">Everybody has heard of madrigals, and almost everybody
has heard of the Madrigal Society; but everybody does not know what
madrigals are, and almost everybody has <i>not</i> dined with the Madrigal
Society. Not that that ancient and respectable body is an exclusive
one,&mdash;keeping its good dinners for its own private eating, and its
good music for its own private hearing: its freemasonry is extemporaneous,
and a visitor is as welcome to the whole fraternity as to the
individual who may introduce him.</p>

<p class="indent">The Madrigal Society is the very Royal Exchange of musical
enthusiasm and good-fellowship, and certainly bears the palm away from
its "<i>fratelli rivali</i>." Its component parts are better amalgamated,
and the individuals composing them, appear to derive more thorough
enjoyment from their attendance, than in any other unions we have
seen of the same genus.</p>

<p class="indent">For example, at one (which shall be nameless) there is a
line of demarcation between the professional and non-professional members;
another is so numerous, that it is broken into fifty coteries, as in the
boxes of a chop-house; and another enthusiastic little knot of vocal
harmonists is so strongly impressed with the sense of one another's
capabilities, that the speechifying, and toasting, and returning thanks
take up a vast deal more time then the music.</p>

<p class="indent">Which of the thousand and one suggested <i>derivations</i>
of the <i>name</i> madrigal is the right one, is a question upon which we most
humbly beg to decline entering. Whether it owe its origin to some particular
feature in the words to which all secular <i>part music</i> was set at an
early period; or whether, as some impertinent commentator has suggested,
it be a compound of two English words, "<i>mad</i>" and "wriggle,"&mdash;the
one having reference to the ecstatic state into which the listeners
were thrown by their first performance, the other to &mdash;&mdash; But we dismiss
this as unworthy our consideration, and cut the question altogether.</p>

<p class="indent">A madrigal may, we think, be best defined as a composition
in general set to a quaint little poem on some amatory or pastoral subject,
with parts for a number of voices; the majority being for four or five.
An unceasing flow of these parts, a kind of "push-on-keep-moving"
principle, appears one of its strongest characteristics; one voice
taking up the strain ere another lays it down,&mdash;seldom moving in
<i>masses</i> or "<i>plain-song</i>" and with perhaps only one or two "<i>closes</i>"
(sometimes none) until the end. In the conduct of all this, a very
peculiar style of harmony is used. They are one and all imbued
with a quaintness, which all who have heard madrigals must have
felt, and could at once recognise; but which it is quite impossible to
define in anything less than a treatise, six volumes quarto at the
least,&mdash;a task upon which at present we have not the smallest intention
of setting to work.</p>

<p class="indent">So much for a definition: now for a test. The best confirmation
of the genuineness of a madrigal is, the fact of its <i>bearing the weight
of a great body of voices</i>; that is to say, instead of its producing its
proper effect, each part being sung (as in a glee) by one voice, the
number of singers may be increased to any extent. And this, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
all, is the true touchstone of first-rate choral writing. The "Creation"
of Haydn, and "The Last Judgment" of Spohr, unquestionably
produce their best effect in an orchestra of moderate proportions; but
to a chorus of Handel, or a madrigal of Gibbons, perfect justice could
only be done by a body of singers that would fill St. Paul's, or cover
Salisbury Plain.</p>

<p class="indent">We have dined. The cloth vanishes,&mdash;there is a pause,&mdash;the party
simultaneously rise from their chairs,&mdash;the waiters at last (thanks to
a long course of training, mental and bodily,) show signs of standing
still for the next five minutes,&mdash;perfect silence pervades the room,&mdash;when
lo! a gentle murmur of high voices steals upon the ear,&mdash;the
strain is quickly imitated a few notes lower,&mdash;the basses massively
close up the harmonious phalanx, and we recognise the imperishable
"Non nobis, Domine."</p>

<p class="indent">Sobered, not saddened, by the noblest of canons,&mdash;the most
melodious of those ingenious complexities,&mdash;a movement takes place among
the party. Do not suppose that the <i>singers</i> are going to the bottom
of the table, for in that case <i>nobody</i> would be left at the top; or,
<i>vice versâ</i>, to the top, for then the bottom would be deserted. You
find your neighbour to the right, has migrated to the other end of the
room, and your <i>vis-à-vis</i> has established himself in his place. After
being duly puzzled by so unexpected a move, it appears that, unlike
other convivial assemblages, the order of precedency is observed here
<i>after</i>, instead of <i>before</i> dinner; and that you must shift your position
according to your register, not of birth or baptism, but voice. "Order
is Heaven's first law," and the high and low characters around
you, class themselves accordingly, into altos, tenors, and basses.</p>

<p class="indent">This little preparatory bustle over, and everybody again seated,
there is a brief pause, which we devote to speculations,&mdash;not on the
character of our new right-hand man (above mentioned),&mdash;not on the
contents of the minute-book which the president spreads open before
him,&mdash;nor on the pile of tomes which almost exclude the bodily presence
of the vice,&mdash;nor on the gentleman who is going to propose a
new member,&mdash;but on the "<i>dints</i>" in the table before us. The tops
of all tables at all taverns are, and have been from time immemorial,
remarkable for an infinite number of indentations varying in size and
conformation. This peculiarity is not indigenous to the aforesaid
tables; they are supposed, at some distant period of their existence,
to have had faces as unruffled as others of their kind; but the eternal
succession of thumps from glasses, plates, knives and forks, approbatory
of speech, sentiment, or song, furrows their physiognomy with
deep, ineffaceable lines,&mdash;albeit neither of study, thought, nor sorrow.</p>

<p class="indent">The time has gone by for the autobiography of guineas, lap-dogs,
sofas, and sedan-chairs; birds and beasts no longer sport their apophthegms
to human ears; even the pot and kettle have done calling one
another names; "The Confessions of a Dinner-table, written by himself,"
would stand no chance now; a second edition of the life of
Mendoza would be as little likely to take the town. Dinner-tables,
like boxers, must count their bruises in silence. Yon deeply-indented
furrow, over which our wine is absolutely tottering, is evidently a
<i>memento</i> of the days when the feet were regularly knocked off the
wine-glasses, and they, like their holders later in the evening, lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
their power of standing alone; when <i>daylight</i> unendurable and
<i>heel-taps</i> impossible. No hand lacking the zeal of political excitement
could have inflicted so uncompromising a gash as the one near it.
Bees'-wax and turpentine have somewhat softened the sharpness of
its outline; but its existence is identified with that of the table itself.
And that succession of little "<i>dibbs</i>," evidently by the same hand,&mdash;what
are they, but an unceasing monument to some by-gone beau,
who thus tattooed his approval of the best of all possible
toasts,&mdash;"The Ladies!"</p>

<p class="indent">But our speculations are leading us astray; more especially
as the music-desks are before us, the books upon them, and "the boys"
arrived. And hark! the pitch-pipe&mdash;none of your whipper-snapper
German Æolians or waistcoat-pocket tuning-forks, but the veritable
pitch-pipe which has been in use since the year 1740&mdash;sounds the
note of preparation, and the order of the day begins in real earnest.</p>

<p class="indent">The Madrigal Society does not, as its name would seem
to imply, confine itself exclusively to compositions which come under the
designation of madrigal. The motett and the ballet, which are variations
of the some genus, come in for a share of its notice.</p>

<p class="indent">On referring to the book before us, for the number just
given out by the conductor, we find&mdash;a motett, Dr. Christopher Tye.
The baton falls, and we launch into the unexplored ocean of song before
us. What breadth in the harmonies! What stateliness in the progression
of the parts!&mdash;and what a depth of feeling under the incrustation
of these crabbed old modulations!</p>

<p class="indent">And now for a madrigal. Will it be "Lady, thine eye,"
or "Cynthia, thy song," or "Sweet honey-sucking bees?"&mdash;No: as we live,
it is "Die not, fond man!"&mdash;the noblest of them all.</p>

<p class="indent">And now, another motett; and now&mdash;but stay! here is
something unusual. The vice looks to the chair&mdash;the chair looks to the
vice. The vice, like the sun over a mountain, shows his head above the
wall of books before him, and prepares to make a speech. "Gentlemen,
I beg to call your attention&mdash;" But we have forgotten the form,
so we'll give the substance of his observations, which go to prove
that he has received a madrigal, according to the rules of the
society,&mdash;that is, anonymously,&mdash;which he has looked over, and
deems worthy of a trial. The parts, which are of course not in the book,
are distributed, and much good-natured speculation is afloat; for the
madrigalians, though conservatives, are not exclusives. We begin:&mdash;there
is a stoppage at the onset,&mdash;something was wrong in the parts,&mdash;it
is corrected, and we start once more;&mdash;the precipice is passed in
safety. Still it does not "go." There is no good reason why it
should not; and so it is tried again; is better understood, and "goes"
accordingly. A sealed paper is delivered to the chairman, who opens
it with much solemnity, and announces the name of the composer,
casting a most significant glance on an individual at one corner of the
table, who, for the last quarter of an hour, has been engaged in the
most unpleasing of all sedentary pursuits,&mdash;sitting upon thorns. We
drink his health; the individual rises, and for upwards of a minute
and some seconds, is supposed to occupy himself in making some
observations germane to the present subject, but which, from his state
of nervous trepidation, are quite inaudible.</p>

<p class="indent">The books are again in requisition. We draw on firms of centuries'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
standing, and our checks are duly honoured. The stately motett, the
graceful madrigal, and the sprightly ballet alternate in rapid succession.
What a contrast does this enthusiastic coterie present to the
listless audience of the concert-room or opera! No mob of apathetical
time-killers is here; but true and constant lovers of the
divine art, joining "with heart and voice" in strains to them as fresh
and beautiful as they were two hundred years ago!</p>

<p class="indent">Oh! how we might gossip about and speculate upon the old
fellows who treasured up for us this legacy of fine things. Talk of love for
their art!&mdash;!&mdash;think of Luca Marenjio, who wrote a thousand madrigals;
and Dr. Tye, who set to music the whole of "The Acts of the Apostles!"</p>

<p>The human voice is the noblest of all instruments. In the madrigal
it finds an exercise worthy of its powers. Music, as developed
through the medium of the voice, assumes a far more elevated and
poetical form than it ever presents through instrumental performance
even of the very highest character. Music is less essentially <i>music</i>,
coming through throats of flesh and blood than throats of wood or
metal; but it is something infinitely finer,&mdash;the unchecked emanation
of the human heart,&mdash;the current fresh from the well-springs of all
that is good and beautiful in man's nature.</p>

<p class="indent">The changeableness of fashion, the perishability of all
instrumental music, is of itself sufficient evidence of this. Five-and-twenty
years ago, the works of Pleyel were the delight of every musical coterie in
Europe; now, there is not one amateur in fifty who ever heard a bar of
his music. And as for the cart-loads of sonatas, gigues, pasacailles,
serenatas, follias, fugues, concertantes, and "jewells" of Dr.
Bull, Paradies, Scarlatti, Geminiani,&mdash;yes, even Handel and Mozart
themselves!&mdash;they are regarded in about the same light as an Egyptian
papyrus, or a loaf of bread from Herculaneum.</p>

<p class="indent">It is difficult indeed to conceive "The Jupiter Symphony,"
or the "Sonate Pathétique," food for the virtuoso; but assuredly "Dove
sono," "The Hallelujah Chorus," and "St. Patrick's Day," are as
imperishable as expression, grandeur, and sunshine themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">Sounds are the <i>body</i> of music, to which the voice gives
immortality and a <i>soul</i>. To put the voice on the same level as an
instrument, is to pit matter against mind,&mdash;"man against cat-gut."</p>

<p class="indent">There is a sense of personal enjoyment connected, too, with
pure vocal music performed in this manner, which it is quite impossible to
find in the theatre or concert-room. Our thoughts there, are perpetually
brought back to some technical matter, and our imagination
curbed by the audience, some individual association with the singers,
or the "mise de théâtre;" but here, sitting at our ease around the
table, with our "<i>part</i>" before us, joining in the harmony or not,
as we please,&mdash;our only care that the madrigal shall <i>go</i> well,
our only interruption a glance now and then at the enthusiastic faces
around us,&mdash;we feel truly "the power of sound," and that our pleasure
is without alloy.</p>

<p class="indent">Hold! there is a slight drawback on our pleasure,&mdash;perfection
is not to be found even in the Madrigal Society. Where are the ladies?
Oh, Madrigalians! with what countenance can ye, month after month,
and year after year, continue singing Fair Oriana's praise, and bewailing
the cruelty of your Phillises, and Cynthias, and "Nymph of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
Diana," when you thus close up the fountain of all your inspirations?
Is your by-law, forbidding all speechifying, a tacit confession of fear
lest some gallant visitor, fired with your own sweet songs, should
spring on his legs and propose "The Ladies"? Is this the reason why
ye only drink "The King," "The Queen," and&mdash;your noble selves?
Shame on ye!&mdash;where are the ladies?</p>

<p class="indent">The truth must be spoken at all times. Old as the world is,
it is not yet quite steady enough to "chaperon" the fair sex to meetings
like those of the Madrigal Society. True; we have pretty well got
rid of the six-bottle men, and gentlemen have ceased to return home
in wheel-barrows: still something more must be done ere the most
courteous of chairmen can with propriety propose a new member
with a soprano voice, or the most zealous of secretaries second him.</p>

<p class="indent">To do our friends justice, they have made a step in this
matter. At the annual festival, where the madrigals put on all their splendour,
the ladies <i>are</i> admitted; but, alas! they are perched up in a gallery
"all by themselves." And even this bird's-eye view of gentlemen
eating and drinking, comes, like "the grotto," only once a-year.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">But these knotty points should be agitated before
dinner. Let us turn to our books once again,&mdash;sing "The Waits,"&mdash;"One
fa la more,"&mdash;and then "Good-night!"</p>

<h2>REFLECTIONS IN A HORSE-POND.</h2>
<p class="f90">TIME&mdash;NIGHT.</p>

<p class="indent">Let me consider a little where I am! My senses are beginning
to clear at present, albeit my body is sticking in the mud, and seems to
think of nothing less. This plunge, disagreeable as it is, has been of
service to me: we should be thankful for everything, for they say
"everything is for the best;" and, upon this principle, a tumble into a
horse-pond may be a good. I shall, however, ascertain this better to-morrow
(that is, if I ever get out of the mud,&mdash;of which I am doubtful).
In the mean time I will, by way of passing the time, acknowledge my
obligation. I am a regenerated creature! Thanks be to Heaven! I
can see: before my tumble into these revivifying waters, my thoughts
were wandering, and my sight was dazzled; now they are fixed,
immoveably fixed,&mdash;to this horse-pond; and I only behold one moon
instead of two.</p>

<p class="indent">I do not exactly know how I came hither. I spent last
evening with Tom Rattlebrain, Ned Flighty, and Will Scamper; we had a
famous supper, and resolved to make a night of it. The weather was
hot, stormy, and goblinish; it led us to tell ghost-stories, which we
did till our marrow froze, and our parched throats cried out, like the
horse-leech's two daughters, "Give! give!" Purely to raise our
courage and moisten our palates, we had a couple of bottles additionally.
I recollect that after this we told some stories partaking more
of the flesh than the spirit, and that at two o'clock in the morning I
agreed to ride home on Daylight, hand in hand, like the fire-office
insignia, with Scamper, who was mounted on Wildfire. I remember
something of trying to force Daylight to cross that which I took to be
a ferry. I recollect something of our dispute upon this subject, but
faintly; I can only guess how the matter ended by the result,&mdash;for
he is gone, and I am <i>here</i>!</p>

<p class="indent">I suppose I must have struggled, flopped, and floundered
about a good deal before I could have been so firmly wedged in the mud as
I am at this moment. The water all around me is up to my chin, and
the mud beneath me is up to my knees; I have sunk considerably
above my calves. I really cut a very ridiculous figure!</p>

<p class="indent">The first thing I remember distinctly was seeing my lighted
cigar floating, fizzing, and spitting peevishly upon the water. Poor thing!
it did not relish regeneration. I put out my hand to catch it; but
it fizzed angrily, and floated away from me. This "was the unkindest
cut of all;" and when I saw its light go out, I felt as if abandoned by
all the world.</p>

<p class="indent">It just occurs to me that I have another cause of thanksgiving:
since one must sometimes fall into a horse-pond, I am grateful that it
is an English one. In some countries, now, those devils of the air&mdash;the
birds of prey&mdash;would keep wheeling, whirling, and shrieking
above my head, complimenting each other upon the good supper
prepared for them, and then coolly peck out my two eyes before my face!</p>

<p class="indent">This idea is suggested by a somewhat uncomfortable circumstance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
which, notwithstanding my patience, I cannot but be sensible of.
Something&mdash;I conjecture either an eel or a rat&mdash;is gnawing at the
boot on my right leg; no other animals venture so deeply into the
mud. I wish I could raise my foot.</p>

<p class="indent">If it be a rat, he will content himself with the leather,
and gnaw away till it be gone; but the eel prefers a bit of meat, and in that
case he is only busying himself to open his "pantry-door." Pray Heavens
it be a rat!</p>

<p class="indent">I am a most enduring man. I remember suffering infinite
misery a whole season at the house of a particular friend; I was lodged in
the best bedroom, and a superb apartment it was. The bed was a
magnificent one; but, to my cost, there was a flea in it,&mdash;"the last
flea of summer!" Never shall I forget what I suffered from that
single tormentor. I should have known it was only one, from the
peculiar pungency of his bite, even if the invariable character of the
mark had not also been a witness. The room had been for a long
period unoccupied, save by this flea, the survivor of all his family and
friends, who had died of starvation in the course of the summer. I
bore it patiently enough for several nights, thinking that it was a tax
to flea-manity which must be paid; but when, night after night, week
after week, the same torture continued, I began to grow nervous and
irritable. I sought after him diligently in the morning, but never
found anything save his trail. Like Destiny, he was always to be
felt, but never seen. In the night, scarcely had I torn the skin off
my shoulder, ere I was imperiously called upon to apply the same
remedy to my leg. I felt him hop across my hand as I raised it up;
and so rapid were his movements, that he seemed to be jumping in
every part of my body at once: like the Indian Apollo, he appeared
to have the power of multiplying his person, and of being in fifty
places at the same time. He was a single fiend "whose name was
Legion." I started in anguish; shook my sheets and my shirt; called
upon God, upon the devil; apostrophised the mistress of the house,
and mentally sent the housemaid to the hottest place I could think
of. It was all to no purpose; he seemed to have some extraordinary
power of disgorging his prey and clearing his stomach, which, like
Time, was always devouring,&mdash;never full. So rapidly did his constant
consecutive meals of breakfast, luncheon, dinner, tea, and supper
tread upon each other's heels, that I seemed to live twenty days in
one tortured night. I longed to complain to the master of the house;
but how tell him there was a flea in his best bed,&mdash;that bed in
which he took such pride, and beheld with so much admiration? At
length I met the housemaid on the stairs. She was as ugly as Repentance,
crabbed as Chastity, and old as Mother Shipton: nevertheless
I addressed her as "My dear little girl!" gave her a kiss and a
piece of money, and entreated her to kill the fleas in my bed. The
next day I met her, and she said, "There bean't no fleas in your
bed as now, sir." Alas! I knew that,&mdash;there was but one; and he
was a flea of Fate, beyond her power to destroy. Still the torture
went on; still did I lie, night after night, miserable, feverish,
sleepless, pinched, torn, and tortured in every part of my burning skin.
At length, considering the enormous power possessed by my tormentor,
his divisibility, his invisibility, his infallibility, I came at
last to the conclusion, that it was no living flea that thus distracted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
and disturbed me, but the ghost of some starved tenant of former
times, who was allowed this recreation to make amends for past
sufferings. This idea once established, I knew that I had no hope; I
had nothing for it but to fly: so I went to my friend, declared (to his
astonishment) my intention, and, when hard pressed for my reason,
painfully and reluctantly gave it. "A flea!" shouted he in a voice
between displeasure and mirth, "a flea&mdash;and in that bed!&mdash;<i>then
you must have brought it</i>!" Now was not this too much? I thought
my heart would have broken. I, who had endured so much&mdash;I, who
had suffered torture in silence for six long weeks, to be accused of
having brought that alderman of fleas with me! It was beyond
human nature to bear. I burst from his presence, packed up my
clothes, and, though I am a very good-tempered man, have not seen
that friend since. I can never forgive his accusation&mdash;I can never
forget what I suffered! As I call to mind that burning sorrow, I
take comfort in the knowledge that I am standing up to my neck in a horse-pond!</p>

<p class="indent">Thank you, gentle lady moon! I am grateful for any kind
of attention, even though it should be of no use to me; but yours is. I
wish I was a poet now!&mdash;I could make something of this scenery. I
have read a good deal about "moonlight on the waters;" but I never
was so near its dancing beams before. The devil take this rat&mdash;how
he nibbles! My boots are new&mdash;a hole in them at least! There's
a villanous odour that comes over me from some part of the horse-pond,
"at which my nose is in great indignation." It strikes me
also, from something uncomfortable in my stomach, that in my plunge
I must have swallowed a good allowance of Mark Anthony's liquor.
(<i>See</i> <span class="smcap">Shakspeare's</span> <i>Anthony and Cleopatra</i>,
Act 1, scene 4.) The bare idea is enough to make me faint;&mdash;only
who would be fool enough to faint in a horse-pond?</p>

<p class="indent">I have been in my life several times taken in,
besides to-night, by these waters.</p>

<p class="indent">Thank you again, dear gracious moon! She's very bright
just now. There is a large tract of blue in the heavens over which, for
at least the next twenty minutes, she may travel without being "capped
by a cloud;" so I shall have time to look around me. I am nearly
in the centre of the pond; the water is perfectly tranquil, except
when it bobs against my chin, disturbed by the movement of my
head. Lord help me! suppose I should die here!&mdash;as, if nobody come
to my assistance, I certainly shall.</p>

<p class="indent">On my first ascertaining the character of my position,
recollecting that horse-ponds are generally in the neighbourhood of towns or
farms, I hallooed so lustily that I found my voice grow husky; so I
determined to reserve it for a better occasion&mdash;I mean in case any
persons should approach&mdash;Heaven send them! This would be a
comfortless bed to die in!</p>

<p class="indent">A huge frog has just discovered me; and he sits amongst
the weeds below the opposite bank, croaking out his speculations as to
what I can be. He stares earnestly; so do I. He takes my eye for a
challenge&mdash;he is a frog of courage, however, for he plunges into the
water, swims towards me, and plants himself directly opposite to my
face. He croaks; I answer very naturally, for the water has qualified
my voice. The frog stares again: "The voice is the voice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
of Esau, but the form is Jacob's." Now he very gravely swims entirely
round my head, and then again plants himself in front. I laugh aloud;
he backs a little. I open my eyes very wide at him; he returns the
compliment. My chin splashes the water about him; he takes fright
and disappears.</p>

<p class="indent">Hark! there are certainly footsteps in the neighbourhood.
Halloo!&mdash;ough!&mdash;ah!&mdash;mercy upon me! my voice is quite gone,
and I shall be compelled to live in this horse-pond the remainder of my days.
Who will feed me, I wonder: the rat will not be so civil to me as the
ravens were to Elijah; and I have affronted the frog. Ha! the footsteps
come nearer&mdash;and nearer. 'Tis a man&mdash;I see him&mdash;a groom&mdash;I'll
call. Hallook!&mdash;ouk!&mdash;cro-ak!</p>

<p class="indent">"D&mdash;n your croaking soul!" quoth the vagabond;
and he flings a huge stone at my head.</p>

<p class="indent">Despair and distraction! what shall I do? Die! No, that's
cowardly: I'll live bravely; that is, if I can. The fellow is gone,
and "I am all alone!" Alone! What do I hear? Voices&mdash;yes;
they come&mdash;most sweet voices. A gentleman and the rascally
groom aforesaid.</p>

<p class="indent">"You have not dragged this pond to-night," says the master.</p>

<p class="indent">"Indeed, sir, we did,&mdash;from one end of it to the other,"
replies the fellow: "see how the weeds are disturbed."</p>

<p class="indent">"You lie, you rascal! you did not, or you would have found
me there," said I.</p>

<p class="indent">"Heighday!" cried the master; "what have we here?"</p>

<p class="indent">"A gentleman in distress."</p>

<p class="indent">"I should think so: but how came you in this pond?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll tell you when I am out."</p>

<p class="indent">"Help, all of you, fellows!" says the gentleman. "Now,
sir, hold fast: I was in search of a drunken uncle who has escaped from his
servants. Pull away, boys!&mdash;I expected to find him in this horse-pond,
and I discover a sober gentleman in his place."</p>

<p class="indent">N.B.&emsp;I did not think it necessary to
rectify this latter mistake.</p>

<p class="indent">My last, left the gallant Spankaway with her three topmasts
over the side; and a very natural question arises, "How did it happen?"
Her commander was as smart an officer as ever lived; an excellent
disciplinarian when on duty, a thoroughly brave man, but not much
of a seaman;&mdash;he was of a happy turn of mind himself, and nothing
afforded him greater pleasure than to see everybody else, happy around
him. On service no one could be more strict; but he loved to see
his officers surround his mahogany; and not one amongst them
was more jovial than Lord Eustace Dash.</p>

<p class="indent">On the evening in question, Old Parallel had glanced at
the glowing clouds in the west; but the invitation to the captain's cabin
had driven the circumstances from his remembrance, and, whilst
clinging to <i>port</i>, he thought but little of a storm at sea.
Mr. Sinnitt was the lieutenant of the watch; but on such occasions,
when there was no apprehension of danger, the mate was allowed to
assume the command of the deck, and his superior joined his
messmates over the flowing bowl.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The evening was delightfully serene, and groups
of seamen clustered together; spinning yarns, conversing on things in general,
or singing songs in a low tone, so as not to disturb the sacred character
of the quarter-deck; where, however, the young gentleman left in
charge was drawing round him a little knot of favourite youngsters,
eager to take advantage of the relaxation of discipline. Some were
attentively listening to the hilarity going on in the captain's cabin,&mdash;for
the heat had rendered it necessary to open the skylights; others
were paying equal attention to the vocal talents of honest Jack, who,
if he did not possess quite so much grace or talent as his superiors,
made ample atonement for the deficiency by his peculiar and
characteristic humour. Here and there, the treasured grog was served
out with scrupulous exactness, exciting many a longing and envious
eye. As in communities on shore, every ship had its choice
spirits,&mdash;its particular and especial jokers, songsters, and tale-tellers&mdash;and,
not unfrequently, that pest to society, the plausible pettifogger,
whose head, like that of a Philadelphy lawyer, was constantly filled with proclamations.</p>

<p class="indent">The moon shone with a crystalline clearness, and the gentle
motion of the frigate threw the shadows of the people in corresponding
movements on the deck, resembling the <i>ombres Chinois</i> that delighted
us so much in boyhood. The look-outs were posted at their appointed
stations; some with a shipmate to bear them company&mdash;others
alone, and thinking upon merry England.</p>

<p class="indent">"I say, Bill!" uttered the captain of the forecastle, addressing
one of the men, as he was looking to windward from the cat-head&mdash;or, as
it was more generally termed, 'Old Savage's picture-gallery,'&mdash;"I
say, Bill! somehow or another I don't much like the looks o' the sky
thereaway; to my thinking it's some'at fiery-eyed."</p>

<p class="indent">"Gammon!" returned the man without moving from his
position, "I'd ha' thought you would have known better, Jem! Well, I'm
blowed if we mayn't live and larn as long as there's a flurry o' breath
in the windsel! Why, that's ounly the pride o' the sun, to show his
glory to the last; would you have him go out like a purser's dip,&mdash;a
spark and away?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, Bill, I loves to see a good sunset," rejoined the other;
"and I never see'd finer then what I've see'd in these here seas. It's
some'at strange to my thinking, though, messmate, that God A'mighty
should have made this part o' the world so beautiful, and yet have put
such d&mdash;&mdash; lousy, beggarly rascals to live in it! Look at them there
Italians, with no more pluck about 'em than this here cat-head!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Nay, shipmates," said the serjeant of marines, who had just
joined them, "you do yourselves injustice. I hope there is some pluck <i>about</i>
the cat-head, though there may be none in it. But you say right&mdash;perfectly
right, as it regards those lazy-roany; they are a d&mdash;&mdash; set, to
be sure! But, their women, Jem&mdash;their women! Oh! they're dear,
delicious, lovely creaturs!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Mayhap they may be to your thinking," responded the
captain of the forecastle rather contemptuously: "but give me a good,
hearty, right-arnest, full-plump, flesh-and-blood Englishwoman; and
none o' your skinny, half-starved, sliding-gunter-legged, spindle-shank
sinoreas for me!"</p>

<p class="indent">"You manifest a shocking want of taste, shipmate," returned
the serjeant, proudly, and bringing himself to a perpendicular. "The
Italian women are considered the most lovely in women the world."</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell that to the marines, ould chap!" chimed in a
boatswain's mate, who now made a fourth in the party. "The most lovely women
in the world, eh? Why, Lord love your foolish heart! I wouldn't give my
Mrs. Sheavehole for all that Italy could stow, take it from stem to starn."</p>

<p class="indent">"She's your wife, Jack, and the mother of your children," argued
the serjeant; "but that cannot make her a bit the more of a beauty."</p>

<p class="indent">"Can't it, though!" exclaimed the boatswain's mate, sharply,
and at the same time giving the mountain of tobacco in his cheek a
thorough twist. "If it don't, then I'm d&mdash;&mdash;! and, setting a case,
it's just this here: when we first came within hail of each other, she
was as handsome a craft as ever had God A'mighty for a builder;
every timber in her hull was fashioned in Natur's own mould-loft, and
she was so pinned and bolted together that each plank did its own proper duty."</p>

<p class="indent">"But she's declining in years, you know, Jack," urged the serjeant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
provokingly; "and though she might have been once handsome, yet
age is a sad defacer of beauty."</p>

<p class="indent">"And suppose it is a <i>facer</i> of beauty, it can't change
the fashion of the heart!" uttered the boatswain's mate. "But, that's just like
you jollies!&mdash;all for paint and pipe-clay. Now, Suke's as handsome to
me as ever she was; and when I sees her like an ould hen clucking
over the young uns, I'm blessed if I don't love her more than when
she saved me from having my back scratched by the tails o' the cat!
I know, when a craft is obliged to be unrigged and laid up in ordinary,
she don't look not by no manner o' means so well as when she was
all a-taunto, and painted as fine as a fiddle: but still, shipmates, she's
the same craft; and as for beauty, why, setting a case, it's just this
here: there's ould beauty, as well as young beauty; and it a'nt so
much in the figure-head, or the plank-shear, as having done your
duty once, and ready to do it again."</p>

<p class="indent">"All that <i>may</i> be very true, Jack," persevered the serjeant;
"but then, you must allow there is as great a difference in the appearance
of some women when compared to others, as there is in the build or rig of a vessel."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hearken to that, now!" responded the boatswain's mate.
"Do you think Jack Sheavehole wants to be told that a billy-boy arn't a
ninety-eight, or a Dutch schuyt a dashing frigate? But, look at
this here craft that now rolls us so sweetly over the ocean: arn't she
as lovely now as when she first buttered her bottom on the slips, and
made a bed for herself in the water? and won't she be the same
beauty when she's put out of commission, and mayhap be moored in
Rotten-row? Well, she's stood under us in many a heavy gale, and
never yet showed her starn to an enemy,&mdash;that's why I love her; not
for what she may do, but for what she has done."</p>

<p class="indent">"But, I say, Jack! it's just the time for a yarn," said the
captain of the forecastle. "Tell us how Suke saved you from the gangway."</p>

<p class="indent">"I wull, messmate&mdash;I wull," returned the other; "and then
this lubberly jolly shall see if I arn't got a good right to call her a beauty.
I belonged to the Tapsickoree, two-and-thirty; and, though I says it
myself, there warn't many more sich tight-looking, clean-going lads
as ould Jack Sheavehole&mdash;though I warn't <i>ould</i> Jack then, but a
reg'lar smart, active, young blowhard of a maintopman. Well, we'd
just come home from foreign, and got three years' pay and a power o'
prize-money; and so most o' the boys goes ashore on liberty, and carries
on till all's blue. This was at Plymouth, shipmates; but, as we
wur expecting to go round to Spithead, I saves my cash&mdash;'cause why?
I'd an ould father and mother, from whom I'd parted company when
a boy, and I thought, if I could get long leave&mdash;thinks I, mayhap I
can heave alongside of 'em, with a cargo o' shiners, and it'll cheer
the cockles o' their ould hearts to see their son Jack togg'd off like a
jolly tar, and captain of a frigate's maintop; and, setting a case, why
it's just this here: I didn't want anything on 'em, but meant to give
'em better ground-tackle to hould on to life by."</p>

<p class="indent">"That was very kind of you, shipmate," said the serjeant.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," continued the boatswain's mate, without heeding the
serjeant's observation, "I has a bit of a spree ashore at Dock, in course;
but soon arter we goes round to Portsmouth. I axes for long leave;
and, as I'd al'ays done my duty to Muster Gilmour's&mdash;he was first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
leeftenant&mdash;to Muster Gilmour's satisfaction, I gets my fortnight and
my liberty-ticket, and the large cutter lands me at Sallyport; so I
hauls my wind for the Blue Postes on the Pint, and enters myself
on the books of a snug-looking craft, as was bound through my native
village.&mdash;Well, shipmates, in regard o' my being on liberty, why, I
was a gemman at large; so I buys a few duds for ould dad, and a suit
of new sails, and some head-gear for the ould woman: for, thinks I
to myself, mayhap we shall cruise about a bit among the neighbours,
and I'll let 'em see we arn't been sarving the king or hammering the
French for nothin'. And, mayhap, thinks I, they arn't never got too
much to grub; so I gets a bag, and shoves in a couple of legs o' mutton
and a whole shole of turnips, a full bladder of rum, and, as I knew
the old uns loved cat-lap, there was a stowage of sugar and tea, with
a bottle o' milk; and, having plenty of the ready, I buys a little
of everything useful in the small way, that the ould chap at the
shop showed me: and, my eyes! but there was thousands of packages
twisted and twined in true-blue paper;&mdash;there was 'bacca, mustard,
snuff, salt, soft tommy, pepper, lickerice, matches, gingerbread,
herrings, soap, pease, butter, candles, cheese,&mdash;in short, something of
everything, not forgetting a Welsh wig and a mousetrap; and I'm blowed
if I warn't regularly fitted out for a three months' cruise! Well, by
the time I'd got all my consarns ship-shape, I twigs the signal for
sailing, and so I gets aboard; and in course, in regard o' my station
in the maintop, I goes aloft, as high as possible upon the upper-deck,
and claps myself upon the luggage; but when the governor as had
charge comes to take the twiddling-lines, he axes me to berth myself
on the fokstle, and so, not to be outdone in civility, or to make 'em
think I'd let slip my edication, I comes down, and goes forud, and
stows myself away just abaft the pilot; when we made sail, there
was a party o' liberty boys from the ould Hibernia gives me three
cheers, and I waves my bit o' tarpaulin, sports a fresh morsel o' 'bacca,
and wondered what made the houses and everything run past us so
quick; but I soon found out it was the craft&mdash;for I remembered the
comb of the sea did just the same when the frigate was walking along
at a spanking rate. So, for the first hour, I sits quiet and alone, keeping
a sharp look-out on the pilot, to see how he handled the braces,
rounding 'em in to starboard, or to port&mdash;for, thinks I to myself, it's
best to larn everything&mdash;'cause why? who can tell but Jack Sheavehole
mayn't some day or another command just sich a consarn of his
own! and how foolish he'll look not to know which way to shape
his course, or how to steer his craft! But, I'm blowed! shipmates, if
the horses didn't seem to savvy the thing just as well as the man at the
helm; for the moment he tauten'd the gear, the hanemals slued round
o' themselves all ship-shape, and Bristor-fashion."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, it was the <i>reins</i> that guided them,"
said the serjeant, laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">"Then I'm blessed if it was!" returned old Jack;
"for there warn't a drop o' <i>rain</i> fell that arternoon&mdash;it
was a bright, sun-shiny day."</p>

<p class="indent">"What you call twiddling-lines, they call reins," explained
the serjeant; "and the horses are steered by them."</p>

<p class="indent">"Mayhap so, brother,&mdash;mayhap so," responded the boatswain's
mate; "for I arn't much skilled in them matters&mdash;'cause why? I
never sail'd in one on 'em afore, and ounly once since;&mdash;the first was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
a happy trip, the last was melancholy; and Jack sighed like an eddy
wind in the galley funnel. "But, to heave a-head&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"A good look-out before, there!" shouted the mate of the watch,
from the quarter-deck, where he was showing his authority by thrashing
the youngsters.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, ay, sir!" responded the man at the cat-head; and then
added, in a lower tone, "They're having a jolly sheave-o in the cabin!"</p>

<p class="indent">"It's a sad heart as never rejoices!" said the captain of the
forecastle. "But, I say, Jack! I don't like the look o' that sky to windard."</p>

<p class="indent">"It's one of two things&mdash;a parting blush o' the sun,
or a gathering squall o' the night," returned the boatswain's mate; "but we've
no reason to care about it&mdash;'cause, why? we're all as snug as possible.
Well, shipmates, to get on with my yarn:&mdash;when we'd run a
league or two, out of Portsmouth, we hove to at a victualling port,
and I spied a signal for good cheer hanging out aloft; and so, without
any bother, I boards 'em for a reg'lar stiff Nor'-wester, more nor
half-and-half, and says I to the pilot, 'Yo-hoy, shipmate!' says I, 'come,
and set up the standing backstays o' your heart a bit; and here, ould
chap, is someut to render the laneard;' and so I gives him a share
out o' the grog-tub, that set his eyes a-twinkling like the Lizard lights
on a frosty night. Well, just as we were going to trip the anchor
again, a pretty, smart-looking young woman rounds to under our
starn and ranges up alongside; and she says to the pilot, says she,
'Coachman, what'll you charge to take me to &mdash;&mdash;?' and I'm blessed
if she didn't name the very port I was bound to!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, 'tis quite romantic, Jack!" said the serjeant;
"we shall, no doubt, have a love-story presently: but, I'll wager you my grog
to-morrow, I can tell you who the female was."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then, I'm blowed if you can!" retorted the boatswain's mate.
"Now, who was she, pray?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it a fair bet?" inquired the serjeant with a look
of conceited knowledge.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, she warn't a fair Bet, nor a fair Moll either," returned
old Jack surlily. "I thought you'd know nothing whatsomever about
it! for that's always the case when a jolly tries to shove his oar into
a seaman's rullock&mdash;'cause why? he don't savvy the loom from the blade."</p>

<p class="indent">The serjeant laughed. "I meant a fair wager&mdash;that is,
my allowance against yours to-morrow that I name the female."</p>

<p class="indent">"Done!" exclaimed the boatswain's mate; "and, shipmates,
I call you all to witness that everything's square and above-board."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, it was your Sukey, to be sure&mdash;Mrs. Sheavehole&mdash;anybody
could tell that," replied the serjeant.</p>

<p class="indent">"There&mdash;you're out in your chrissening, ould chap, as
you'll find presently," asserted the veteran; "and so you've lost your grog.
But, d&mdash;it! I'd scorn to take a marine's allowance from him, though
you richly desarves it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, heave ahead, Jack!" said the captain of the forecastle;
"make a clear run of it, and don't be backing and filling this fashion."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, ay, Jem, I wull, I wull," answered old Jack. "But,
I say, shipmate! just clap a stopper on the marine's chattering-gear whilst I
overhaul my log.&mdash;Oh, now I have it! Up comes the young woman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
and 'Coachman, what'll you charge no take me to &mdash;&mdash;?'&mdash;'Seven
shillings, ma'am,' says he.&mdash;'Carn't you take me for less?' axes she;
'I've ounly got five, and I am very tired with walking.'&mdash;'Not a
ha'penny less, ma'am,' says he, just as cool as an iceberg in Hudson's
Bay; 'carn't do it, ma'am.'&mdash;'Oh, do try!' says she, and I could see
sorrow was pumping the tears into her eyes; 'I would give you more
if I had it,' says she.&mdash;'Carn't help it, ma'am,' says ould surly-chops,
'carn't help it; grub for the hanemals is very dear.'&mdash;'Oh, what shall
I do!' says she so piteously; 'night is coming on, and it's a long
way to travel on foot; I shall sink under it: do take the money!'&mdash;'Werry
sorry, my dear,' says he, shaking his blubber head like a
booby, perched on a ratlin, 'werry sorry, but never takes under price.
You must use your trotters if you arn't never got seven bob.'&mdash;'Then
I'm d&mdash;if she does!' says I, 'for you shall carry her.'&mdash;'Gammon!'
says he, as spiteful as a pet monkey; 'who's to tip the <i>fare</i>?'&mdash;So I
ups and tells him a piece o' my mind, and axes him if he ever know'd
anything <i>unfair</i> by Jack Sheavehole, or if he thought I wanted to
bilk him out o' the passage-money.&mdash;'Will you stand the two odd
bob?' axes he.&mdash;'And d' ye think I won't stand as much as Bob or
Dick, or any one else?' says I in a bit of a passion. 'Avast, ould
chap!' says I; 'humanity arn't cast off the mooring lashings from my
heart yet awhile, and I hopes never will;' and so I gives him a
seven-shilling bit without any more palaver, and 'Come, my precious,' says
I, houlding out my fin, 'mount areevo;' but I'm blessed if she didn't
hang back till the pilot rung out for us to come aboard! And 'Lord
love you!' says I, 'you arn't afeard of a man-o'-war's-man, are you?'&mdash;Oh
no,' says she, brightening up for all the world like the sun
coming out of a fog-bank,&mdash;'Oh no; you have been my friend this
night, and God reward you for it!' So we soon clapped one another
alongside upon the break of the fokstle, and got to overhauling a little
smattering o' larning, by way of being civil, seeing as we'd ounly just
joined company. 'I'm thinking that's a pretty village you're bound
to,' says I in a dubersome way; 'I was there once,' says I, 'when I
was a boy about the height of a tin pannikin;' for, shipmates, I didn't
like to overhaul how I'd run away from home. 'Pray, is ould Martin
Joyce alive?' says I.&mdash;'He was when I left yesterday morning,' says
she; 'but he is confined to his bed through illness.'&mdash;'And the ould
woman.' says I, 'does she still hould on?'&mdash;'Yes,' says my companion;
'but she's lame, and almost blind! Well, I'm blow'd, shipmates,
if I didn't feel my daylights a-smarting with pain with the
briny water that overflowed the scuppers&mdash;'cause why? them there wur
my own father and mother, in the regard of my having been entered
on the muster-books in a purser's name, my reg'lar right-arnest one
being Jack Joyce. 'And what makes you cruising so far away from
port?' says I, all kindly and messmate-like.&mdash;'It's rather a long
story,' says she; 'but as you have been so good to me, why, I must
tell you, that you mayn't think ill of me. You shall have it as short
as possible.'&mdash;'The shorter the sweeter, my precious,' says I, seeing
as I oughtn't to be silent. Well, she begins&mdash;'Sister Susan and I
are orphans; and when our parents died, ould Martin and his dame,
having no children, took us under their roof.'&mdash;'No children!' says I.
'Why, I thought they had a young scamp of a son.' I said this,
shipmates, just to hear what she would log again me.&mdash;'Oh yes,' says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
she; 'but he ran away to sea when a boy, and they never heard from
him for many years, till the other day they received a letter from
Plymouth to say he was in the Tapsickoree frigate, and expected to
be round at Spithead before long. So, the day before yesterday, a
sailor passing through the village told us she had arrived; and so his
parents getting poorer and poorer, with his father sick and his mother
lame, I thought it would be best to go to him and tell him of their
situation, that if he pleased he might come and see them once more
before they died.'&mdash;I was going to say, 'God A'mighty bless you for
it!' but I couldn't, shipmates; she spoke it so plaintively, that I felt
sumeut rise in my throat as if I was choking, and I gulped and gulped
to keep it down till I was almost strangled, and she went on:&mdash;'So
yesterday I walked all the way to Portsmouth, and went aboard the
frigate; but the officer tould me there was no man of the name of Joyce
borne upon the books.'&mdash;'It was a d&mdash;lubberly thing!' says I, 'and
now I remembers it.'&mdash;'What,' says she, 'what do you mean?'&mdash;'Oh,
nothing, my precious,' says I, 'nothing in the world;' for I thought
the time warn't come for me to own who I was, and it fell slap across
my mind that the doctor's boy who writ the letter for me, had signalised
my right-arnest name at the bottom, without saying one word
about the purser's consarn of Sheavehole. 'And so you've had your
voyage for nothing,' says I, 'and now you're homeward-bound; and
that's the long and the short on it. Well, my precious, I'm on
liberty; and as ould Martin did me a kindness when I was a boy,
why, I'll bring up for a few hours at his cottage, and have a bit of a
confab consarning ould times.' And the young woman seemed
mightily pleased about it; so that by the time we got to &mdash;&mdash;, I'm
blessed if, in all due civility, we warn't as thick as two Jews on a
payday. Well, we landed from the craft, and away we made sail in consort
for ould dad's cottage; and I'm blessed if everything didn't look
as familiar to me as when I was a young scamp of a boy! but I never
said not nothing; and so she knocks at the door, and my heart went
thump, thump,&mdash;by the hookey! shipmates, but it was just as I've
seen a bird try to burst out of its cage. Presently a voice sings out,
'Who's there?'&mdash;and such a voice!&mdash;I never heard a fiddle more
sweeterer in the whole course of my life&mdash;'Who's there?' says the
voice, in regard of its being night, about four bells in the first
watch.&mdash;'It's Maria,' says my convoy,&mdash;'And Jack Sheavehole,' says
I. 'Heave ahead, my cherub! give us a clear gangway and no
favour.'&mdash;'Oh, Maria, have you brought him with you?' said a young
woman, opening the door; and by the light she carried in her hand,
she showed a face as beautiful&mdash;I'm d&mdash;if ever they carried such
a figure-head as that, in any dock-yard in the world!&mdash;'Have you
brought him with you?' says she, looking at me, and smiling so
sweetly, that it took me all aback, with a bobble of a sea running on
my mind that made my ideas heave and set like Dutch fisherman
on the Dogger-bank.&mdash;'No,' says Maria, with a mournful sough, just
as the wind dies away arter a gale&mdash;'No; there was no such person
on board the frigate, and I have had my journey for nothing.'&mdash;'Nonsense!'
says the other; 'you want to play us some trick. I know this
is he;' and she pointed to me.&mdash;'Lord love your heart!' says I, plucking
up courage, for I'd flattened in forud, and fallen off so as to fill
again,&mdash;'Lord love your heart! I'd be anything or anybody to please
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
you,' says I; 'but my name, d' ye mind, is Jack Sheavehole, at your
sarvice in all due civility. But let us come to an anchor, and then
we can overhaul the consarn according to Hamilton Moore.' So we
goes in; and there sat my poor ould mother by the remains of a fire,
moored in the same arm-chair I had seen her in ten years afore, and
by her side was an ould wheezing cat that I had left a kitten; and,
though the cabin-gear warn't any very great shakes, everything was
as clean as if they'd just washed the decks. 'Yo-hoy, dame!'
says I, 'how do you weather the breeze?'&mdash;'Is that my John?' says
she, shipping her barnacles on her nose, like the jaws of a spanker-boom
on the saddle; and then Maria brings up alongside of her, and
spins the yarn about her passage to Portsmouth, boarding the frigate,
finding that she was out in her reckoning, and her return with me;
and ould dad, who was in his hammock in the next berth, would have
the door open to hear it all. And I felt so happy, and they looked so
downcast and sorrowful, that I'm blessed if I could stand it any
longer: so I seizes Susan round the neck, and I pays out a kiss as
long as the main-t'-bowline, till she hadn't breath to say 'Don't;' and
then I grapples 'em all round, sarving out hugs and kisses to all hands,
even to the ould cat; and I danced round the chairs and tables so,
that some o' the neighbours came running in; and 'Blow me tight!'
says I, 'side out for a bend; here I am again, all square by the lifts
and braces!'&mdash;and then I sings,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Here I am, poor Jack,</span>
<span class="i2">Just come home from sea,</span>
<span class="i0">With shiners in my sack'&mdash;</span>
</div></div>

<p>and I whips out a handful of guineas from my jacket pocket,
and shows 'em,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Pray what do you think of me?'</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">'What! mother,' says I, 'don't you know me? Why, I'm
your true and lawful son Jack Joyce; though, arter I run away, the purser
made twice-laid of it, and chrissened me Sheavehole, in regard of his
Majesty liking to name his own children. Never say die, ould woman!
there's plenty o' shot in the locker. And come, lasses,' says I to
the young uns, 'one on you stand cook o' the mess;' and I empties
my bag on the floor, and away rolled the combustibles, matches, and
mutton, and mousetraps, and all, scampering about like liberty boys
arter a six months' cruise; and I picks up the bladder o' rum, and
squeezes a good drain into a tea-cup, and hands it to the ould woman,
topping up her lame leg while she drinks. And, my eyes! there
was a precious shindy that night: the ould uns were almost dying
with joy, and the young uns had a fit o' the doldrums with pleasure.
So I gets the big pot under weigh, and shoves in both legs o' mutton
and a full allowance o' turnips, and I sarves out the grog between
the squalls; and ould dad blowed a whiff o' 'bacca, and mother payed
away at the snuff; and nobody warn't never happy if we warn't happy
that night. Well, we'd a glorious tuck-out o' mutton, wi' plenty o'
capers; and arter that I stows the ould woman in alongside o' dad,
kisses the girls in course, and then takes possession o' the arm-chair,
where I slept as sound as a jolly on sentry."</p>

<p class="indent">"That's libellous!" exclaimed the serjeant somewhat roughly,
as if offended; "it is an unjust reflection, and is clearly libellous."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"It's all the same to ould Jack whose <i>bellows</i> it is,"
returned the boatswain's mate carelessly; "it's no lie, howsomever, for none
sleeps so soundly as a marine on duty. But I arn't got time to overhaul
that consarn now; I know I laid in a stock of 'hard-and-fast'
enough to last for a three weeks' cruise. Well, shipmates, we keeps
the game alive all hot and warm, and we sported our best duds, and
I makes love to Susan, and we'd a regular new fit-out at the cottage,
and I leaves fifty pounds in the hands of the parson o' the parish for
the ould folks, and everything went on, in prime style, when one day
the landlord of the public comes in, and says he, 'Jack, the lobsters
are arter you.'&mdash;'Gammon!' says I; 'what can them fellows want
with me?'&mdash;'Arn't your liberty out?' says he.&mdash;'I never give it a
thought,' says I.&mdash;'Where's your ticket?' says he. So I showed him
the chit; and I'm blessed, shipmates, but it had been out two days!
Well, there I was in a pretty perdiklement; and the landlord, says he,
'Jack,' says he, 'I respect you for your goodness to the ould uns;
though I suspects they arn't altogether the cause of your losing your
memory:' and he looks and smiles at Suke. 'Howsomever, the lobsters
are at my house axing about you; and I thought I'd slip out
and let you know, so that you might have time to stow away.'&mdash;'Thanky,
my hearty,' says I; 'but I'm blessed, shipmates, if I
warn't dead flabbergasted where to find a stow-hole, till at last I hits
upon a scheme to which Susan consented! And what do you think
it was, shipmates?&mdash;but you'd never guess! Why, Suke slips on a
pair o' my canvass trousers and comes to an anchor in the arm-chair
with a blanket round her, below, and I stows myself under her duds,
coiling away my lower stanchions tailor-fashion; and the doctor
coming in to see the ould folks, they puts him up to the trick, and so
he brings up alongside of her, and they whitens her face, to make her
look pale, as if she was nigh-hand kicking the bucket: and there I lay,
as snug as a cockroach in a chafing-mat, and in all due decency,
seeing as Suke had bent my lower casings hind part afore, and there
warn't a crack nor a brack in 'em. Presently in marches the swaddies,
and 'Pray whose cottage is this?' axed the serjeant as stiff as a
crutch.&mdash;'It is Martin Joyce's,' said Maria.&mdash;'Ay, I thought as
much,' says he: 'pray where is his son, Jack Joyce, or Jack Sheavehole?'
says he.&mdash;'He left us three days ago,' answered Maria, 'to join
his ship: I hope nothing has happened to him?'&mdash;'Indeed!' says the
serjeant. 'Now, pretty as you are, I know that you are telling me
what I should call a very considerable &mdash;&mdash;' Suke shrieked out, and
stopped what he was going to say: for, shipmates, she sat so quiet,
that, thinks I to myself, they'll find out that she's shamming; so I
gives her a smart pinch in an inexpressible part, that made her sing
out. Well, the long and the short on it, is, that the party, who were
looking out sharp for 'straggling money,' had a grand overhaul; but
the doctor would not let them interfere with Susan, who, he declared,
was near her cushionmong; and at last, being unable to find
me, they hauls their wind for another port.&mdash;Well, shipmates, as soon
as possible arter they were gone, why, Suke got rid of her trouble,
and forth I came, as full-grown and handsome a babby as ever cut a
tooth. But I warnt safe yet; and so I claps a suit of Suke's duds
over my own gear, and, being but a little chap, with some slutching,
and letting out a reef or two here and there, I got my sails all snugly
bent, and clapped a cap with a thousand little frills round my face,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
and a straw hurricane-house of a bonnet as big as a Guineaman's
caboose over all, with a black wail hanging in the brails down afore,
and my shoes scandaled up my legs, that I made a good-looking
wench. Well, I bid all hands good-bye. Suke piped her eye a bit;
but, Lord love you! we'd made our calculations o' matrimony, and
got the right bearings and distance, (else, mayhap, I should
never have got stowed away under her hatches,) and she was to join me at
Portsmouth, and we were to make a long splice of it off-hand; but
then, poor thing! she thought, mayhap, I might get grabbed and punished.
Up comes the coach; but the fellow wouldn't heave to directly,
and 'Yo-hoy!' says I, giving him a hail.&mdash;'Going to Portsmouth,
ma'am?' says he, throwing all aback, and coming ashore from his
craft.&mdash;'To be sure I am,' says I. 'What made you carry on in
that fashion, and be d&mdash;to you!&mdash;is that all the regard you have for
the sex?' says I.&mdash;'Would you like to go inside, ma'am?' says he,
opening the gangway port.&mdash;'Not a bit of it,' says I: 'stow your
damaged slops below, but give me a berth 'pon deck.'&mdash;'Werry good,
ma'am,' says he, shutting the gangway port again; 'will you allow
me to assist you up?'&mdash;'Not by no manner o' means,' says I. 'Why,
what the devil do you take me for! to think the captain of a
frigate's maintop can't find his way aloft!'&mdash;'You mean the captain
of the maintop's wife,' says Susan, paying me back the pinch I gave
her.&mdash;'Ay, ay, my precious,' says I; 'so I do, to be sure. God bless
you! good-b'ye! Here I go like seven bells half struck!&mdash;carry on,
my boy, and I'm blessed if it shan't be a shiner in your way!' And
so we takes our berths, and away we made sail, happy-go-lucky,
heaving-to now and then just to take in a sea-stock; and the governor
had two eyes in his head, and so he finds out the latitude of the
thing, but he says nothing; and we got safe through the barrier and
into Portsmouth, and I lands in the street afore they reached the
inn,&mdash;for, thinks I to myself, I'd better get berthed for the night and
go aboard in the morning. Well, shipmates, I parts company with the
craft, and shapes my course for Pint,&mdash;'cause I knew a snug corner in
Capstan-square, and I was determined to cut with all skylarks, in regard
o' Suke. Well, just as I was getting to steer with a small helm,
up ranges a tall man who had seen me come ashore from the coach,
and 'My dear,' says he, 'what! just fresh from the country?' But I
houlds my tongue, shipmates, and he pulls up alongside and grabs
my arm. 'Come, don't be cross,' says he; 'let me take you in tow;
I want to talk with you, my love.' I knew the voice well; and though
he had a pea jacket over his uniform-coat, and, take him 'half way
up a hatchway,' he was a d&mdash; good-looking fellow, yet nobody as ever
had seen him could forget them 'trap-stick legs;' and so, thinks I to
myself, Jack, you'd better shove your boat off without delay: for,
d'ye see, shipmates, I'd sailed with him when I was a mizen-top-mun
in the ould Stag, and I well remembered Sir Joseph Y&mdash;ke. But
I'm blessed if he didn't stretch out arter me, and sailed two foot to
my one; and 'Come, come, my darling,' says he, 'take an honest tar
for your sweetheart. Let's look at that beautiful face;' and he
catches hould o' the wail and hauls it up chock ablock; but I pulls
down my bonnet so as he couldn't see my figure-head, and I carries
on a taut press to part company. But, Lord love yer hearts! it
warn't no manner o' use whatsomever&mdash;he more than held his own;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
and 'A pretty innocent country wench indeed!' says he. 'What!
have you lost your tongue?'&mdash;'No, I'm d&mdash; if I have!' says I: for I
forgot myself, shipmates, through vexation at not being able to get
away. 'Hallo!' says he, gripping me tight by the shoulder; 'who
have we here?' I'm blessed, shipmates, if, what with his
pulling at my shawl, and my struggling to sheer off, my spanker boom
didn't at that very moment get adrift, and he caught sight of it
in a jiffy. 'Hallo!' says he, catching tight hold of the pig-tail,
and slueing me right round by it. 'Hallo!' says he, 'I never see an
innocent country wench dress her hair in this way afore;&mdash;rather a
masc'line sort o' female,' he says. 'Who the devil are you?' 'It's
Jack Sheavehole, your honour,' says I, bringing up all standing; and,
knowing his generous heart, thinks I, Now's your time, Jack; overhaul
the whole consarn to him, and ten to one but he pulls you
through the scrape somehow or other. So I ups and tells him the
long and the short on it, and he laughs one minute, and d&mdash;ns me for
a desarting willun the next; and 'Come along!' says he 'I must see
what Captain B&mdash;n will think of all this.' So he takes me in tow,
and we went into one of the grand houses in High-street; and 'Follow
me,' says he, as he walked up stairs into a large room all lighted up
for a sheave-o; and there wur ladies all togged out in white, and silver
and gold, and feathers, and navy officers and sodger officers,&mdash;a grand
dinner-party. 'B&mdash;n,' hails Sir Joseph, 'here's a lady wants you;'
and he takes me by the hand, all complimentary like, and the captain
of the frigate comes towards us, and I'm blessed if every soul fore
and aft didn't fix their eyes on me like a marine looking out for a
squall. 'I've not the pleasure of knowing the lady,' says the skipper;
'I fear, Sir Joseph, you're coming York over me. Pray,
ma'am, may I be allowed the happiness of seeing your countenance
and hearing your name?'&mdash;'I'm Jack Sheavehole, yer honour,' says
I, 'captain o' the Tapsickorees maintop, as yer honour well knows.'&mdash;'I
do, my man,' says he with a gravedigger's grin on his countenance:
'and so you want to desert?'&mdash;'Never, yer honour,' says I,
'in the regard o' my liking my ship and my captain too well.'&mdash;'No,
no, B&mdash;n,' says Sir Joseph, 'I must do him justice. It appears that
he had long leave, and onknowingly overstayed his time; so he rigged
himself out in angel's gear to cheat them devils of sodgers. I'll
vouch for the fact, B&mdash;n,' says he, 'for I saw him myself get down
from the coach&mdash;.'&mdash;'All fresh from the country, yer honour,'
says I.&mdash;'Ay, all fresh from the country,' chimes in Sir Joseph. 'He's
an ould shipmate o' mine, B&mdash;n, and I want you, as a personal favour
to myself to back his liberty-ticket for to-morrow. Such a lad
as this, would never desart the sarvice.'&mdash;'If I would, then I'm
d&mdash;! saving yer honour's presence,' says I. Well, shipmates, there
I stood in the broad light, and all the ladies and gemmen staring at
me like fun; and 'Come, B&mdash;n,' says Sir Joseph, 'extend his liberty
till to-morrow'&mdash;'Where's your ticket?' axes the skipper: and so,
in regard of its being in my trousers pocket, I hauls up my petticoats
to get at it; and, my eyes! but the women set up a screeching,
and the officers burst out in a broadside o' laughing, and you never
heard such a bobbery as they kicked up,&mdash;it was a downright reg'lar squall."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, squall indeed," said the captain of the forecastle:
"here it comes with a vengeance!" he bellowed out with stentorian lungs.
"Hard up with the helm&mdash;hard a-weather." In an instant the sea
was one sheet of foam; the wind came whistling like the rustling of
ten thousand arrows in their swiftest flight; a report like the discharge
of a heavy piece of artillery was heard forward, and away flew
the jib like a fleecy cloud to leeward. The frigate heeled over,
carrying everybody and everything into the lee scuppers; the lightning
hissed and cracked as it exploded between the masts, making
everything tremble from the keel to the truck; broad sheets of water
were lifted up and dashed over the decks fore and aft: indeed, it
seemed as if the gale were striving to raise the ponderous vessel from
the ocean for the purpose of plunging it into the dark abyss; a thick
mist-like shroud hung round her, alow and aloft, as she struggled to
lift herself against the tempest. The topsail halliards were let go;
but the nearly horizontal position of the masts prevented the sails
from running down. Inevitable destruction for the moment threatened
to engulph them all, when "crack, crack, crack!" away
went the topmasts over the side; the spanker sheet had been cut
away, and off bounced the spanker after the jib. The frigate partially
righted, and Lord Eustace and his officers rushed to the deck.
But the squall had passed: the moon again shone beautifully clear;
the deceitful sky and still more deceitful ocean were all smiles, as if
nothing had happened,&mdash;though the evidences of their wrath were but
too apparent in the dismantled state of his Majesty's ship. But we
must again leave them, as we did before, to</p>

<h2>REMAINS OF HAJJI BABA.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="indent">Having bought some spangled stuffs for the trousers
of the harem of our exalted grand vizier, (upon whom be blessings!)
and despatched them, with letters, to the foot of the Shah's
throne by an express Tatar, I joined my Greek companions
at the Adrianople Gate, and left Constantinople for the country
of the Francs.</p>

<p class="indent">I found my new friends were raving with the new malady.
It seems that they now called themselves free,&mdash;a blessing which
they endeavoured to persuade me was beyond all price; for, as
far as I could learn from their definition of it, I found that now
they could wear yellow slippers, put on a green coat, and wrap
white muslin round their heads, without being called to account.
However, in order to secure these advantages, it appeared that
they were making no small sacrifices, for they were quarrelling
amongst themselves to their hearts' content; and that more
fell by the knives and stabs of their neighbours and countrymen
than ever in former times fell even by the despotism of their
Turkish rulers. Although I frequently asserted that quiet,
peace, and security from danger were great objects in life; yet
I found that I had a great deal to undergo before I could make
them agree to that plain fact; and at length, seeing that they
had made out a certain scheme of happiness of their own, the
principal ingredient of which, was the endurance of every thing
rather than to give power to the true believers, I allowed them
to enjoy it without further molestation.</p>

<p class="indent">After many adventures,&mdash;such as robberies by
Bulgars, an escape from shipwreck on the Danube, dislocation of bones
in little carts in Wallachia, incarceration within four bare
walls at the Austrian frontier on pretence of our being unclean
men, contamination from pork and wine among the Majars,
and disordered patience brought about by phlegmatic,
smoking, slow-driving, ya! ya! post-boys in Germany,&mdash;we
reached Vienna. It was a day upon which I frequently exclaimed
"<i>Ilham dulillah!</i>" the day when I first saw the lofty
spire of the great infidel church of that city; for I was tired of
everything: tired of my companions, tired of my eternal hot seat
in the corner of a coach, and longed to have a place to myself
where I might bless and curse at my pleasure whomsoever I
should like so to do.</p>

<p class="indent">My first care upon arriving here, was to inquire about
the object of my mission,&mdash;the state of England. Wherever I went, I
heard with a chuckle that she had had her day, that she was
going down fast, that too much prosperity was daily destroying
her; and every one added, with a sneer, "Ah, they thought
themselves the wisest of the sons of the earth; but see! they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
are its greatest fools, for they do not know how to keep what
they have got." One of the great proofs which I continually
heard brought forward of the decay of her power and wealth,
was the failure of an enterprise which to me was inexplicable,
but which, every one said, in her better days would never have
been abandoned. What I could make out of the story was
this:&mdash;It seems the Ingliz, in their madness, were tired of going
over their river in the common way,&mdash;that is, by bridges; and
so they determined to try a new way,&mdash;that is, to go under it.
Madness seized them; money poured in; they dug into the
bowels of the earth like moles; the workmen heard the river
flowing over them,&mdash;still they feared not, but dug on; at length
it broke in upon them,&mdash;still they cared not; they were drowned,&mdash;still
they dug. All the world was alive about it; everybody
thought of the pleasure of cheating the old bridges, and
the nation seemed charmed that they had found a totally novel
mode of getting from one side of a river to another, without going
over it, when, all at once, symptoms of decay broke out.
They had got halfway when the work stopped; and the whole
population, putting the finger of astonishment into the mouth
of disappointment, went home, and, stepping over their thresholds
with their right legs instead of their left, waited for a
return of good-luck&mdash;but it came not; their luck evidently has
turned, and there is the half-finished hole to attest it. "Poor
Ingliz!" thought I, when I heard this; "where are now my
old friends the Hoggs, my moon-faced Bessy, and her infidel
Figsby? Shall I find them again? perhaps they may have
been lost, with many others, in the mad enterprise of digging
this great hole under their river!"</p>

<p class="indent">I left my Greeks at Vienna, and, taking a place in
a moving caravan on wheels, called a diligence, but which went slower
than one of our strings of camels, I travelled onwards through
towns, cities, hamlets,&mdash;through forests, over rivers, over
mountains peopled by various tribes of Francs, all indifferent about
showing their women's faces, eating the unclean beast, drinking
wine, shaving and washing just as they pleased: ignorant of
the blessed Koran, and staring wide when such a country as Iran
was mentioned to them. They all agreed in sneering at the
Ingliz, and assuring me that I should find that nation upon
their last legs, and their king with scarcely any power left him.</p>

<p class="indent">At length we reached the country of the French Francs.
Here I heard that they had got rid of two or three kings since
those days when I was last near them; and that, after having
sworn to maintain new governments as fast as they were made,
were now tired of the last king they had created, and were in
the full enjoyment of all the wretchedness naturally flowing
from change. I was told that they had been increasing in
wealth and respectability, until they lost their last king, when
their prosperity fell, as if by magic. Now, no man was certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
of the possession of his property even for a day; and every one
was obliged by turns to arm himself cap-a-pie, to do his duty
as a soldier, in order to secure public happiness at the point of
the bayonet.</p>

<p class="indent">We entered the happy city of Paris just at the moment
when a large band of well-dressed soldiers were firing upon a mob,
who were throwing large stones at them, and crying out, as the
words were interpreted to us, "Liberty for ever!" "Down with
the king!" This ceremony, we were assured, was performed
about once a month. I asked my companions in the coach
what they meant by liberty, but I found no one could give
me any intelligible explanation; for it seems the French had all
that they could possibly require, and that, if they wanted more,
it must be to live without laws, without a king, without religion,
and with a right to appropriate their neighbour's goods, or cut
their neighbour's throat.</p>

<p class="indent">I trembled from head to foot all the time that I lived
in this happy city, fearful of never being able to get out of it with a
whole skin; at length I made an effort, and, accompanied by
Mahboob, I took places in a travelling coach, and reached the
sea-side opposite to the coast of England. I was lucky to see
with my own eyes that this country was yet in existence after
the many accounts I had heard of its total destruction.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="indent">I crossed over from France to England, mounted
upon a species of dragon spouting smoke and exhaling fire, to which
the famous monster of Mazanderan, slain by Rustam the Valiant,
was a mere plaything. But&mdash;shall I say it?&mdash;the awful
sickness which seized me whilst performing this feat, so overpowered
me, that it was impossible for me, the slave of the
asylum of the universe, to put my instructions into execution,
and to write down in a book all the wonders which in part
came to my understanding on that auspicious day. I may confidently
assert that no follower of the blessed Ali ever suffered
so much in so short a time as I then did. I was first taken
from my French bed before the day began to dawn, and put upon
this English monster. As soon as its wings began to expand,
and to move through the waters, an universal tremor assailed
it, which communicated itself to me and all with me; and I continued
to be well shaken until I reached the shores of England.
Then I felt so giddy that I thought my head had got into the infernal
regions, until I soon became certain that my stomach had
followed it there also. There I lay groaning, making noises,&mdash;oh,
such noises!&mdash;that if they could have been wafted to the ear
of the king of kings, his heart would have smote him for having
placed his slave in this predicament! When I was told that
we were arrived, I soon was restored to myself, and hastened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
from the bowels of the monster to the light of heaven; and there,
indeed, I saw a town, and a castle, and living men and women,
and, truly, nothing indicating a ruined country and a desponding
people. We landed at this place. It was called Dover;
and as I was told, is famous for a recent controversy whether it
should be spelt with an <i>o</i> or an <i>e</i> in the last syllable.
From time immemorial it had possessed the <i>e</i>; but such was the
spirit of change that they had now transformed it into the
<i>o</i>, although the lovers of old customs and good order kept
to the old sacred <i>e</i>. "When that spirit seizes a nation, who
knows," thought I, "when changes begin, where they may end?"
If we were to hearken to all our enlightened sofis in Persia,
they would expunge many sayings in our blessed Koran; and,
as we have not a second prophet to direct us, one man's change
would be as good as another's. Bit by bit all would be upset;
we should not have a law left for our direction, and we should
finish by cutting each other's throats in order to settle which
was the best way to live.</p>

<p class="indent">I thought, however, that I could discover some
symptoms of beggary in the state of the country, by what happened when I
was first setting foot on the infidel shore. Two scrutinising-looking
Francs stood on each side of a board over which I was to
walk on stepping from the boat to land; and when I ventured to
do so, they stopped me, passed their hands over the protuberances
of my person, and were about to seize a cashmere shawl which I
wore round my waist, when I exclaimed, "The dogs are eating
dirt!" which brought some of my friends on board the packet
to my help. Explanations were made, and I was let pass.
These were officers of customs. "But," thought I, "is it possible
that this great nation can be brought to such a state of
want that it permits its officers to rob a poor stranger!" I was
told of odd things. It was hinted to me, that the burnt father's
whelps looked mightily hard at my beard, and that they
had hinted that, by rights, I ought to pay duty for it, as foreign hair.</p>

<p class="indent">Having landed, with Mahboob close at my heels,
we were almost crushed to death by a mob of ruffians, who took violent
possession of our persons, one pulling us one way, the other
the other, roaring the oddest words by way of congratulations
on first landing, which to this day I have not made out. "The
Ship!" bawled one; "York!" cried another; "Red Lion!" said
the next; "Blue Posts!" said the next. "<i>Be Jehanum!</i>" roared
I; and, at length, by dint of main force, I was rescued by
my friend in the packet, and taken safe into a caravanserai that
stood by the sea-shore. Here, indeed, the kindness shown me
by many men and women,&mdash;the bows, the dips, the smiles, the
sugared words which were lavished upon me, made up in part
for the rude sort of reception which I had hitherto experienced,
and the sunshine of satisfaction dawned over my heart. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
still a doubt hung about my mind; and I asked myself how it was
possible that I should all at once have become such an object of
tender interest and affection to a set of infidels who had never
seen me before,&mdash;who probably did not know whether Iran was
situated above the surface of the heavens, or within the bowels
of the earth,&mdash;who perhaps had never heard of the name of our
asylum of the universe, nor even of our blessed prophet? I
then reflected upon what had happened to us when we had
landed before, in England, and recollected that, at the end of
all things, there came a certain little odd-looking bit of paper
which the infidels called "bill," by virtue of which all their
civilities, all their kindness, all their apparent hospitality were
condensed into two or three crooked cyphers, and then converted
into sums of gold, whether the stranger was agreeable, or not
agreeable, to the transformation. I quite streamed from every
pore as I thought upon that moment of my retribution, for my
wits were my principal stock in hand; money being little, and,
I feared, credit less. However, as long as the civility lasted, I
was delighted, and I made as free a use of the caravanserai as
if it had been the Shah's Gate.</p>

<p class="indent">I never lost sight of the object of my mission. I
was delighted to have landed without having excited a suspicion of
the nature of my character; and, as England is the head-quarters for
curious men,&mdash;for, owing to her vast foreign possessions, she
imports them from all parts,&mdash;no one thought it strange that
two men with beards, with sheep-skin caps on, and mounted on
high-heeled green slippers, should arrive amongst them to take
a walk through their country. I was charmed, too, to have
created an interest in the breast of an infidel Englishman who
had been my fellow-passenger on board the packet. He was a
low, rotund man, of evident discretion in speech, the master
of moderation, and the lord of few words. There was no display
in his dress, for he buttoned himself up tight in his broadcloth
coat, exhibited no chains, and contented himself with a
rough stick with a hook to it. I found that he had been in
India,&mdash;where many English have been; and, when I could not
understand all he said to me in his own language, I was glad to
find he could explain himself fully by the help of some score of
indifferent Persian words. He had helped me out of the dilemma
with the custom-house officers, had rescued me out of the
fangs of the complimentary harpies, had installed me in the
caravanserai; and had thus gained a claim upon my gratitude.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">I had occasionally asked him about the state
of his country, but I had never been able to get more out of him than a shake
of his head. From what I could discover from the exterior
of things, certainly there was no indication of decay; and indeed,
compared with what I had observed in the other countries of
Europe, there seemed here to be an increased state of prosperity.
It was evident that I had been everywhere hoaxed upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
the declining state of England, and that envy alone had excited
the report spread to her disadvantage. When we talk of ruin
in Persia, we see it at once: villages without inhabitants, dry
water-courses, abandoned caravanserais, ragged and wan-looking
peasants, and tyrannical governors. But here I saw a
flourishing town, happy people, new buildings, busy faces, and
no appearance at all of governors. I remarked this to my infidel
friend: still he wagged his head, and talked of things unknown
to my understanding. The utmost I could draw from
him was, that he did not like <i>chopping and changing</i>. When I
had discovered the true meaning of these words I could not help
saying to myself, "Our Shah has long enough tried '<i>chopping</i>,'
without gaining prosperity, I wish he too would try <i>changing</i>;
he might perhaps succeed better." I, however, for the present
determined to keep my own counsel, and apply the opening
draught of inquiry to the malady of ignorance as often as such
relief came within my power.</p>

<p class="f110">SIR JOHN FALSTAFF.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"For those who read aright are well aware</span>
<span class="i12">That Jaques, sighing in the forest green,</span>
<span class="i10">Oft on his heart felt less the load of care</span>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">"<span class="smcap">Jack Falstaff</span> to my familiars!"&mdash;By that
name, therefore, must he be known by all persons, for all are now the familiars of Falstaff.
The title of "Sir John Falstaff to all Europe" is but secondary and parochial.
He has long since far exceeded the limit by which he bounded the
knowledge of his knighthood; and in wide-spreading territories, which
in the day of his creation were untrodden by human foot, and in
teeming realms where the very name of England was then unheard
of, Jack Falstaff is known as familiarly as he was to the wonderful
court of princes, beggars, judges, swindlers, heroes, bullies, gentlemen,
scoundrels, justices, thieves, knights, tapsters, and the rest whom he
drew about him.</p>

<p class="indent">It is indeed <i>his</i> court. He is lord paramount, the
<i>suzerain</i> to whom all pay homage. Prince Hal may delude himself into
the notion that he, the heir of England, with all the swelling emotions of
soul that rendered him afterwards the conqueror of France, makes a
butt of the ton of man that is his companion. The parts are exactly
reversed. In the peculiar circle in which they live, the prince is the
butt of the knight. He knows it not,&mdash;he would repel it with scorn
if it were asserted; but it is nevertheless the fact that he is subdued.
He calls the course of life which he leads, the unyoked humour
of his idleness; but he mistakes. In all the paths where his journey
lies with Falstaff, it is the hard-yoked servitude of his obedience.
In the soliloquies put into his mouth he continually pleads that his
present conduct is but that of the moment, that he is ashamed of his
daily career, and that the time is ere long to come which will show
him different from what he seems. As the dramatic character of
Henry V. was conceived and executed by a man who knew how
genius in any department of human intellect would work,&mdash;to say
nothing of the fact that Shakspeare wrote with the whole of the
prince's career before him,&mdash;we may consider this subjugation to Falstaff
as intended to represent the transition state from spoiled youth
to energetic manhood. It is useless to look for minute traces of the
historical Henry in these dramas. Tradition and the chronicles had
handed him down to Shakspeare's time as a prince dissipated in youth,
and freely sharing in the rough debaucheries of the metropolis.
The same vigour "that did affright the air at Agincourt" must have
marked his conduct and bearing in any tumult in which he happened
to be engaged. I do not know on what credible authority the story of
his having given Gascoigne a box on the ear for committing one of
his friends to prison may rest, and shall not at present take the trouble
of inquiring. It is highly probable that the chief justice amply
deserved the cuffing, and I shall always assume the liberty of doubting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
that he committed the prince. That, like a "sensible lord," he
should have hastened to accept any apology which should have relieved
him from a collision with the ruling powers at court, I have
no doubt at all, from a long consideration of the conduct and history
of chief justices in general.</p>

<p class="indent">More diligent searchers into the facts of that obscure time
have seen reason to disbelieve the stories of any serious dissipations of
Henry. Engaged as he was from his earliest youth in affairs of great
importance, and with a mind trained to the prospect of powerfully
acting in the most serious questions that could agitate his time,&mdash;a
disputed succession, a rising hostility to the church, divided nobility,
turbulent commons, an internecine war with France impossible
of avoidance, a web of European diplomacy just then beginning to
develope itself, in consequence of the spreading use of the pen and
inkhorn so pathetically deplored by Jack Cade, and forerunning the
felonious invention, "contrary to the king's crown and dignity," of
the printing-press, denounced with no regard to chronology by that
illustrious agitator;&mdash;in these circumstances, the heir of the house
of Lancaster, the antagonist of the Lollards,&mdash;a matter of accident
in his case, though contrary to the general principles of his family,&mdash;and
at the same time suspected by the churchmen of dangerous
designs against their property,&mdash;the pretender on dubious title, but
not at the period appearing so decidedly defective as it seems in
ours, to the throne of France,&mdash;the aspirant to be arbiter or master
of all that he knew of Europe,&mdash;could not have wasted all his youth in
riotous living. In fact, his historical character is stern and severe;
but with that we have here nothing to do. It is not the Henry of
battles, and treaties, and charters, and commissions, and parliaments,
we are now dealing with;&mdash;we look to the Henry of Shakespeare.</p>

<p class="indent">That Henry, I repeat, is subject and vassal of Falstaff.
He is bound by the necromancy of genius to the "white-bearded Satan," who he
feels is leading him to perdition. It is in vain that he thinks it utterly
unfitting that he should engage in such an enterprise as the robbery
at Gadshill; for, in spite of all protestations to the contrary, he
joins the expedition merely to see how his master will get through his
difficulty. He struggles hard, but to no purpose. Go he must, and
he goes accordingly. A sense of decorum keeps him from participating
in the actual robbery; but he stand close by, that his resistless
sword may aid the dubious valour of his master's associates.
Joining with Poins in the jest of scattering them and seizing their
booty, not only is no harm done to Falstaff, but a sense of remorse
seizes on the prince for the almost treasonable deed&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">"Falstaff sweats to death,</span>
<span class="i10">And lards the lean earth as he walks along;</span>
<span class="i10">Wer't not for laughing, <i>I should pity him</i>."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">At their next meeting, after detecting and exposing the
stories related by the knight, how different is the result form what had
been predicted by Poins when laying the plot! "The virtue of this jest
will be, the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us
when we meet at supper: how thirty, at least, he fought with; what
wards, what blows, what extremities he endured; and in the reproof
of this lies the jest." Reproof indeed! All is detected and confessed.
Does Poins <i>reprove</i> him, interpret the word as we will? Poins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
indeed! That were <i>lèze majesté</i>. Does the prince? Why, he tries
a jest, but it breaks down; and Falstaff victoriously orders sack and
merriment with an accent of command not to be disputed. In a moment
after he is selected to meet Sir John Bracy, sent special with
the villainous news of the insurrection of the Percies; and in another
moment he is seated on his joint-stool, the mimic King of England,
lecturing with a mixture of jest and earnest the real Prince of Wales.</p>

<p class="indent">Equally inevitable is the necessity of screening the master
from the consequence of his delinquencies, even at the expense of a very close
approximation to saying the thing that is not; and impossible does
Hal find it not to stand rebuked when the conclusion of his joke of
taking the tavern-bills from the sleeper behind the arras is the
enforced confession of being a pickpocket. Before the austere king his
father, John his sober-blooded brother, and other persons of gravity
or consideration, if Falstaff be in presence, the prince is constrained
by his star to act in defence and protection of the knight. Conscious
of the carelessness and corruption which mark all the acts of his
guide, philosopher, and friend, it is yet impossible that he should not
recommend him to a command in a civil war which jeopardied the
very existence of his dynasty. In the heat of the battle and the
exultation of victory he is obliged to yield to the fraud that represents
Falstaff as the actual slayer of Hotspur. Prince John quietly remarks,
that the tale of Falstaff is the strangest that he ever heard:
his brother, who has won the victory, is content with saying that he
who has told it is the strangest of fellows. Does he betray the cheat?
Certainly not,&mdash;it would have been an act of disobedience; but
in privy council he suggests to <i>his</i> prince in a whisper,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Come, bring your luggage [the body of Hotspur] <i>nobly</i>&mdash;"</span>
</div></div>

<p>nobly&mdash;as becomes your rank in <i>our</i> court,
so as to do the whole of your followers, myself included,
honour by the appearance of their master&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:</span>
<span class="i10">For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,</span>
<span class="i10">I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Tribute, this, from the future Henry V.! Deeper tribute,
however, is paid in the scene in which state necessity induces the
renunciation of the fellow with the great belly who had misled him.
Poins had prepared us for the issue. The prince had been grossly
abused in the reputable hostelrie of the Boar's Head while he was
thought to be out of hearing. When he comes forward with the
intention of rebuking the impertinence, Poins, well knowing the command
to which he was destined to submit, exclaims, "My lord, he
will drive you out of your revenge, and turn all to merriment, if you
take not the heat." Vain caution! The scene, again, ends by the
total forgetfulness of Falstaff's offence, and his being sent for to
court. When, therefore, the time had come that considerations of
the highest importance required that Henry should assume a more
dignified character, and shake off his dissolute companions, his own
experience and the caution of Poins instruct him that if the thing
be not done on the heat,&mdash;if the old master-spirit be allowed one
moment's ground of vantage,&mdash;the game is up, the good resolutions
dissipated into thin air, the grave rebuke turned all into laughter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
and thoughts of anger or prudence put to flight by the restored supremacy
of Falstaff. Unabashed and unterrified he has heard the
severe rebuke of the king&mdash;"I know thee not, old man," &amp;c. until an
opportunity offers for a repartee:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"Know, the grave doth gape</span>
<span class="i10">For thee thrice wider than for other men."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Some joke on the oft-repeated theme of his unwieldy figure
was twinkling in Falstaff's eye, and ready to leap from his tongue. The
king saw his danger: had he allowed a word, he was undone. Hastily,
therefore, does he check that word;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Reply not to me with a fool-born jest;"</span>
</div></div>

<p>forbidding, by an act of eager authority,&mdash;what he must also have felt
to be an act of self-control,&mdash;the outpouring of those magic sounds
which, if uttered, would, instead of a prison becoming the lot of
Falstaff, have conducted him to the coronation dinner, and established
him as chief depositary of what in after days was known by the name
of backstairs influence.</p>

<p class="indent">In this we find the real justification of what has generally
been stigmatized as the harshness of Henry. Dr. Johnson, with some
indignation, asks why should Falstaff be sent to the Fleet?&mdash;he had
done nothing since the king's accession to deserve it. I answer, he
was sent to the Fleet for the same reason that he was banished ten
miles from court, on pain of death. Henry thought it necessary that
the walls of a prison should separate him from the seducing influence
of one than whom he knew many a better man, but none whom it
was so hard to miss. He felt that he could not, in his speech of
predetermined severity, pursue to the end the tone of harshness towards
his old companion. He had the nerve to begin by rebuking
him in angry terms as a surfeit-swelled, profane old man,&mdash;as one
who, instead of employing in prayer the time which his hoary head
indicated was not to be of long duration in this world, disgraced his
declining years by assuming the unseemly occupations of fool and
jester,&mdash;as one whom he had known in a dream, but had awakened to
despise,&mdash;as one who, on the verge of the gaping grave, occupied
himself in the pursuits of such low debauchery as excluded him from
the society of those who had respect for themselves or their character.
But he cannot so continue; and the last words he addresses to
him whom he had intended to have cursed altogether, hold forth
a promise of advancement, with an affectionate assurance that it will
be such as is suitable to his "strength and qualities." If in public he
could scarce master his speech, how could he hope in private to master
his feelings? No. His only safety was in utter separation: it
should be done, and he did it. He was emancipated by violent effort;
did he never regret the ancient thraldom? Shakspeare is silent: but
may we not imagine that he who sate crowned with the golden rigol
of England, cast, amid all his splendours, many a sorrowful thought
upon that old familiar face which he had sent to gaze upon the iron
bars of the Fleet?</p>

<p class="indent">As for the chief justice, he never appears in Falstaff's
presence, save as a butt. His grave lordship has many solemn admonitions,
nay, serious threats to deliver; but he departs laughed at and baffled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
Coming to demand explanation of the affair at Gadshill, the conversation
ends with his being asked for the loan of a thousand pounds.
Interposing to procure payment of the debt to Dame Quickly, he is
told that she goes about the town saying that her eldest son resembles
him. Fang and Snare, his lordship's officers, are not treated with less
respect, or shaken off with less ceremony. As for the other followers
of the knight,&mdash;Pistol, Nym, Bardolph,&mdash;they are, by office, his
obsequious dependents. But it is impossible that they could long
hang about him without contracting, unknown even to themselves,
other feelings than those arising from the mere advantages they derived
from his service. Death is the test of all; and when that of
Falstaff approaches, the dogged Nym reproaches the king for having
run bad humours on the knight; and Pistol in swelling tone, breathing
a sigh over his heart "fracted and corroborate," hastens to condole
with him. Bardolph wishes that he was with him wheresoever he
has gone, whether to heaven or hell: he has followed him all his
life,&mdash;why not follow him in death? The last jest has been at his own
expense; but what matters it now? In other times Bardolph could
resent the everlasting merriment at the expense of his nose&mdash;he might
wish it in the belly of the jester; but that's past. The dying knight
compares a flea upon his follower's nose to a black soul burning in
hell-fire; and no remonstrance is now made. "Let him joke as he
likes," says and thinks Bardolph with a sigh, "the fuel is gone that
maintained that fire. He never will supply it more; nor will it, in
return, supply fuel for his wit. I wish that it could." And Quickly,
whom he had for nine and twenty years robbed and cheated,&mdash;pardon
me, I must retract the words,&mdash;from whom he had, for the
space of a generation, levied tax and tribute as matter of right and
due,&mdash;she hovers anxiously over his dying bed, and, with a pathos
and a piety well befitting her calling, soothes his departing moments
by the consolatory assurance, when she hears him uttering the
unaccustomed appeal to God, that he had no necessity for yet troubling
himself with thoughts to which he had been unused during the
whole length of their acquaintance. Blame her not for leaving unperformed
the duty of a chaplain: it was not her vocation. She consoled
him as she could,&mdash;and the kindest of us can do no more.</p>

<p class="indent">Of himself, the centre of the circle, I have, perhaps, delayed
too long to speak; but the effect which he impresses upon all the visionary
characters around, marks Shakspeare's idea that he was to make
a similar impression on the real men to whom he was transmitting
him. The temptation to represent the gross fat man upon the stage
as a mere buffoon, and to turn the attention of the spectators to the
corporal qualities and the practical jests of which he is the object,
could hardly be resisted by the players; and the popular notion of
the Falstaff of the stage is, that he is no better than an upper-class
Scapin. A proper consideration, not merely of the character of his
mind as displayed in the lavish abundance of ever ready wit, and the
sound good sense of his searching observation, but of the position
which he always held in society, should have freed the Falstaff of
the cabinet from such an imputation. It has not generally done so.
Nothing can be more false, nor, <i>pace tanti viri</i>, more unphilosophical,
than Dr. Johnson's critique upon his character. According to him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"Falstaff is a character loaded with faults, and with
those faults which naturally produce contempt. He is a thief and a glutton,
a coward and a boaster, always ready to cheat the weak, and prey upon the
poor; to terrify the timorous, and insult the defenceless. At once
obsequious and malignant, he satirizes in their absence those whom
he lives by flattering. He is familiar with the prince only as an
agent of vice, but of this familiarity he is so proud, as not only to be
supercilious and haughty with common men, but to think his interest
of importance to the Duke of Lancaster. Yet the man thus corrupt,
thus despicable, makes himself necessary to the prince that despises
him, by the most pleasing of all qualities, perpetual gaiety; by an
unfailing power of exciting laughter, which is the more freely indulged,
as his wit is not of the splendid or ambitious kind, but consists
in easy scapes and sallies of levity, which make sport, but raise
no envy. It must be observed, that he is stained with no enormous
or sanguinary crimes, so that his licentiousness is not so offensive but
that it may be borne for his mirth.</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"The moral to be drawn from this representation is,
that no man is more dangerous than he that, with a will to corrupt, hath the
power to please; and that neither wit nor honesty ought to think themselves
safe with such a companion, when they see Henry seduced by Falstaff."</p>

<p class="indent">What can be cheaper than the venting of moral apophthegms
such as that which concludes the critique? Shakspeare, who had
no notion of copybook ethics, well knew that Falstaffs are not as
plenty as blackberries, and that the moral to be drawn from the
representation is no more than that great powers of wit will fascinate,
whether they be joined or not to qualities commanding grave esteem.
In the commentary I have just quoted, the Doctor was thinking of
such companions as Savage; but the interval is wide and deep.</p>

<p class="indent">How idle is the question as to the cowardice of Falstaff.
Maurice Morgann wrote an essay to free his character from the allegation;
and it became the subject of keen controversy. Deeply would
the knight have derided the discussion. His retreat from before
Prince Henry and Poins, and his imitating death when attacked
by Douglas, are the points mainly dwelt upon by those who make
him a coward. I shall not minutely go over what I conceive to be
a silly dispute on both sides: but in the former case Shakspeare
saves his honour by making him offer at least some resistance to
two bold and vigorous men when abandoned by his companions;
and, in the latter, what fitting antagonist was the fat and blown
soldier of three-score for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">"That furious Scot,</span>
<span class="i10">The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword</span>
<span class="i10">Had three times slain the appearance of the king?"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">He did no more than what Douglas himself did in the conclusion
of the fight: overmatched, the renowned warrior</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"'Gan vail his stomach, and did grace the shame</span>
<span class="i10">Of those that turned their backs; and, in his flight,</span>
<span class="i10">Stumbling in fear, was took."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Why press cowardice on Falstaff more than upon Douglas?
In an age when men of all ranks engaged in personal conflict, we find him
chosen to a command in a slaughterous battle; he leads his men to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
posts of imminent peril; it is his sword which Henry wishes to borrow
when about to engage Percy, and he refuses to lend it from its
necessity to himself; he can jest coolly in the midst of danger; he
is deemed worthy of employing the arm of Douglas at the time that
Hotspur engages the prince; Sir John Coleville yields himself his
prisoner; and, except in the jocular conversations among his own circle,
no word is breathed that he has not performed, and is not ready
to perform, the duties of a soldier. Even the attendant of the chief
justice, with the assent of his hostile lordship, admits that he has
done good service at Shrewsbury. All this, and much more, is urged
in his behalf by Maurice Morgann; but it is far indeed from the root
of the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">Of his being a thief and a glutton I shall say a few words
anon; but where does he cheat the weak or prey upon the poor,&mdash;where terrify
the timorous or insult the defenceless,&mdash;where is he obsequious;
where malignant,&mdash;where is he supercilious and haughty with common
men,&mdash;where does he think his interest of importance to the
Duke of Lancaster? Of this last charge I see nothing whatever in
the play. The "Duke" of Lancaster<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
is a slip of the Doctor's pen.
But Falstaff nowhere extends his patronage to Prince John; on the
contrary, he asks from the prince the favour of his good report
to the king, adding, when he is alone, that the sober-blooded boy
did not love him. He is courteous of manner; but, so far from being
obsequious, he assumes the command wherever he goes. He is jocularly
satirical of speech; but he who has attached to him so many
jesting companions for such a series of years, never could have been
open to the reproach of malignity. If the sayings of Johnson himself
about Goldsmith and Garrick, for example, were gathered, must he not
have allowed them to be far more calculated to hurt their feelings
than anything Falstaff ever said of Poins or Hal? and yet would
he not recoil from the accusation of being actuated by malignant
feelings towards men whom, in spite of wayward conversations, he
honoured, admired, and loved?</p>

<p class="indent">Let us consider for a moment who and what Falstaff was.
If you put him back to the actual era in which his date is fixed, and judge
him by the manners of that time; a knight of the days perhaps of
Edward III.&mdash;at all events of Henry IV.&mdash;was a man not to be
confounded with the knights spawned in our times. A knight then was
not far from the rank of peer; and with peers, merely by the virtue of
his knighthood, he habitually associated as their equal. Even if we
judge of him by the repute of knights in the days when his character
was written,&mdash;and in dealing with Shakspeare it is always safe to
consider him as giving himself small trouble to depart from the manners
which he saw around him,&mdash;the knights of Elizabeth were men of the
highest class. The queen conferred the honour with much difficulty,
and insisted that it should not be disgraced. Sir John Falstaff, if his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
mirth and wit inclined him to lead a reckless life, held no less rank
in the society of the day than the Earl of Rochester in the time of
Charles II. Henry IV. disapproves of his son's mixing with the
loose revellers of the town; but admits Falstaff unreproved to his
presence. When he is anxious to break the acquaintance, he makes
no objection to the station of Sir John, but sends him with Prince John
of Lancaster against the archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland.
His objection is not that the knight, by his rank, is no fitting
companion for a son of his own, but that he can better trust him with
the steadier than the more mercurial of the brothers.</p>

<p class="indent">We find by incidental notices that he was reared, when
a boy, page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, head of one of the greatest
houses that ever was in England, and the personal antagonist of him
who was afterwards Henry IV; that he was in his youth on familiar
terms with John of Gaunt, the first man of the land after the death of
his father and brother; and that, through all his life, he had been
familiar with the lofty and distinguished. We can, therefore, conjecture
what had been his youth and his manhood; we see what he actually
is in declining age. In this, if I mistake not, will be found the
true solution of the character; here is what the French call the <i>mot
d'énigme</i>. Conscious of powers and talents far surpassing those of
the ordinary run of men, he finds himself outstripped in the race. He
must have seen many a man whom he utterly despised rising over
his head to honours and emoluments. The very persons upon whom,
it would appear to Doctor Johnson, he was intruding, were many of
them his early companions,&mdash;many more his juniors at court. He
might have attended his old patron, the duke, at Coventry, upon St.
Lambert's day, when Richard II. flung down the warder amidst the
greatest men of England. If he jested in the tilt-yard with John of
Gaunt, could he feel that any material obstacle prevented him from
mixing with those who composed the court of John of Gaunt's son?</p>

<p class="indent">In fact, he is a dissipated man of rank, with a thousand
times more wit than ever fell to the lot of all the men of rank in the world.
But he has ill played his cards in life. He grumbles not at the advancement
of men of his own order; but the bitter drop of his soul overflows
when he remembers how he and that cheeseparing Shallow began
the world, and reflects that the starveling justice has land and beeves,
while he, the wit and the gentleman, is penniless, and living from
hand to mouth by the casual shifts of the day. He looks at the goodly
dwelling and the riches of him whom he had once so thoroughly
contemned, with an inward pang that he has scarcely a roof under
which he can lay his head. The tragic Macbeth, in the agony of his
last struggle, acknowledges with a deep despair that the things that
should accompany old age,&mdash;as honour, love, obedience, troops of
friends,&mdash;he must not look to have. The comic Falstaff says nothing
on the subject; but, by the choice of such associates as Bardolph, Pistol,
and the rest of that following, he tacitly declares that he too has
lost the advantages which should be attendant on years. No curses
loud or deep have accompanied his festive career,&mdash;its conclusion is
not the less sad on that account: neglect, forgotten friendships, services
overlooked, shared pleasures unremembered, and fair occasions
gone for ever by, haunt him, no doubt, as sharply as the consciousness
of deserving universal hatred galls the soul of Macbeth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">And we may pursue the analogy farther without any undue
straining. All other hope lost, the confident tyrant shuts himself up in
what he deems an impregnable fortress, and relies for very safety
upon his interpretation of the dark sayings of riddling witches. Divested
of the picturesque and supernatural horror of the tragedy, Macbeth
is here represented as driven to his last resource, and dependent
for life only upon chances, the dubiousness of which he can hardly conceal
from himself. The Boar's Head in Eastcheap is not the castle of
Dunsinane, any more than the conversation of Dame Quickly and
Doll Tearsheet is that of the Weird Sisters; but in the comedy, too,
we have the man, powerful in his own way, driven to his last "frank,"
and looking to the chance of the hour for the living of the hour. Hope
after hope has broken down, as prophecy after prophecy has been discovered
to be juggling and fallacious. He has trusted that <i>his</i> Birnam
Wood would not come to Dunsinane, and yet it comes;&mdash;that no man
not of woman born is to cross his path, and lo! the man is here.
What then remains for wit or warrior when all is lost&mdash;when the last
stake is gone&mdash;when no chance of another can be dreamt of&mdash;when
the gleaming visions that danced before their eyes are found to be
nothing but mist and mirage? What remains for them but to die?&mdash;And
so they do.</p>

<p class="indent">With such feelings, what can Falstaff, after having gone
through a life of adventure, care about the repute of courage or cowardice?
To divert the prince, he engages in a wild enterprise,&mdash;nothing
more than what would be called a "lark" now. When deer-stealing
ranked as no higher offence than robbing orchards,&mdash;not indeed
so high as the taking a slice off a loaf by a wandering beggar,
which some weeks ago has sent the vagrant who committed the
"crime" to seven years' transportation,&mdash;such robberies as those at
Gadshill, especially as all parties well knew that the money taken
there was surely to be repaid, as we find it is in the end,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
were of a comparatively venial nature. Old father antic, the Law, had not
yet established his undoubted supremacy; and taking purses, even in the
days of Queen Elizabeth, was not absolutely incompatible with gentility.
The breaking up of the great households and families by the
wars of the Roses, the suppression of the monasteries and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
confiscation of church property by Henry VIII, added to are adventurous
spirit generated throughout all Europe by the discovery of
America, had thrown upon the world "men of action," as they called
themselves, without any resources but what lay in their right hands.
Younger members of broken houses, or aspirants for the newly lost
honours or the ease of the cloister, did not well know what to do
with themselves. They were too idle to dig; they were ashamed to
beg;&mdash;and why not apply at home the admirable maxim,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"That they should take who have the power,</span>
<span class="i12">And they should keep who can,"</span>
</div></div>

<p>which was acted upon with so much success beyond the sea. The
same causes which broke down the nobility, and crippled the resources
of the church, deprived the retainers of the great baron, and
the sharers of the dole of the monastery, of their accustomed mode of
living; and robbery in these classes was considered the most venial of
offences. To the system of poor laws,&mdash;a system worthy of being
projected "in great Eliza's golden time" by the greatest philosopher of
that day, or, with one exception, of any other day,&mdash;are we indebted
for that general respect for property which renders the profession of
a thief infamous, and consigns him to the hulks, or the tread-mill,
without compassion. But I must not wander into historical disquisitions;
though no subject would, in its proper place, be more interesting
than a minute speculation upon the gradual working of the poor-law
system on English society. It would form one of the most remarkable
chapters in that great work yet to be written, "The History
of the <i>Lowest</i> Order from the earliest times,"&mdash;a work of far
more importance, of deeper philosophy, and more picturesque romance,
than all the chronicles of what are called the great events of
the earth. Elsewhere let me talk of this. I must now get back
again to Falstaff.</p>

<p class="indent">His Gadshill adventure was a jest,&mdash;a jest, perhaps,
repeated after too many precedents; but still, according to the fashion and
the humour of the time, nothing more than a jest. His own view of such
transactions is recorded; he considers Shallow as a fund of jesting to
amuse the prince, remarking that it is easy to amuse "with a sad
brow" (with a solemnity of appearance) "a fellow that never had
the ache in his shoulders." What was to be accomplished by turning
the foolish justice into ridicule, was also to be done by inducing the
true prince to become for a moment a false thief. The serious face
of robbery was assumed "to keep Prince Harry in perpetual laughter."
That, in Falstaff's circumstances, the money obtained by the
night's exploit would be highly acceptable, cannot be doubted; but
the real object was to amuse the prince. He had no idea of making
an exhibition of bravery on such an occasion; Poins well knew his
man when he said beforehand, "As for the third, if he fight longer
than he see reason, I'll forswear arms:" his end was as much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
obtained by the prince's jokes upon his cowardice. It was no matter
whether he invented what tended to laughter, or whether it was invented
upon him. The object was won so the laughter was in any
manner excited. The exaggerated tale of the misbegotten knaves in
Kendal-green, and his other lies, gross and mountainous, are told with
no other purpose; and one is almost tempted to believe him when he
says that he knew who were his assailants, and ran for their greater
amusement. At all events, it is evident that he cares nothing on
the subject. He offers a jocular defence; but immediately passes
to matter of more importance then the question of his standing or
running:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, lads, I'm glad you have the money. Hostess!</span>
<span class="i0">Clap to the doors; watch to-night, pray to-morrow.</span>
<span class="i0">Gallants, lads, boys, hearts-o'-gold! All the titles of</span>
<span class="i0">Good fellowship come to you!"<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>The money is had; the means of enjoying it are at hand.
Why waste our time in inquiring how it has been brought here, or permit
nonsensical discussions on my valour or cowardice to delay for a
moment the jovial appearance of the bottle?</p>

<p class="indent">I see no traces of his being a glutton. His roundness of
paunch is no proof of gormandising propensities; in fact, the greatest eaters
are generally thin and spare. When Henry is running over the bead-roll
of his vices, we meet no charge of gluttony urged against him.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">"There is a devil</span>
<span class="i0">Haunts thee i' the likeness of a fat old man;</span>
<span class="i0">A ton of man is thy companion.</span>
<span class="i0">Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours,</span>
<span class="i0">That bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swoln parcel of</span>
<span class="i0">Dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed</span>
<span class="i0">Cloakbag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox</span>
<span class="i0">With the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice,</span>
<span class="i0">That grey iniquity, that father ruffian,</span>
<span class="i0">That vanity in years? Wherein is he good</span>
<span class="i0">But to taste sack, and drink it? Wherein neat</span>
<span class="i0">And cleanly, but to carve a capon, and eat it?"<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The sack and sugar Falstaff admits readily; of addiction to
the grosser pleasures of the table neither he nor his accuser says a word. Capon
is light eating; and his neatness in carving gives an impression
of delicacy in the observances of the board. He appears to have
been fond of capon; for it figures in the tavern-bill found in his
pockets as the only eatable beside the stimulant anchovy for supper,
and the halfpenny-worth of bread. Nor does his conversation ever
turn upon gastronomical topics. The bottle supplies an endless
succession of jests; the dish scarcely contributes one.</p>

<p class="indent">We must observe that Falstaff is never represented as
drunk, or even affected by wine. The copious potations of sack do not cloud
his intellect, or embarrass his tongue. He is always self-possessed, and
ready to pour forth his floods of acute wit. In this he forms a contrast
to Sir Toby Belch. The discrimination between these two characters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
is very masterly. Both are knights, both convivial, both fond
of loose or jocular society, both somewhat in advance of their youth&mdash;there
are many outward points of similitude, and yet they are as distinct
as Prospero and Polonius. The Illyrian knight is of a lower class
of mind. His jests are mischievous; Falstaff never commits a practical
joke. Sir Toby delights in brawling and tumult; Sir John prefers
the ease of his own inn. Sir Toby sings songs, joins in catches,
and rejoices in making a noise; Sir John knows too well his powers
of wit and conversation to think it necessary to make any display, and
he hates disturbance. Sir Toby is easily affected by liquor and
roystering; Sir John rises from the board as cool as when he sate down.
The knight of Illyria had nothing to cloud his mind; he never aspired
to higher things than he has attained; he lives a jolly life in the
household of his niece, feasting, drinking, singing, rioting, playing
tricks from one end of the year to the other: his wishes are gratified,
his hopes unblighted. I have endeavoured to show that Falstaff was
the contrary of all this. And we must remark that the tumultuous
Toby has some dash of romance in him, of which no trace can be
found in the English knight. The wit and grace, the good-humour and
good looks of Maria, conquer Toby's heart, and he is in love with
her&mdash;love expressed in rough fashion, but love sincere. Could we
see him some dozen years after his marriage, we should find him sobered
down into a respectable, hospitable, and domestic country gentleman,
surrounded by a happy family of curly-headed Illyrians, and much
fonder of his wife than of his bottle. We can never so consider of
Falstaff; he must always be a dweller in clubs and taverns, a perpetual
diner-out at gentlemen's parties, or a frequenter of haunts where he
will not be disturbed by the presence of ladies of condition or
character. In the "Merry Wives of Windsor,"&mdash;I may remark, in passing,
that the Falstaff of that play is a different conception from the Falstaff
of Henry IV, and an inferior one,&mdash;his love is of a very practical
and unromantic nature. The ladies whom he addresses are beyond a
certain age; and his passion is inspired by his hopes of making them
his East and West Indies,&mdash;by their tables and their purses. No;
Falstaff never could have married,&mdash;he was better "accommodated
than with a wife." He might have paid his court to old Mistress Ursula,
and sworn to marry her weekly from the time when he perceived
the first white hair on his chin; but the oath was never kept, and
we see what was the motive of his love, when we find him sending
her a letter by his page after he has been refused credit by Master
Dombledon, unless he can offer something better than the rather
unmarketable security of himself and Bardolph.</p>

<p class="indent">We must also observe that he never laughs. Others laugh
with him, or at him; but no laughter from him who occasions or permits
it. He jests with a sad brow. The wit which he profusely
scatters about is from the head, not the heart. Its satire is slight,
and never malignant or affronting; but still it is satirical, and seldom
joyous. It is anything but <i>fun</i>. Original genius and long practice
have rendered it easy and familiar to him, and he uses it as a matter of
business. He has too much philosophy to show that he feels himself
misplaced; we discover his feelings by slight indications, which are,
however, quite sufficient. I fear that this conception of the character
could never be rendered popular on the stage; but I have heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
in private the part of Falstaff read with a perfectly grave, solemn,
slow, deep, and sonorous voice, touched occasionally somewhat with
the broken tone of age, from beginning to end, with admirable effect.
But I can imagine him painted according to my idea. He is always
caricatured. Not to refer to ordinary drawings, I remember one
executed by the reverend and very clever author of the "Miseries
of Human Life," (an engraving of which, if I do not mistake,
used to hang in Ambrose's parlour in Edinburgh, in the actual room
which was the primary seat of the "Noctes Ambrosianæ,") and the
painter had exerted all his art in making the face seamed with the
deep-drawn wrinkles and lines of a hard drinker and a constant
laugher. Now, had jolly Bacchus</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Set the trace in his face that a toper will tell,"</span>
</div></div>

<p>should we not have it carefully noted by those who everlastingly
joked upon his appearance? should we not have found his Malmsey
nose, his whelks and bubukles, his exhalations and meteors,
as duly described as those of Bardolph? A laughing countenance he
certainly had not. Jests such as his are not, like Ralph's, "lost,
unless you print the face." The leering wink in the eye introduced into
this portraiture is also wrong, if intended to represent the habitual
look of the man. The chief justice assures us that his eyes were
moist like those of other men of his time of life; and, without his
lordship's assurance, we may be certain that Falstaff seldom played
tricks with them. He rises before me as an elderly and very corpulent
gentleman, dressed like other military men of the time, [of Elizabeth,
observe, not Henry,] yellow-cheeked, white-bearded, double-chinned,
with a good-humoured but grave expression of countenance, sensuality
in the lower features of his face, high intellect in the upper.</p>

<p class="indent">Such is the idea I have formed of Falstaff and perhaps
some may think I am right. It required no ordinary genius to carry such a
character through so great a variety of incidents with so perfect
a consistency. It is not a difficult thing to depict a man corroded
by care within, yet appearing gay and at ease without, if you every
moment pull the machinery to pieces, as children do their toys, to
show what is inside. But the true art is to let the attendant
circumstances bespeak the character, without being obliged to label
him: "<i>Here you may see the tyrant</i>;" or, "<i>Here is the man heavy
of heart, light of manner</i>." Your ever-melancholy and ostentatiously
broken-hearted heroes are felt to be bores, endurable only on account
of the occasional beauty of the poetry in which they figure. We
grow tired of "the gloom the fabled Hebrew wanderer wore," &amp;c. and
sympathise as little with perpetual lamentations over mental sufferings
endured, or said to be endured, by active youth and manhood,
as we should be with its ceaseless complaints of the physical pain
of corns or toothache. The death-bed of Falstaff, told in the <i>patois</i>
of Dame Quickly to her debauched and profligate auditory, is a thousand
times more pathetic to those who have looked upon the world
with reflective eye, than all the morbid mournings of Childe Harold
and his poetical progeny.</p>

<p class="indent">At the table of Shallow, laid in his arbour, Falstaff is
compelled by the eager hospitality of his host to sit, much against his will.
The wit of the court endures the tipsy garrulity of the prattling
justice, the drunken harmonies of Silence, whose tongue is loosed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
by the sack to chaunt but-ends of old-fashioned ballads, the bustling
awkwardness of Davy, and the long-known alehouse style of
conversation of Bardolph, without uttering a word except some few
phrases of common-place courtesy. He feels that he is in mind
and thought far above his company. Was that the only company in
which the same accident had befallen him? Certainly not; it had
befallen him in many a mansion more honoured than that of Shallow,
and amid society loftier in name and prouder in place. His
talent, and the use to which he had turned it, had as completely
disjoined him in heart from those among whom he mixed, or might
have mixed, as it did from the pippin-and-caraway-eating party in
Gloucestershire. The members of his court are about him, but
not of him; they are all intended for use. From Shallow he borrows
a thousand pounds; and, as the justice cannot appreciate his wit,
he wastes it not upon him, but uses other methods of ingratiating
himself. Henry delights in his conversation and manner, and therefore
all his fascinations are exerted to win the favour of one from
whom so many advantages might be expected. He lives in the world
alone and apart, so far as true community of thought with others is
concerned; and his main business in life is to get through the day.
That&mdash;the day&mdash;is his real enemy; he rises to fight it in the
morning; he gets through its various dangers as well as he can; some
difficulties he meets, some he avoids; he shuns those who ask him for
money, seeks those from whom he may obtain it; lounges here, bustles
there; talks, drinks, jokes, schemes; and at last his foe is
slain, when light and its troubles depart. "The day is gone&mdash;the
night's our own." Courageously has he put an end to one of the
three hundred and sixty-five tormentors which he has yearly to endure;
and to-morrow&mdash;why&mdash;as was to-day, so to-morrow shall be.
At all events I shall not leave the sweet of the night unpicked, to
think anything more about it. Bring me a cup of sack! Let us be
merry! Does he ever think of what were his hopes and prospects
at the time, when was</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy,</span>
<span class="i10">And page to Thomas Mowbray, duke of Norfolk?"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Perhaps!&mdash;&mdash; but he chases away the intrusive reflection
by another cup of sack and a fresh sally of humour.</p>

<p class="indent">Dryden maintained that Shakspeare killed Mercutio, because,
if he had not, Mercutio would have killed him. In spite of the authority of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"All those prefaces of Dryden,</span>
<span class="i10">For these our critics much confide in,"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Glorious John is here mistaken. Mercutio is killed precisely
in the part of the drama where his death is requisite. Not an incident, scarcely
a sentence, in this most skilfully managed play of Romeo and Juliet,
can be omitted or misplaced. But I do think that Shakspeare was
unwilling to hazard the reputation of Falstaff by producing him again
in connexion with his old companion, Hal, on the stage. The dancer
in the epilogue of the Second Part of Henry IV. promises the audience,
that "if you be not too much cloyed with fat meat, our humble
author will continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
merry with fair Katharine of France; where, for any thing I know,
Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already he be killed with your
hard opinions."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
The audience was not cloyed with fat meat, Sir
John was not killed with their hard opinions; he was popular from the
first hour of his appearance: but Shakspeare never kept his word.
It was the dramatist, not the public, who killed his hero in the opening
scenes of Henry V; for he knew not how to interlace him with
the story of Agincourt. There Henry was to be lord of all; and it
was matter of necessity that his old master should disappear from
the scene. He parted therefore even just between twelve and one,
e'en at turning of the tide, and we shall never see him again until
the waters of some Avon, here or elsewhere,&mdash;it is a good Celtic
name for rivers in general,&mdash;shall once more bathe the limbs of the
like of him who was laid for his last earthly sleep under a gravestone
bearing a disregarded inscription, on the north side of the
chancel in the great church at Stratford.</p>

<h2>A STEAM TRIP TO HAMBURG.</h2>

<p class="indent">The world is about equally divided into two parts; viz.
the first and most unfortunate part, who have made trips by steam; and the
other, whose ill-luck is to come, and who have not yet been subject to
the "vapours." Both of these divisions of society will be equally
interested in my narration; one will see a faithful delineation of what
they have already suffered, and the other will be enabled clearly to
apprehend what, when their time comes, they will have to undergo.
Not that I wish to deter anybody from such undertakings, inasmuch
as there will be a degree of naval heroism in anybody who ventures
his person after he has become fully aware of his necessary calamities.
I need not say that this will give him a high station in society,
and that, if he announces in a tolerably loud voice at a dinner-table
that he has made a long trip by steam, more than one eye-glass will
be devoted to a survey of him. This is no mean advantage, and not
to be lightly lost.</p>

<p class="indent">Before I state what happened to me in particular,
I just wish to say half-a-dozen words about the sea in general.
The sea has been described by a great natural historian as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The sea! the sea!</span>
<span class="i0">The bright and open sea!"</span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, I differ from this description altogether. The sea is undoubtedly
"<i>the</i> sea,"&mdash;there's no denying that; but that it at all comes
up to the jaunty <i>débonnaire</i> character indicated by the rest of the
description, I absolutely traverse. In my mind it is a boisterous
"dissolute companion," whose bad example corrupts the most respectable
characters. Only see how our gentlemanlike, quiet old friend, Father
Thames, forgets himself when he falls into bad company. Gentlemen
from Shad Thames and the Barbican, who have been to Margate,
know very well what his conduct is. Instead of moving quietly along,
as he has done all the way from Lechlade in Gloucestershire, no
sooner does he get within hearing of the noise his bad acquaintance
is making, than it seems as if Old Nick possessed him. He begins
splashing, and dashing, and foaming about, just as if he had never
seen a weeping willow or the Monument in his life; and exchanges
his white-bait for porpoises, and his stately swans for cantankerous
sea-gulls, whose pleasure seems to increase in proportion to the tumult.
And, not contented with his own misconduct, he involves all
the gentle company he has brought with him in the common disorder:
there is the Loddon tossing about as if it had been a cataract all its
life; the Mole seems to forget all about Mickleham Valley, and how
quietly it has been accustomed to behave there; and the Kennet and
Avon, which have come all the way from the Wiltshire Downs,
where they were born in stillness among the Druids, take just as
much upon them, and are as noisy, as if they had derived their parentage
from a well-frequented metropolitan pump. No more need be
said to prove the audacious character of this "agitator," whose
inflammatory conduct makes everybody that comes in contact with
him, as bad as himself. I should not have said so much about it, but
I want to put down the sea, which, owing to gross misstatements and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
vile flattery, has acquired a credit and notoriety which it does not
deserve; and this ought to be stopped, as it misleads people.</p>

<p class="indent">Having made up my mind to go to Hamburg, I bade adieu to my
fond friends; and, having settled my London affairs, I prepared to go, and went.</p>

<p class="indent">At twelve <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> on the night of
Tuesday, August 13, 1836, it was my unhappy lot to emerge from hackney-coach
No. 369, the number of which I had taken, knowing the state of my mind, for
the better preservation of my valuables; fearing that, in my dread of approaching
evils, I might forget either my valued trunk or my respected hat-box.
Having emerged, my next act was, to ejaculate in as sonorous a voice
as my flabby energies permitted, "Boat a-hoy!"</p>

<p class="indent">This cry brought to me a waterman of an "ancient and fish-like"
appearance, who, for the filthy lucre of gain, agreed to transport my
person and packages on board the Steam Navigation Company's steam
ship, Britannia, carrying his majesty's mails, "warranted to perform
the journey in fifty hours;" with a steward on board, and numerous
other enticing particulars duly set forth in the bill of her
performances. For all these advantages, the Steam Navigation Company
expected no greater return than five pounds lawful money of Great
Britain,&mdash;an expectation which I satisfied to the proper extent, and
considered myself very fortunate.</p>

<p class="indent">Probably feeling much embarrassed by my gratitude on
this occasion, I must have betrayed some little passing emotion on ascending
the side of the vessel; as the naval person who offered me his hand as
an assistance, took occasion to observe, "Never mind, sir; you'll soon
be all right." Scarcely feeling entire confidence in this gentleman's
statement, I entered the "splendid saloon," on the tables of which
were the remains of certain spirituous liquors; faint and distant traces
of which, ascending from below, enabled me to attribute their
consumption to the various gentlemen there deposited, who were to
be my fellow-passengers. "Below" is a very nasty, unpleasant, underground
word of itself; but when it is coupled with the vile concomitants
which a sea "below" embraces, it is still more distasteful.</p>

<p class="indent">Diving down the stairs with the sad impression that I
had taken my last farewell of the upper world, I found my way to No. 14,
which was the number of the "berth" in which I was to bestow, and
did bestow accordingly, myself and luggage.</p>

<p class="indent">Before getting into bed, I thought I would see who and what the
victims were, who were to be offered up on a common altar with myself.</p>

<p class="indent">I could, however, see nobody, as the curtains were all closed;
and, therefore, trusting to the chance of finding somebody awake, I hazarded
the general inquiry of "I beg your pardon, sir; did you speak?"
There was, however, no reply; but certain of them snored lustily,
and one, more portly than his fellows, puffed withal as though he were
a grampus. Feeling I had made a vain attempt at opening a communication
with my neighbours, I was obliged to undress myself, and
get into bed with the unsatisfactory feeling that I might be drowned
in company with twelve or fourteen individuals without even knowing their names.</p>

<p class="indent">And here allow me to observe that different people appear
to have taken various views of the meaning of the term "bed," taken as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
simple term. One gentleman apprehends it to mean a four-posted,
ample convenience, provided with downy cushions and suitable appurtenances,
wherein he may roll himself about, at pleasure, and enjoy all
recumbent attitudes with freedom. Another, with less luxurious
views, erects a dormitory with a circular roof, of smaller size, and less
accommodations and comforts; and this, under the Christian name
of "tent," is his "bed." There are also other sorts of beds, each differing
from the others in comfort and appearance, in various degrees.</p>

<p class="indent">Most of these are extremely consistent with the personal
comfort of the individual adopting them; but the "bed-maker" of the crib
which I now occupied, had departed widely from all these well-approved
and convenient plans, and conceived the comforts of a bed
to consist in the following items:&mdash;one narrow, short trough of deal
or oak plank, as may be; one mattress of half the same size, stuffed
tightly with an unelastic, unyielding substance called "flock;" one oblong
pillow of the same material and consistency; two blankets rather
shorter than the mattress; two sheets rather shorter than the blankets;
one counterpane rather shorter than the sheets; each declining
in a sort of gradual progression, so that, if there had been fifty of them
the last would have ended in a piece of tape, or a penny riband.</p>

<p class="indent">Making myself into as small, and the clothes into as
large a heap as I could, just as one does with one's foot in a tight boot, I
tranquilly awaited our departure, which was announced as punctually
at two <span class="smcap">a.m.</span></p>

<p class="indent">I must do them the justice to say that there never was
an execution conducted more punctually to the moment for which it had been
promised. As the clock struck two, a clanking of chains, which
sounded just as if they were knocking off my fetters in another prison
for the last time, and a continued shouting and tramping overhead,
announced that they were weighing "the anchor." If it were half as
heavy as my heart, how it must have fatigued them! We could hear&mdash;or
rather I could hear (for it did not seem to wake the snorers or
him who puffed)&mdash;all the din and hallooing above, just as well as
if we had been on deck. Somebody kept swearing at somebody else, which
somebody else seemed to take in very bad part, as I heard him say,
"I arn't a going to put up with no gammon from a feller like you, as
doesn't know an umbreller from a spring ini'n."</p>

<p class="indent">I didn't exactly believe that there could be anybody in
these march-of-intellect days, incapable of distinguishing an umbrella from
a spring onion, and therefore I felt this to be most unjustifiable
abuse, whomsoever it was addressed to; but it was no business of mine,
and I didn't care how much they abused each other, if they had only
done it in a lower tone of voice, so as not to disturb me.</p>

<p class="indent">When the "tumult dwindled to a calm," a splash and a hiss,
accompanied by the moving of the vessel, gave me intelligence that we were
"off." As we dropped down the river, memory recalled the peaceful
recreation of dining at Blackwall on white-bait; while certain matters
which occurred at a Greenwich fair, stared me accusingly in the face.</p>

<p class="indent">Amid these reflections I fell into an uneasy slumber, which
lasted till six, broken at intervals by various thumps on the deck, which
seemed directed immediately at my head below. In the morning
"the pie was opened, and the birds began to sing;" that is to say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
my companions began to draw their dingy little curtains back, and
gradually to unfold themselves. I found we consisted of fourteen
souls and bodies,&mdash;ten Germans, and four of the same free and
enlightened nation of which I have the honour to be a component part.</p>

<p class="indent">We chatted till about seven; and then one got up, and another
got up, and, lastly, I myself got up and dressed; not, however, without a
feeling that I had better have left well alone. When I got up on
deck, I asked a sailor, "How's the wind?"&mdash;"Dead agin yer," was
the satisfactory reply. I wasn't surprised.</p>

<p class="indent">While I dressed, I paid due attention to a request posted
up over the washing-stands, "That gentlemen should refrain from throwing
their shaving-paper into their basins, as it stopped up the pipes, and
<i>increased</i> the smell of the cabins." This of itself seemed a tacit
acknowledgement of the existence of a very agreeable concomitant to
our comforts,&mdash;as you can hardly <i>increase</i> a thing which did not
previously exist; indeed there was no doubt about that, without any
notice.</p>

<p class="indent">When we had all got up stairs by different instalments, after
pacing the decks a little, we received a summons to breakfast. I endeavoured
to sham an appetite, but it was no go; so I ate sparingly, being
most distrustful of the future.</p>

<p class="indent">"Waiter!" cried one of the English,&mdash;a short, stout gentleman,
in a dressing-gown,&mdash;"bring up the parcel in front of my berth."</p>

<p class="indent">"Sart'nly, sir!" replied the smart handman.</p>

<p class="indent">Up came the parcel; and, as I had heard the demand, I had
the curiosity to see what came of it. The parcel turned out to be a nice
brown-bread loaf, off which the owner cut a small slice, and carefully
put it on a plate by his side. His neighbour on the other side then
began talking to him, which diverted his attention from the loaf.
His other neighbour, who had not seen where it came from, wanting
some bread, and finding it at his elbow, helped himself; and a man,
a little lower down, said,</p>

<p class="indent">"May I trouble you for the bread?"</p>

<p class="indent">"With pleasure, sir;" and another slice went, and so on,
till the last remnant came round to the man who sat opposite the rightful
owner, who was talking away still, with his friend, as if they had been
settling the tithe question. He took the bit left, and began devouring
it; and a pause having taken place in the conversation opposite,
he said to the loaf-proprietor,</p>

<p class="indent">"For myself, I like brown bread just as well as white;
what do you say?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, <i>I</i> prefer it; and, not knowing that we should get
it on board, I took the precaution of bringing a loaf with me, big enough to
last me all the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">As he spoke, he turned to illustrate his remark by showing
the size of his loaf, when, to his dismay, he found nothing but the empty
plate. I never shall forget his face. He first of all turned to the
man who had addressed him, and into whose capacious mouth the last
morsel was vanishing:</p>

<p class="indent">"Confound it, sir! that's my bread you're eating!"</p>

<p class="indent">Then to his next neighbour on his right:</p>

<p class="indent">"Was it you who took my loaf, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Your loaf, sir? Who are you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir! I repeat, my loaf; my brown loaf."</p>

<p class="indent">"I certainly took a loaf, sir, and a brown loaf, which stood
next to me; but whether it was yours or not I can't say; and I believe everybody
else took it too!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, then it's gone!" It was.</p>

<p class="indent">Breakfast being over, we had but little to do, and nothing
to divert our thoughts from our mournful position. I went fidgeting about,
asking how the weather was. The answers were delightful. The
wind was so violent and adverse that the captain thought it useless
to go out to sea, and therefore intended to "bring up"&mdash;ominous
term!&mdash;in Owesly Bay, near Harwich. The rain drove me into the
"splendid saloon," which I would have bartered for a cellar in Fetterlane;
and, after half an hour's doubt and wonder whether I was going
round the world, or the world round me, I felt it not only prudent,
but necessary, to seek greater privacy; and, after much sorrow and
tempest of spirit, I got into my comfortable bed.</p>

<p class="indent">The captain was as good, or rather as bad, as his word.
He "brought up" in Owesly Bay, and I will say no more than that the
force of example was astonishing. How long we waited about in that
sad bay, I cannot exactly say, as I had become insensible to the nice
distinction between tossing up and down, and pitching and rolling at
anchor, or going on. It was enough, and too much for me, that we
<i>did</i> toss up and down, and pitch and roll.</p>

<p class="indent">So ended Wednesday the 14th. We were intended to arrive
at Hamburg at two o'clock on Friday morning; but the adverse wind,
and bringing up, seemed to throw a doubt over this.</p>

<p class="indent">Still it was not impossible, if the wind abated. Thursday
morning was ushered in by numerous inquiries as to where we were. We
were more than gratified by being told "Much where we were last
night." This was told to me, who felt that I had signed a lease for
my life, extending only to Friday, at two <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, as
the longest possible time I could hold out; and that after that time the lease
would be up, and I should be ejected from my mortal tenement.</p>

<p class="indent">The Germans who were on board ate and drank heartily,
and wanted me to get up and shave. I thought that the chance of being
drowned was enough, without the certainty of cutting my throat from
ear to ear, which I should inevitably have done if I had attempted to
use a razor in the state of the vessel's movements. They endeavoured
to get me up, by touching my national pride.</p>

<p class="indent">"What! an Englishman afraid?" said they.</p>

<p class="indent">"No," answered I; "but very sick."</p>

<p class="indent">Thursday heard many groans, and, if it had eyes, might
have seen many strange sights.</p>

<p class="indent">Friday morning, two <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;the promised
period of our arrival at the haven of our hopes&mdash;found us still wide at sea; and it
was not till Friday evening that we heard the news that we were off the mouth of
the Texel, one hundred miles from the Elbe, which was our destination.
We were then in that sort of reckless state that we regarded
distance as nothing,&mdash;one hundred miles seemed to me, much
the same as one thousand; and I opened and shut my mouth in the
agonies of despair, and something worse.</p>

<p class="indent">All this time I had continued in bed, eating what they brought
me, not from any relish or appetite, but on the principle that if you are in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
a den with a roaring lion, and have a leg of mutton to give him, it is
prudent to do so; and there was in my den with me an intolerant
and savage spirit, which treated me exceedingly ill when I gave
it nothing to wreak its fury upon, and showed but little gratitude
when I did, either declining the proffered gifts, or only receiving
them to render me more dejected by a speedy and contemptuous return.</p>

<p class="indent">Saturday morning early, we heard, with as much joy, and
with as much interest as we could feel in anything, that we should soon be
in the Elbe, and in tolerably smooth water. What ideas these sailors have
of smooth water! I wonder if they ever look in a washing-basin?</p>

<p class="indent">As I lay waiting for the smooth water, I could not help
anathematising those deceitful vagabonds, the poets, who write very pretty
and pleasing lines about a tender affair they call a zephyr, and describe it
as "softly sighing on a summer's eve," "lightly dancing on the moonlit
lake," "mildly breaking over the bending corn," and a variety of
agreeable and amiable habits. But these worthy gentlemen, who
write in a comfortable arm-chair, little know the change which takes
place in their sighing friend when a dozen or two of them club together
to make a gale of wind for an afternoon's amusement. I wish I
had had a score of these same poets on board,&mdash;the world would never
have heard anything from them again about "bending corn!" A
zephyr bears about the some proportion to a gale of wind as a Vauxhall
slice of ham does to the "whole hog." However, all evils have
an end, and ours began to conclude a little; for certainly I seemed to
get a little better, and was well enough when we passed Heligoland&mdash;which
is an island in the possession of his most gracious majesty,
whom Heaven long preserve!&mdash;to sing lustily, and like a true Briton as I am,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Send him victorious,</span>
<span class="i0">Happy and glorious,</span>
<span class="i0">Long to reign over us,</span>
<span class="i0">God save the king!"</span>
</div></div>

<p>I then dressed myself, the water being still too rough to allow
me to do anything but cut my throat with my razor; and went on deck,
where I soon afterwards enjoyed the sight of green fields, and
the villas which ornament the banks of the Elbe, with a most satisfactory
view of Hamburg at no great distance.</p>

<p class="indent">And, now that I have brought myself to dry land, do I
make a vow never again to make a long sea-voyage,&mdash;always excepting
"leaving my country for my country's good," which may happen;
but the Britannia, if she chooses "to rule the waves," never shall
have me as an accomplice again, though</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2>STRAY CHAPTERS.</h2>
<p class="f90">BY BOZ.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p class="f110 space-below1"><b>SOME PARTICULARS CONCERNING A LION.</b></p>

<p class="indent">We have a great respect for lions in the abstract.
In common with most other people, we have heard and read of many
instances of their bravery and generosity. We have duly admired
that heroic self-denial and charming philanthropy, which
prompts them never to eat people except when they are hungry,
and we have been deeply impressed with a becoming sense of
the politeness they are said to display towards unmarried ladies
of a certain state. All natural histories teem with anecdotes
illustrative of their excellent qualities; and one old spelling-book
in particular recounts a touching instance of an old lion of
high moral dignity and stern principle, who felt it his imperative
duty to devour a young man who had contracted a habit of
swearing, as a striking example to the rising generation.</p>

<p class="indent">All this is extremely pleasant to reflect upon, and
 indeed says a very great deal in favour of lions as a mass. We are bound
to state, however, that such individual lions as we have happened
to fall in with, have not put forth any very striking characteristics,
and have not acted up to the chivalrous character
assigned them by their chroniclers. We never saw a lion in
what is called his natural state, certainly; that is to say, we
have never met a lion out walking in a forest, or crouching in
his lair under a tropical sun waiting till his dinner should happen
to come by, hot from the baker's. But we have seen some
under the influence of captivity and the pressure of misfortune;
and we must say that they appeared to us very apathetic,
heavy-headed fellows.</p>

<p class="indent">The lion at the Zoological Gardens, for instance.
He is all very well; he has an undeniable mane, and looks very fierce;
but, Lord bless us! what of that? The lions of the fashionable
world look just as ferocious, and are the most harmless creatures
breathing. A box-lobby lion or a Regent-street animal
will put on a most terrible aspect, and roar fearfully, if you
affront him; but he will never bite, and, if you offer to attack
him manfully, will fairly turn tail and sneak off. Doubtless
these creatures roam about sometimes in herds, and, if they
meet any especially meek-looking and peaceably-disposed fellow,
will endeavour to frighten him; but the faintest show of a
vigorous resistance is sufficient to scare them even then. These
are pleasant characteristics, whereas we make it matter of distinct
charge against the Zoological lion and his brethren at the
fairs, that they are sleepy, dreamy, sluggish quadrupeds.</p>

<p class="indent">We do not remember to have ever seen one of them
perfectly awake, except at feeding-time. In every respect we uphold the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
biped lions against their four-footed namesakes, and we boldly
challenge controversy upon the subject.</p>

<p class="indent">With these opinions it may be easily imagined that
our curiosity and interest were very much excited the other day, when
a lady of our acquaintance called on us and resolutely declined
to accept our refusal of her invitation to an evening party;
"for," said she, "I have got a lion coming." We at once retracted
our plea of a prior engagement, and became as anxious
to go, as we had previously been to stay away.</p>

<p class="indent">We went early and posted ourself in an eligible part
of the drawing-room, from whence we could hope to obtain a full view
of the interesting animal. Two or three hours passed, the quadrilles
began, the room filled; but no lion appeared. The lady
of the house became inconsolable,&mdash;for it is one of the peculiar
privileges of these lions to make solemn appointments and never
keep them,&mdash;when all of a sudden there came a tremendous
double rap at the street-door, and the master of the house, after
gliding out (unobserved as he flattered himself) to peep over
the banisters, came into the room, rubbing his hands together
with great glee, and cried out in a very important voice, "My
dear, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (naming the lion) has this moment arrived."</p>

<p class="indent">Upon this, all eyes were turned towards the door, and
we observed several young ladies, who had been laughing and conversing
previously with great gaiety and good-humour, grow
extremely quiet and sentimental; while some young gentlemen,
who had been cutting great figures in the facetious and smalltalk
way, suddenly sank very obviously in the estimation of the
company, and were looked upon with great coldness and indifference.
Even the young man who had been ordered from the
music-shop to play the pianoforte, was visibly affected, and
struck several false notes in the excess of his excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">All this time there was a great talking outside,
more than once accompanied by a loud laugh, and a cry of "Oh, capital!
excellent!" from which we inferred that the lion was jocose, and
that these exclamations were occasioned by the transports of his
keeper and our host. Nor were we deceived; for when the lion
at last appeared, we overheard his keeper, who was a little prim
man, whisper to several gentlemen of his acquaintance, with
uplifted hands and every expression of half-suppressed admiration,
that &mdash;&mdash; (naming the lion again) was in <i>such</i> cue to-night!</p>

<p class="indent">The lion was a literary one: of course there were
a vast number of people present, who had admired his roarings, and
were anxious to be introduced to him; and very pleasant it was
to see them brought up for the purpose, and to observe the
patient dignity with which he received all their patting and
caressing. This brought forcibly to our mind what we had so
often witnessed at country fairs, where the other lions are compelled
to go through as many forms of courtesy as they chance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
to be acquainted with, just as often as admiring parties happen
to drop in upon them.</p>

<p class="indent">While the lion was exhibiting in this way, his keeper
was not idle, for he mingled among the crowd, and spread his praises
most industriously. To one gentleman he whispered some very
choice thing that the noble animal had said in the very act of
coming up stairs, which, of course, rendered the mental effort
still more astonishing; to another he murmured a hasty account
of a grand dinner that had taken place the day before, where
twenty-seven gentlemen had got up all at once to demand an
extra cheer for the lion; and to the ladies he made sundry promises
of interceding to procure the majestic brute's sign-manual
for their albums. Then, there were little private consultations
in different corners, relative to the personal appearance and stature
of the lion; whether he was shorter than they had expected
to see him, or taller, or thinner, or fatter, or younger, or older;
whether he was like his portrait or unlike it; and whether the
particular shade of his eyes was black, or blue, or hazel, or
green, or yellow, or mixture. At all these consultations the
keeper assisted; and, in short, the lion was the sole and single
subject of discussion till they sat him down to whist, and then
the people relapsed into their old topics of
conversation&mdash;themselves and each other.</p>

<p class="indent">We must confess that we looked forward with no
slight impatience to the announcement of supper; for if you wish to see
a tame lion under particularly favourable circumstances, feeding-time
is the period of all others to pitch upon. We were therefore
very much delighted to observe a sensation among the
guests, which we well knew how to interpret, and immediately
afterwards to behold the lion escorting the lady of the house
down stairs. We offered our arm to an elderly female of our
acquaintance, who&mdash;dear old soul!&mdash;is the very best person
that ever lived, to lead down to any meal; for, be the room ever so
small or the party ever so large, she is sure, by some intuitive
perception of the eligible, to push and pull herself and conductor
close to the best dishes on the table;&mdash;we say we offered
our arm to this elderly female, and, descending the stairs shortly
after the lion, were fortunate enough to obtain a seat nearly opposite
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course the keeper was there already. He had planted
himself at precisely that distance from his charge which afforded
him a decent pretext for raising his voice, when he addressed
him, to so loud a key as could not fail to attract the attention of
the whole company, and immediately began to apply himself
seriously to the task of bringing the lion out, and putting him
through the whole of his man&oelig;vres. Such flashes of wit as he
elicited from the lion! First of all they began to make puns
upon a salt-cellar, and then upon the breast of a fowl, and then
upon the trifle; but the best jokes of all were decidedly on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
lobster-salad, upon which latter subject the lion came out most
vigorously, and, in the opinion of the most competent authorities,
quite outshone himself. This is a very excellent mode
of shining in society, and is founded, we humbly conceive,
upon the classic model of the dialogues between Mr. Punch and
his friend the proprietor, wherein the latter takes all the up-hill
work, and is content to pioneer to the jokes and repartees of
Mr. P. himself, who never fails to gain great credit and excite
much laughter thereby. Whatever it be founded on, however,
we recommend it to all lions, present and to come; for in this
instance it succeeded to admiration, and perfectly dazzled the
whole body of hearers.</p>

<p class="indent">When the salt-cellar, and the fowl's breast, and the trifle,
and the lobster-salad were all exhausted, and could not afford standing-room
for another solitary witticism, the keeper performed
that very dangerous feat which is still done with some of the
caravan lions, although in one instance it terminated fatally, of
putting his head in the animal's mouth, and placing himself
entirely at its mercy. Boswell frequently presents a melancholy
instance of the lamentable results of this achievement, and other
keepers and jackals have been terribly lacerated for their
daring. It is due to our lion to state, that he condescended to
be trifled with, in the most gentle manner, and finally went home
with the showman in a hack cab: perfectly peaceable, but
slightly fuddled.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Being in a contemplative mood, we were led to
make some reflections upon the character and conduct of this genus of lions
as we walked homewards, and we were not long in arriving at the
conclusion that our former impression in their favour was very
much strengthened and confirmed by what we had recently seen.
While the other lions receive company and compliments in a
sullen, moody, not to say snarling manner, these appear flattered
by the attentions that are paid them; while those conceal
themselves to the utmost of their power from the vulgar gaze,
these court the popular eye, and, unlike their brethren, whom
nothing short of compulsion will move to exertion, are ever
ready to display their acquirements to the wondering throng.
We have known bears of undoubted ability who, when the
expectations of a large audience have been wound up to the utmost
pitch, have peremptorily refused to dance; well-taught
monkeys, who have unaccountably objected to exhibit on the
slack-wire; and elephants of unquestioned genius, who have
suddenly declined to turn the barrel-organ: but we never once
knew or heard of a biped lion, literary or otherwise,&mdash;and we
state it as a fact which is highly creditable to the whole species,&mdash;who,
occasion offering, did not seize with avidity on any opportunity
which was afforded him, of performing to his heart's
content on the first violin.

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE LEGEND OF BOHIS HEAD.</h2>

<p class="indent">One of the most south-western points of Ireland is the
promontory of Bohis, which forms the northern shore of the bay of Balinskeligs.
A singular conformation of rock is observable upon the extremity of
the wild cape, it being worn by the incessant beating of the billows
into a grotesque resemblance of the human profile. The waves, however,
are not suffered to claim undisputed this rude sculpture as their
own; a far different origin being attributed to it by the legends of the
country around. The following is the legend, as told to us.</p>

<p class="indent">In times long, very long ago,&mdash;prior even to that early
age when Milesius came over from Spain, to plant in Ireland the prolific tribes
of the <i>O</i>'s and the <i>Mac</i>'s,&mdash;Bohis Head, instead of the abrupt,
broken cliffs that now terminate it, presented a lofty and uniform wall of
rock to the assaults of the Atlantic. Upon the topmost summit
(much about where now stand the unfinished walls of one of those
desirable winter-residences, the coast watch-towers, built at <i>the
end</i> of the last war,) there stood, at the period of our tale, the
castle of a very celebrated personage, generally known in those parts
as the Baon Ri Dhuv,&mdash;in plain English, "The Black Lady,"&mdash;a title
partly bestowed on her, on account of her dark hair and face, and
partly on account of the cruelty and tyranny which she exercised
upon all those who were subject to her dominion. She must have been
redoubtable in no small degree, as, besides the possession of a large
army, which she could at any time collect from her numerous array
of vassals, she was a deep proficient in the art of magic, and was
even said to have once, by the potency of her spells, prevented a
drop of rain from falling upon her territories (which included the
whole of Munster) for a week together. But as the south of Ireland
at least has never since been known to be so long without showers,
this feat is not so implicitly believed as other of the traditions
about her. However that may be, this at least is certain, that she
wanted for nothing that force or fraud, fair means or means the
most unholy, could give her; and she was deemed the happiest as
well as the most powerful being in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Those who said this, did not judge truly. In the midst of
all her splendour and state, caressed, feared, flattered, obeyed as she was
by all, she was not happy; and it is strange that her tenants and servants
did not find this out, as her usual method of easing her feelings
was by ill-treating and abusing them. But they were, in all probability,
too much afraid of her to call even their thoughts their own, for
fear of being metamorphosed into goats, or cows, or some other species
of beasts; a change of life which, from the scanty grazing of the
neighbouring mountain pastures, they did not deem very inviting.
She was <i>not</i> happy; and simply because, among her myriad of vassals,
flatterers, and slaves, she had not one <i>friend</i>. There was the
whole secret. In her inmost soul she&mdash;that proud, tyrannical, haughty,
hard-hearted woman&mdash;felt that, all feared and all potent as she was,
she still was no more than mortal; and that within her own breast
there was that which tyrannised over herself,&mdash;the innate longings of
our nature for sympathy, for companionship, for affection. The humblest
hind that served her, had a comrade,&mdash;a friend; while she, the
queen and mistress of all, was the object of detestation as universal
as the slavish obedience that met her at every step. At first she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
scoffed and spurned at the dull internal aching; it was a weakness,
she thought, that needed but to be fought against, to be for ever
quelled. She sought wars and conflicts; she dived deeper than ever
before into the unholy mysteries of the "Black Art;" she revelled,
she feasted, and she succeeded in quelling the rebel feeling for a
time,&mdash;but only for a time. There came a reaction to her excitement;
and, while her spirits and all else seemed exhausted and worn
out, this dull yearning was stronger and more aching than ever. At
length, one day, after a long and painful reverie, she started up, striking
her forehead violently, and vowed that she would have a friend,&mdash;a
companion,&mdash;nay, even (as her sentimentality increased with indulgence)
a <i>husband</i>,&mdash;or perish in the attempt! As the oath passed
her lips, a tremendous peal of thunder rolled over the castle towers
and passed off to seaward, dying away in the distance with a sound
not unlike a wild and prolonged shout of laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">She had not much time to lose, if she intended to marry.
The little servant-boy, who had been allowed to get drunk on the night
of rejoicings for her birth, was now a grave and sedate major-domo
of most venerable age. She herself, but some fifteen or sixteen
years his junior, was long past the time when the grossest flattery
could make her believe that she was young; and her years had not
passed over her head without leaving their traces behind. She had
been in her best days what is called by friends "rather plain," which
generally means "very ugly." Her forehead bowed out and overhung
her nose, which endeavoured to stretch out to some decent
length, but was unfortunately foiled by the want of a bridge. The
mouth, as if it perceived this failure on the part of the feature immediately
above it, modestly declined the contest, and retreated far inward.
The chin, however, amply made up for all intermediate deficiencies,
and even surpassed the forehead in the hugeness of its proportions,
or <i>dis</i>proportions. Her hair was black, as has been said,
and hung in long, lanky clusters about her face. Time seldom improves
the human countenance, and certainly made no exception in
favour of the Baon Ri Dhuv. At the time of her vow many wrinkles
had made their appearance, and unequivocal grey hairs chequered the
once uniform sable that covered her head. Magic had not then arrived
at the pitch of perfection to which it afterwards attained in the
times of Virgilius and Apollonius Rhodius; and, among the inventions
yet in the womb of time, were the charms for restoring youth
and imparting beauty.</p>

<p class="indent">The lady of the castle set off, one fine morning, on the
back of a cloud which she had hailed as it was drifting over her chimney-tops,
driven inland by the fresh breeze from the ocean. As she was borne
along, she looked anxiously right and left down upon the earth, to
spy out, if possible, the desired companion. But she found she had
grown very fastidious, now that the means of ridding herself of her
troublesome desires appeared open to her. She looked at no women;
she felt instinctively that none of her own sex could be the friend
that would satisfy her heart: but all the young men that she passed
over, she scrutinized, as if her life depended upon it. They in their
turn stared a good deal at her, as well they might; for it was no
common thing, even in those days, to see a woman perched up on a
cloud, sailing over your head before a rattling breeze of wind. Perhaps
it was their staring at her, so different from the downcast eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
and humble mien of her slaves at home,&mdash;perhaps it was their rude
remarks that displeased her; whatever it was, on she went without
making her choice, until towards the close of the day she found she
had nearly crossed Ireland in a diagonal line from south-west to
north-east, the wind blowing in that direction. As it still blew merrily,
and it was full-moon night, she determined to go on to Scotland, and
try whether Sawnie could please her, better then Paddy. With this
resolve she had not proceeded more than half a league from the shore
of Ireland, when she perceived she was going over a mountain-islet
some five or six miles in girth, and apparently very fertile in its soil,
for large herds of cattle were grazing upon its sides. It is a trite and
true saying, that those who possess much, are often covetous of more;
and in her case it was especially true. With a word she stayed the
cloud over the island; the wind falling all at once, in obedience to her
will. If there were any of the old Vikingir, those daring privateersmen
of ancient times, that night upon the waters, how they and their
fierce crews must have heaped maledictions on the unseen power that
quelled the merry breeze before which they were late careering gaily
with bended mast and bellying sail, and summoned them to ply the
labouring oar throughout the hours they had vainly hoped to give to
slumber! But the Black Lady was not a person to care much for
such trifles as curses. If she had been so, she would have led an
extremely uncomfortable life, for she had merited a good many of
them in her time. Over the island she hung, gazing down upon it,
and gloating on its richness and fertility, while she inwardly resolved
to strain her magical powers to the utmost, to transfer it from
its present position to the neighbourhood of her own coast. Her
attention, however, was soon withdrawn from all other objects, and
concentrated on one that had just caught her eye: it was a young
man, the only one she had as yet seen who did not stare up at her,
rudely and impertinently. Indeed he did not look up at all. He
seemed to have no eyes, no soul, for any one but a young girl who
was by his side. The lady on the cloud could see by the moonlight
that the girl's face was exceedingly beautiful; that is to say, as much
as could be perceived of it when she occasionally, and but for a moment,
raised her eyes from the ground, on which they were riveted.</p>

<p class="indent">"Speak! will you not speak to me?" were the words
of the young man: "but one word, Eva,&mdash;dearest Eva,&mdash;to tell
me have I offended by my boldness?"</p>

<p class="indent">The girl blushed ten times deeper than before, and her
lips quivered as at length she slowly murmured out, "No, Conla!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Thanks! thanks!" was his rapturous exclamation;
"a thousand times thanks, my own, my ... Hallo! what is this? Whence
come you?" These latter words were addressed to the Black Lady, as, to
his utter astonishment, she alighted from the cloud right in his path.
Eva shrieked, and hid her face in his bosom.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am the Baon Ri Dhuv," said the enchantress, trying to
look dignified, and to smooth away the scowl that had darkened her visage
since she perceived his companion,&mdash;"the Queen of the South!"</p>

<p class="indent">"And what can the Baon Ri Dhuv, the Queen of the South,
want with Conla, a shepherd of the north?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Young man, mock me not," replied she, frowning most awfully:
"you know not, but you may be made to <i>feel</i>, my power. Listen to
me," continued she in a milder tone, and putting on what she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
intended to be a most amiable and engaging look; but which gave her
coarse lineaments a still more grotesque hideousness, that almost
made the young shepherd laugh in her face, despite the secret
dread he felt creeping on his heart. "I am the ruler of a vast tract
of country; I have a vast army to do my will; nay, more, I have dominion
over the elements in their fiercest rage, and spirits obey my
bidding. I am rich beyond counting. You smile, and believe not.
Look here!"</p>

<p class="indent">As she spoke, she struck the ground three times with her
foot, muttering rapidly to herself, when up sprang close to her, a tall tree
of the purest gold, the glittering branches laden with jewels beyond
all price. Seizing one of these, a magnificent emerald, and pulling
it off the branch, again she stamped her foot, and the tree disappeared,
leaving the jewel in her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">"Here," continued she, putting it into Conla's passive
hand, "here is earnest of my wealth; leave that weak girl, and come with
me to wealth and happiness!"</p>

<p class="indent">Conla had hitherto been kept dumb by the strange scene
before him; but now, rousing himself, he looked at his Eva, and meeting
her gaze of deep, whole-hearted, confiding affection, he dashed the
glittering jewel on the ground, and cried,</p>

<p class="indent">"Away, sorceress! I spurn your gifts, your accursed
power, yourself! With Eva will I live or die!"</p>

<p class="indent">The face of the Black Lady showed horrible in the pale moonlight,
as, with a withering scowl of hatred and vengeance, she again spoke:</p>

<p class="indent">"You shall not die, insolent wretch! You shall live in agonies
to which death were mercy; ay, and she, too,&mdash;that worthless thing you
prefer to me,&mdash;she, too, shall suffer!"</p>

<p class="indent">As she spoke, she described a circle in the air with her
hand round the island. At once the moon became obscured, and a terrible
darkness fell upon all, while a sudden storm swept over the island. Conla
and his Eva tried to fly to some cave for refuge, but were arrested by
the sight that met their eyes when the transitory darkness cleared
away. The moon again shone out brilliantly, and by its light the
lovers perceived, to their great horror, that the island itself was in
motion! A little ahead of its southernmost point their persecutor
was scudding over the waters in a bark, the traditional accounts of
which, represent it as a good deal resembling the steam-boats of
modern days, for there was smoke issuing out of it; and two or three
respectable individuals, with black faces, fiery eyes, horns on their
heads, and tails twirled in graceful folds, might be seen through an
open hatchway, employed in much the same manner as the hard-working,
hard-drinking steam-packet engineers of our own times, while a
clacking and clanging of iron was continually heard, similar to the
sounds that annoy sea-sick passengers at present. From the taffrail of
this inviting-looking vessel, three or four strong cables stretched to
the island, and were rove through an immense hole in a huge projecting
rock, that seemed as if it had been bored for this especial purpose.
The steamer tugged gallantly, and the island plashed and splashed
heavily along, at the rate of twenty or thirty knots an hour: the cows
and sheep upon the latter, not having their sea-legs aboard, tumbled
and rolled about in fine style. Eva got exceedingly sea-sick, and Conla
exceedingly indignant: but there was no use in his anger. On the island went.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">On and on,&mdash;past Belfast, Drogheda, Dublin,&mdash;rattling
and splashing along, greatly to the astonishment of the fishes, who, besides
being then quite unaccustomed to public steaming, had never before
seen an island on the move. Between Dublin and Holyhead there
was a little difficulty; for the island, which was exceedingly
unmanageable, fetched away to starboard, and took the ground a little
outside of Howth. This was a cause of great delight to the lovers,
who thought their voyage was now at an end; but they were much
mistaken; two of the amiable gentry who manned the tug-boat
jumped lightly on the island, and cut away with a couple of strokes
of an axe the part that was aground, it breaking into two pieces,
which remain to this day, proof of the truth of this tale, under the
names of Lambay and Ireland's Eye. On went the steamer again,
and on went the island merrily and clumsily as ever, and the Black
Lady looked back and laughed at the disappointed lovers.</p>

<p class="indent">Wicklow went by,&mdash;Wexford,&mdash;and now the shores of
the county Waterford hove in sight; and the vessel and island, rounding Point
Carnsore in gallant style, issued out from the Irish Channel into the
waters of the Atlantic.</p>

<p class="indent">Morning had broken by this time, and a bright and
beautiful morning it was. Eva, overpowered by fatigue, had sunk to sleep;
Conla sate beside her, deep anxiety lowering on his brow, and his soul rent
with the most agonizing emotions. Meantime his body was just as
much disturbed, for the island was now heaving and pitching worse
than before, upon the longer billows of the ocean; and he occasionally
had to hold on with both his hands to the stones and shrubs near
him, to prevent himself from being what sailors would call "hove
overboard" by the violent motion of the strange craft in, or rather
<i>on</i>, which he was embarked. Disliking his situation exceedingly,
and greatly fearing that he would have still more reason to do so, he
saw that there was no chance of his delivery from it, if he could not
succeed in mollifying the enraged enchantress. Espying her again
seated upon the steamer's taffrail, he therefore hailed her, and sought
by humble prayers and entreaties to induce her to release him and
his Eva; or, if one should suffer, to set her free, and vent the heaviest
vengeance upon his head. But the Black Lady let him talk on. He
had a very sweet voice, and she liked to hear that; and, when he
had done, she contented herself with simply shaking her head in
token of refusal: then, as he again stooped his proud spirit to still
more vehement entreaties and supplications, and raved in the intensity
of his anguish, she mocked at him, and laughed loud and long in
scorn, till at length, wearied out and despairing, he sunk his head
upon his bosom, and was silent. Slowly the day wore on, but quickly
the headlands and bays of the southern shore of Ireland glided by;
and great was the wonder and amaze of those who looked to seaward
from that shore. Many were the noble fishes left that day in the
depths of the ocean with the barbed hook fast in their jaws, as the
wild natives of the coast, in terror at the sight of the demon vessel
and her charge, hove overboard their rude fishing-gear to lighten
their frail coracles, and plied sail and oar to seek refuge on the land.
It has been even surmised that it was some such sight as this, that
scared that first great geographer, Ptolemy, and made him fly the
Irish coast ere he had completed his survey. However, this is a
point that has never been fully ascertained.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The sun was sinking gloriously into the bosom of the
slow-heaving main as the steamer, with the island in tow, rounded Dursey Head,
and hove in sight of their destination, the promontory of Bohis.
With exultation in her eyes, the Baon Ri Dhuv pointed out her lofty
castle, shining in the distance with the last rays of the departing orb
of day. Eva was now awake, and her and Conla's supplications
were poured out for mercy and for pity; but they might as well
have been uttered to Bohis Head itself. The leagues between the
latter place and Dursey Head were rapidly traversed, and now the
island had been towed within a mile of its final destination, which
was the promontory on which the castle stood. At this moment
another sudden storm, such as that of the preceding night, passed
athwart the scene; and, when it cleared away, the steamer had
disappeared, and the Black Lady was to be seen, upon the headland
tugging at the island to bring it closer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is there no help in Heaven!" cried Conla, as, after another appeal
in vain to their persecutor, he threw his eyes up with a reproachful glance.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hush, Conla! reproach not the powers above; they are most
merciful, and will protect us. Hark! they answer!"</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment a heavy peal of thunder crashed over head, and,
rolling towards the castle, seemed to expend itself over its summit.</p>

<p class="indent">"Dread lady," cried Eva, animated to unusual courage by the
omen, "hearken to that, and yield to the powers of Heaven!&mdash;they
declare against thy tyranny!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Never!" roared the tyrant, her eyes flashing baleful fire.
"Sooner will I become part of this mountain on which I stand mistress, than
ye shall escape me!"</p>

<p class="indent">As she spoke, she gave a pull with her utmost strength
to the chains. At the moment a vivid flash of lightning darted from the
clouds, and the chains snapped right asunder. With the force of the
shock the Black Lady was precipitated into the sea, the island at the
same time rebounding back and becoming fixed for ever about halfway
between Dursey and Bohis Head.</p>

<p class="indent">The Baon Ri Dhuv's tenants and servants spent the night
in vainly searching for her. The morning revealed to them a terrible sight.
Upon the extremity of the cape her well-known visage appeared, but
transformed to stone, and doomed for ages to remain there, lashed
by the raging billows of the ocean. Thus was her fatal wish accomplished!</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The island so strangely brought round, remains where
it recoiled to, and is now known by the name of Scariff. It is still rich land,
and feeds many herds; a strong proof of the authenticity of this tale,
and which is farther borne out by the fact, that the hole through
which the towing-chains were rove remains to this hour. Conla and
Eva lived happily for the rest of their days where they were, and left
a numerous progeny. It is said that the little old man who, with his
strapping offspring, fourteen in number, now tenants the island, is
their lineal descendant. The emerald that Conla threw away was
afterwards found, and preserved as a memorial of the events narrated
until the times of Cromwell; when some of his soldiers, having visited
the island for the laudable purpose of killing a friar who lived there
as a hermit, indulged another of their virtuous propensities by carrying
the jewel away with them.

<p class="indent space-above1">The first is a glee in praise of poverty, a subject on which poets of
every country have a common understanding. The Italian <span class="smcap">Berni</span>,
indeed, went a step farther when he sang the "comforts of being in
debt,"&mdash;<i>La laude del debito</i>; but your enthusiast never knows where
to stop. This MS. may suit in the present state of the money market,&mdash;a
bill drawn by Burns and endorsed by Beranger. You can rely
on the Scotchman's signature, <i>experto crede Roberto</i>; while there
can be no doubt that the French songster's financial condition fully
entitles him to join Burns in an attempt of this kind. Since, however,
much spurious paper appears to be afloat, you will use your

<p class="center space-above1"><b><span class="smcap">Scrap</span> No. VI.</b></p>
<p class="indent">Possevino, in his <i>History of the Gonzagas</i>,
(fol. Mantua, 1620,) tells us, at page 781, that a Polish army, having penetrated
to the Euxine, found the ashes, with many MSS. of Ovid under a marble monument,
which they transferred in pomp to Cracow, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1581.
It is well known that the exiled Roman had written sundry poems in barbaric
metre to gratify the Scythian and Getic literati with whom he was
surrounded. We have his own words for it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">"<i>C&aelig;pique poet&aelig;</i></span>
<span class="i10"><i>Inter inhumanos nomen habere Getas.</i>"</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The following is a fair specimen, procured by the kindness of
the late erudite Quaff-y-punchovitz, Keeper of the Archives of the Cracovian
University. The rhythmic termination, called by the Greeks
 <b>&omicron;&mu;&omicron;&iota;&omicron;&tau;&epsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&nu;&tau;&omicron;&nu;</b>
is here clearly traceable to a Northern origin. It would appear
that the Scandinavian poets took great pride in the nicety and richness
of these rhymes, by which they beguiled the tediousness of their
winter nights:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"<i>Accipiunt inimicam hyemem</i> <span class="smcap">RIMIS</span><i>que,
                            fatiscunt.</i>"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent space-below1">Ovid first tried thus an experiment on his native tongue, which
was duly followed up by the <span class="smcap">Church</span>, not unwilling to indulge by
any reasonable concession her barbarous converts in the sixth century.
Of Mr. Lover's translation it were superfluous to point out the miraculous
fidelity; delicate gallantry and well-sustained humour distinguish
every line of his vernacular version, hardly to be surpassed
by the <i>Ars amandi</i> of his Latin competitor.</p>

<span class="i4">When the monks he saw,</span>

<span class="i0">"Pray, be so good as to walk this way!"</span>
<span class="i4">Slower and slower</span>
<span class="i4">He limp'd on before,</span>
<span class="i0">Till they came to the back of the belfry-door,</span>

<span class="i4">He hopped now about</span>

<span class="i0">At Matins, at Vespers, he never was out;</span>

<span class="i0">He always seem'd telling the Confessor's beads.</span>
<span class="i0">If any one lied, or if any one swore,</span>
<span class="i0">Or slumber'd in pray'r time and happened to snore,</span>
<span class="i4">That good Jackdaw</span>
<span class="i4">Would give a great "caw,"</span>
<span class="i0">As much as to say, "Don't do so any more!"</span>
<span class="i0">While many remarked, as his manner they saw,</span>
<span class="i0">That they never had known such a pious Jackdaw!</span>
<span class="i4">He long lived the pride</span>
<span class="i4">Of that country side,</span>
<span class="i0">And at last in the odour of sanctity died;</span>
<span class="i4">When, as words were too faint</span>
<span class="i4">His merits to paint,</span>
<span class="i0">The conclave determined to make him a Saint;</span>
<span class="i0">And on newly-made Saints and Popes, as you know,</span>
<span class="i0">It's the custom at Rome new names to bestow,</span>
<span class="i0">So they canoniz'd him by the name of Jem Crow!</span>

<h2>PERIODICAL LITERATURE OF<br />THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS.</h2>

<p class="indent">It is an astounding but gratifying proof of the rapid march
of civilization, that periodical literature springs up and flourishes among
tribes and nations which, but twenty or thirty years ago, had hardly
advanced a few steps beyond barbarism. A Cherokee newspaper
has for some time been published, and in the Sandwich Islands a
gazette has recently been established; and a file of a paper called
"the Indian Ph&oelig;nix," published in the United States, under the
superintendence of an Indian editor, and addressed exclusively to his
countrymen, has just fallen under our notice. These are pleasing facts
for the consideration of every true philanthropist, and stable data on
which the philosopher may argue that the day is not far distant when
the rays of knowledge shall illumine every nation of the earth. Wherever
a newspaper is established, ignorance must diminish; for the newspaper
is not only the effect, but the cause of civilization,&mdash;not only
the work itself, but the means by which the work is performed. The
Indian Ph&oelig;nix is published in the English language at Washington,
and is from thence distributed among these roving aborigines, not
only in every part of the United States, but throughout the vast
territories of Mexico and Texas. The paper is not only edited, but
printed by Indians; and, whatever may be said of the intellectual
portions of it, the mechanical parts will certainly bear comparison
with the provincial journals of England, and are much before the
newspapers of several of the nations of Europe, those of Germany
and Portugal for instance, which are as wretched specimens of typography
as it is now possible to meet with.</p>

<p class="indent">For the amusement of our readers we shall proceed to make
a few extracts from these very curious journals. The principles which are
advocated therein will, no doubt, appear startling at first sight; but a
little reflection will show, that, although strange, they are not
altogether unfounded. These men have, by the strong arms of European
civilization, been driven from the wild forests inherited by their
forefathers, the woods they hunted in have been converted into corn-fields,
and the clear waters of the lonely rivers beside which they dwelt have
been contaminated by the refuse of smoky manufactories, and rendered
busy with the sails and paddle-wheels of enterprising commerce.
The civilization which thus came upon the land from afar
has now reached its original inhabitants; and the Indians, savages
no more, have begun to employ the arts of peace and the powerful
weapons of opinion to reconquer a portion of the broad lands of which
they have been despoiled. The struggles in Texas, and the unsettled
state of Mexico, have caused them to turn their eyes in that
direction; and they have been inspired by the hope that Mexico is
to be the region in which all the scattered tribes will be collected
together to form one great independent nation. It is not intended in
this brief notice to speculate upon the probability or improbability of
such a scheme, or to say whether or not these dispersed and dismembered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
clans, without leader or bond of union, will ever be able to
accomplish so gigantic a project. It is sufficient to state that such is
their object, in order that the reader may understand the allusions in
the extracts which we shall place before him. The following will show
the prose these Indians are capable of writing (we shall come to their
poetry by and by), and will also give an idea of their political creed.
In the leading article of the first number, the editor says,</p>

<p class="indent">"Our creed may be met with in these words. We render unto
the self-esteemed civilized world the things which are the self-esteemed
civilized world's, and unto the long-oppressed, yet noble, elevated,
and dignified Indian the things which once belonged and shall again belong to him."</p>

<p class="indent">These sentiments, and their open avowal, although they
may not cause the settler to tremble for the safety of his homestead, ought
nevertheless to make the statesman ponder well on the condition
and aspirations of this ill-used race. The editor continues:</p>

<p class="indent">"In the deep gloom of the future position of these countries
we see no evidence of a single periodical grasping with energetic vision
the coming time. Alone, therefore, do we step on the arena of public
opinion. With nerved heart and nerved hand shall we advance: the
curiosity of the many, the surprise of others, the encouragement of
the few, the denunciations of the National Gazette, or New York
American, or all who may follow in their fetid and nauseous trail,
shall not turn wide one of the barbed arrows which shall now and
henceforth be launched unsparingly at all who cross our path."&mdash;"We
are not mad, most noble Festus, but speak the words of truth and soberness."</p>

<p class="indent">The following little bit of Scriptural exposition will, no
doubt, cause a smile even on the grave faces of the learned doctors who are
versed in Biblical knowledge. The Indians, stigmatized by the civilized
nations of the earth for the cruel practice of scalping their fallen
enemies, bring forward the authority of our sacred book in their
justification. Even David, the man after God's own heart, and one of
the finest poets the world ever produced, went out on the war-path
like a Mohican or a Cherokee, and bore away the scalps of his enemies!
The editor hints that this alone would warrant the assertion
which has been so often put forth, that America was peopled by the
lost ten tribes of Israel. He says,</p>

<p class="indent">"We invite the attention&mdash;we throw down the gauntlet
of defiance to all and every civilized Christian in Europe or America to gainsay
or dispute the correctness or validity of the inferences and facts
stated below. The Scriptures say,</p>

<p class="indent">"'And Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David; and they told Saul,
and the thing pleased him.</p>

<p class="indent">"'And Saul said, I will give him her that she may be a snare to
him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.</p>

<p class="indent">"'And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David: the king
desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be
avenged on the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David
fall by the hand of the Philistines.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Wherefore David arose, he and his men, and slew of the
Philistines two hundred men, and David brought their foreskins, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
gave them in full toll to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law.'</p>

<p class="indent">"We see from this," (continues the editor of the Ph&oelig;nix,)
"that David, who was a great Jewish warrior, went out on the war-path not
from any motive of war, or to revenge the death of his fallen comrades;
but for what? Why, to get a marriage portion to lay before
the king of the Jewish nation. And what was this marriage portion?
Lo! it was one hundred <i>scalps</i> of the
Philistines. *&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*</p>

<p class="indent">At the conclusion we are told that Michal, Saul's daughter,
loved him. Why? <i>Because he was a great warrior, who had taken many scalps,
and, moreover, David behaved himself wisely, that is, cunning, in taking
of scalps from the Philistines, so that his name was much set by.</i> As
the Jews were in the time of Saul and David, so are the Indian
tribes of the West and of North America. They go out on the war-path,
they return with scalps; and the daughters of the tribe sing,
as in the days of David, 'The warrior Dutch hath slain his tens, but
the warrior Smith hath slain his fifties in the villages of the Tarwargans.'"</p>

<p class="indent">The following is a specimen of the poetry,&mdash;one of the
war-songs of these regenerated Indians. We cannot say it is quite equal to the
prose, but it is certainly more curious.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Indian chiefs, arise!</span>
<span class="i12">The glorious hour's gone forth,</span>
<span class="i10">And in the world's eyes</span>

<span class="i10">Indian chiefs, let us go</span>
<span class="i10">In arms to Mexico;</span>
<span class="i10">Till the Spanish blood shall flow</span>
<span class="i12">In a river at our feet.</span>

<span class="i10">Then, manfully despising</span>
<span class="i12">The pale faces' yoke,</span>
<span class="i10">Let your tribes see you rising</span>
<span class="i12">Till your chains is broke!"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Fastidious readers may object both to the vigour and the grammar
of the above; but we have still richer specimens in store for them.</p>

<p class="indent">The song continues:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"As rose the tribes of <i>Judah</i></span>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">The rhymes of "Judah" and "good a" and "standard" and "vanguard,"
are tolerably original; but they are beaten hollow by that of
the last verse, "Oneida" and "divide a-"!&mdash;"-Mong you when you're
there," is a sequel which has much more truth than elegance in it.
"-Mong you (<i>when you're there</i>?)" we would suggest as a new and
improved reading of the passage. The following is in a much more
elevated style; there is a rough vigour about it which many of our
own namby-pamby poetasters would do well to imitate. The rhymes
are also more felicitous, and the measure and grammar
less objectionable.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"The mountain sheep are sweeter,</span>
<span class="i12">But the valley sheep are fatter;</span>

<span class="i10">We planned an expedition:</span>
<span class="i12">We met a host, and quelled it;</span>
<span class="i10">We took a strong position,</span>
<span class="i12">And killed the men who held it!"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">The above stanza is unique. Every line tells; and there is a
raciness, a tartness about it, if we may so express it,
which is quite delightful.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"<i>The valley sheep are fatter;</i></span>
<span class="i10"><i>We therefore deemed it meeter</i></span>
<span class="i12"><i>To carry off the latter.</i>"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Many ballads have been written about Rob Roy, who also
had a sneaking inclination for the "fat sheep" of other people: but the
daring simplicity of these lines has never been surpassed.</p>

<p class="indent"> The song continues:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"On Norte's richest valley,</span>
<span class="i12">There herds of kine were browsing;</span>
<span class="i10">We made a nightly sally</span>
<span class="i12">To furnish our carousing.</span>
<span class="i10">Fierce soldiers rushed to meet us,</span>
<span class="i12">We met them, and o'erthrew them;</span>
<span class="i10">They struggled hard to beat us,</span>
<span class="i12">But we conquered them, and slew them!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i12">But, ere our force we led off,</span>
<span class="i10">Some sacked his house and cellars,</span>
<span class="i12">While others cut his head off."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Poetry has always been allowed some licence, and we suppose
we must pass over the assertion in the last line, by merely observing by
the way that Santa Anna is, in vulgar phrase, still "alive and kicking."</p>

<p class="indent">The song ends thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"We then, in strife bewildering,</span>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">The foregoing extracts are all in a warlike strain. We will
now give a few specimens of the softer lyrics in which these <i>scalpers</i>
indulge. The Irish melodies of Moore are, it appears, not unknown
even amongst them; and that they are admired, the following imitation,
or rather parody, of one of the most beautiful of them will
sufficiently show.</p>

<p class="indent">Interspersed through the papers are various imitations
of our poets, especially of Scott, Byron, and Mrs. Hemans. As an apology for
the plagiarisms, the editor places over the poet's corner the following motto:</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">
"To the living poets we beg to say, that it not being fair for them
to monopolize the best words in the language we write in, to say nothing
of the ideas, we take free liberty with them when need is.
We will make them amends two years hence when they come to see
us in the valleys of Mexico. To the illustrious dead we shall fully
explain our reasons when we may chance to meet them in the 'great elsewhere.'"</p>

<p class="indent">The next specimen is an imitation of Ossian, a bard
whose poetry must necessarily possess many charms for them.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, all ye warriors! come with your chief&mdash;come!
The song rises like the sun in my soul! I feel the joys of other times. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
Cherokee was on the land of Arkansas. The strange warriors of the
prairie were rich in horses. We said in our souls, why not give the
Tarwargans of their abundance? Six of our warriors were found on
the great prairie, advancing like the moon among clouds, concealed
from the view. Days had passed when they approached the
wigwams of the Tarwargans. A narrow plain spreads beneath, covered
with grass and aged trees. The blue course of a stream is
there. The horses were secured. Their feet were slowly advancing
towards the wigwams. Not without eyes were the Tarwargans.
The warriors had not been invisible. High hopes of prairie horses
and the scalps of the enemy fill their souls. A blast came upon
them. The sound of rifles was heard in the air. Three of the warriors
fell! The tomahawk descended, and they were left in their
shame without scalps. Two warriors fled together. <span class="smcap">Smoke</span>
(a warrior) fled not: he rushed for safety, and laid himself low with
his rifle among the briers. Shouts of triumph are heard. The Tarwargans
return. The slain are dragged to the dancing-ground&mdash;oh,
grief! oh, revenge! Did you not know the heart of <i>Smoke</i>?
Placed in the ground are three stakes; tied are the scalpless dead!
Upright they sit. Oh, grief! the derision of the Tarwargans! 'Cunning
warriors are ye, oh, Cherokees! but your scalps are at our feet.'"</p>

<p class="indent">The following, which the editor assures us is a literal
translation from an old song highly popular among the aboriginal tribes of
Mexico, is interesting. The poetry of the original is so sublime that
the translator, in despair of equalling it in rhyme, has given it us in
plain prose.</p>

the snows of Istaccihuatl, and on the tops of the mountains of Orizaba.
Toktepec, and Chinantla, and Matlalzinco were strong warriors,

<h3>CHAPTER 1.</h3>

<p class="indent">"A century or two ago, there was a class of dependents or
hangers-on to the great families in Ireland, denominated 'running-footmen,' who
may truly be looked upon as originals in their singular, laborious, and
sometimes even dangerous calling. Though ostensibly mere letter-carriers,
or light-parcel bearers, across the difficult parts of the
country, as yet inaccessible to carriages, or even quadrupeds, (or rendered
passable by that style of road-making which the <i>Colossus of
Roads</i>, Macadam, pretended was <i>his</i> discovery,) the running-footmen
had occasionally charges of more serious import. They were often
suspected of being the agents by whom political measures of local
warfare were transmitted from baronial sovereigns to their distant
clanships or allies,&mdash;of being walking, or rather running, telegraphs
(for their speed was prodigious) of some plot of treason against the
rights of the invader, and often cruelly and unjustly sacrificed to his
fury, when intercepted on their secret but seldom hostile missions.
They carried their notions of honour on the point of their trust, whatever
it might be, to a romantic scrupulosity. No matter whether it
was a love-letter or a challenge, a purse or a process, a curse or a
blessing, the faithful runner never revealed it to any one but the person
for whom it was intended. Though journeying by the most difficult
passes, and undergoing the most severe privations, those extraordinary
fellows seldom failed in their undertakings. This may be
partially accounted for by the reverence they were held in by their
own people; for as the lower Irish still continue to believe in the
strange notion of their Oriental ancestors, that the souls of 'innocents'
(in plainer English, 'fools,') are in heaven, and that their
'muddy vesture of decay' on earth is entitled to superstitious
respect, these motleys, in either their real or assumed garb of folly,
were treated with a kind of familiar or affectionate reverence wherever
they went amongst their own countrymen. On the other hand,
the paths of their treading, when they went out upon distant journeys,
were so little known to the hostile strangers, that they ran but little
chance of receiving injury at their hands, or even meeting with them.
Such were the running-footmen of other days; but they are gone,&mdash;their
<i>race</i> is ended,&mdash;and those who pride themselves upon their
descent from the stock seem to have retained but few of the qualifications
of their ancestors. Everything romantic and happy in Ireland
seems to be dwindling away. No longer do we hear the pleasant
announcements of 'Blind Connal the harper, sir,' and 'Miss Biddy
Maquillian the fiddler, my lady,' and 'Dermot O'Dowd the piper,
boys,' and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">I had just read so far in some work or other which I had
carelessly taken up for a peep after dinner one day, when a loud knock at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
door of my apartment made me close the book, and say "Come in!"
The door slowly opened; but, as nobody entered, I demanded "Who's there?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It's me, masther; Darby, yir honor."&mdash;"What do you want?"
inquired I.&mdash;"Nothing, sir," said he, "but I've got a letther for ye,
sir."&mdash;"From whom?" said I.&mdash;"Faix, I don't know, sir," replied he
archly; "for I haven't read it yit; but here it is."&mdash;"Why don't you
come in and give it to me?" demanded I.&mdash;"I'm afraid, sir," said he,
"that my brogues would dirty the carpet, and set all the girls in the
kitchen a-laughing at me for comin' into the drawin'-room; and sure
a purtier room a man need never wish to come into."&mdash;"Oh! very
well," said I, rising; "you shall have your way, Darby."&mdash;"Am I to
wait for an answer, sir?" said he, giving me the letter.&mdash;"No," replied
I; "I'll ring if it be necessary."&mdash;"Thank yir honor," said
Darby, and turned to descend the stairs with the furtive caution of a
cat when stealing upon its prey, lest he should make his brogues
audible. A loud crash, succeeded by a louder laugh, through which
I distinctly heard, "<i>Merry bad look to yiz all!</i>" convinced me that
Darby's coming up stairs with the letter was a contrivance of the
other servants to play some trick upon him, which their merriment
seemed to show had succeeded; but into which as I did not care to
inquire, I sate down, opened my letter, and began to read. I had not
proceeded far before I found it related to business of the most serious
consequence, and required that I should write <i>instanter</i> to a friend,
who was on a visit at Bally&mdash;&mdash;, (nearly forty miles distant across
the country,) and have an answer by immediate return of post. There
was no time to be lost; so I wrote my letter as speedily as possible,
folded, sealed, and directed it, then rang the bell with unusual
impatience. It was promptly answered; but this time there was no knock
at the door before it opened, for it was Eileen, my usual attendant,
that presented herself, with a face whose natural health, cheerfulness,
and rustic beauty were considerably heightened by the flush of recent
merriment.</p>

<p class="indent">"What have you been doing with Darby, Eileen?" said I.&mdash;"<i>Oh,
widdy-eelish!</i>" (her constant ejaculation) said she laughing, "nothing
at all, sir; only he said he wanted to see the drawin'-room, so we sent
him up with the letter, and he slipped his foot as he came down, sir;
that's all."&mdash;"You know I don't like those tricks, Eileen," said I,
with all the severity I could muster against her smothered laughter.&mdash;"No,
sir; I know, sir; but when an <i>omadhaun</i> like that&mdash;"&mdash;"Silence!"
said I. "I want to send a letter by the post: what o'clock
is it?"&mdash;"Half an hour too late, sir," said Eileen, resuming her gravity;
"and there'll be no post to-morrow."&mdash;"No post to-morrow!"
echoed I.&mdash;"No sir; to-morrow's Saturday, you know."&mdash;"Confusion!"
said I, "it will be so indeed. What's to be done?"&mdash;"I don't
know, sir," replied Eileen despondingly; "how far is it?"&mdash;"Oh!
nearly forty miles across the country," cried I; "and I want an answer
immediately."&mdash;"Can't Darby <i>run</i> across with it?" said Eileen.&mdash;"<i>Run</i>
across with it!" cried I; "is the girl out of her senses? Run across
forty miles, as if it were nothing more than a hop-step-and-jump!"&mdash;"He'll
do it in that same, sir," said Eileen seriously, "if
ye'll only tell him what it is."&mdash;"<i>Who</i>'ll do it?" cried I
impatiently.&mdash;"Why, Darby, sir," said she; "Darby in the kitchen, that's known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
all the country round for Darby the Swift."&mdash;"What!" cried I, "that
fellow that brought me the letter just now? Impossible!"&mdash;"There's
nothing impossible to God, sir, you know,&mdash;glory be to his name!" said
Eileen, "and so the <i>crathur</i> has the gift of it: he'll do it, I warrant
ye." I looked up in Eileen's face, and saw there was something beyond
common opinion pleading for Darby; so, waiving all farther
parley, I desired her to go down stairs and send him to me instantly.
Eileen curtsied, and, retiring, shut the door; but immediately opened
it again, saying "You don't want him the night, sir, do ye? for,"
added she with a loud laugh, "I think he has broken his shin-bone."&mdash;"Send
him to me immediately," said I peremptorily; upon which
Eileen, exclaiming "<i>Oh, widdy-eelish!</i>" made her exit.</p>

<p class="indent">Now it was evident from her last words that Eileen, in
conjunction with others, had done some injury to poor Darby in their gambols;
but as he is just coming up stairs, and will make a long pause before
he presumes to knock at the door a second time, allow me, gentle
reader, <i>ad interim</i>, to present you with a portrait of my servant,
or follower, "<span class="smcap">Darby Ryan</span>," nick-named "<i>The Swift</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">Darby Ryan was about thirty years of age, middle-sized,
not over stout, and tolerably well made. His hair, both in texture and tint,
resembled the <i>raddled</i> back of a fawn-coloured goat, and waved in
shaggy luxuriance everywhere save on his forehead, in the middle
of which it timidly descended in a close-cropped peak, till it nearly
united itself with two enormous dark-coloured eyebrows. His eyes
were small, and the blackest I have ever seen; with a gleam of fire
occasionally, that lent them more archness than ferocity. Some
thought he squinted, and said that, though under <i>one</i> master's direction,
his <i>two pupils</i> went contrary ways; but I believe this was all
slander, and only set forth by jealous people, who themselves, it is
said, are rather queer in their optics. A <i>fracas</i> in a hurling-match
had left his nose little more than a one-arched bridge, by which, if
you please, we will pass along to his mouth, where, if I had the time,
I could find ample <i>room</i> for <i>rum</i>ination, &amp;c. But Darby has
knocked at my door, and I am forced to say "Come in!"&mdash;"Did yir honor
want me, sir? or is it only the <i>caileen</i>'s fun, and the rest of them, in
the kitchen?" said Darby, opening the door, but remaining outside as
before. "Come in," said I encouragingly, "and take a seat for a
moment; I'll tell you what I want with you." The girl's fears for
the carpet were quite right; for Darby, making a bow to me on his
entrance, scraped about a pound of mud off his brogues, which would
have discomfited him quite if I had not proceeded with "Do you know
the road to Bally&mdash;&mdash;? Can you find your way to it safely, Darby?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Can a duck swim, yir honor?" said Darby, emboldened by degrees.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! very well, I understand you," said I. "Now, mark me:
I want you to take this letter to a friend of mine, who is on a visit with
the clergyman there, and bring me an answer as speedily as possible.
Are you so quick-footed as they say?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Quick-<i>futted</i>!" said Darby, seating himself on the
very corner of the nearest chair; "where there's a will there's a way, as the sayin'
is: but I was never counted slow anyhows but oncet, and that was
when I made the clock stop of its own accord on a Patrick's Day,
and sure, when we broke up our party, we found it was two days afterwards."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Well, take care and be more sparing of your time for the present,"
said I, anxious to despatch him.</p>

<p class="indent">"You may rely on it, sir," said he; "I'll spare <i>nather</i>
time nor trouble in the doin' of it, although it is letter-carryin'."</p>

<p class="indent">"Letter-carrying!" said I; "and pray what is there
disgraceful in the calling?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! nothing at all disgraceful in the <i>calling</i>, sir," said Darby,
"as yir honor says, but quite the reverse, if the letters are not paid aforehand."</p>

<p class="indent">"You would not surely appropriate the postage to yourself?"
said I, looking severely, though I did not exactly comprehend him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it me, sir?&mdash;<i>Pop</i>eriate the king's pocket money
in that way, poor ould gentleman! I'm not in parliament yet, nor ever had a fine
situation under government, like yir honor."</p>

<p class="indent">"Be not impertinent, sir," said I sharply; "I'd have you
know and keep your distance." Darby rose immediately from the chair, of
which about this time he had occupied nearly one half, saying,</p>

<p class="indent">"Any distance you like for a short time, sir; for it's myself
would grieve to part you for ever. What's the word of command, sir, and
I'm off?&mdash;Right or left, north or south, Darby Ryan's yir man 'gainst
wind or tide, as was said of one of my posteriors&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Your ancestors you mean," said I smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">"My <i>aunt's sisters</i>, yir honor! Faith and he wasn't one of her
<i>sisters</i>, nor one of my <i>four</i> fathers either,&mdash;for he was neither my
godfather, nor my own father, nor my grandfather, nor my great-grandfather;
but, as I said afore, one of my pos&mdash;pos&mdash;pos&mdash;<i>terity</i>, (I have
the word now, divil take it!) that was christened <span class="smcap">Ryan the Racer</span>,
for bein' runnin' futtman ages ago to the first quality in the country."</p>

<p class="indent">By this time I began to perceive that, however quick Darby's
heels might be, they had a formidable rival in his tongue; so I endeavoured
to check <i>it</i> at once by saying, "I have no time now to attend to any
stories about your ancestry or relations; I merely wish to know can
you take this letter to its direction, and speedily bring me an answer
to it: in a word, can you set our immediately, and travel all night?"&mdash;"All
night, yir honor! is it all night that's in yir mind?" said
Darby, evidently hurt at my inquiry: "Gog's blud!" he continued
half apart, "I was never taken for a turkey afore."&mdash;"A turkey!"
said I, quite at a loss to understand him.&mdash;"Yes, yir honor," said
Darby, "a turkey&mdash;the very worst <i>baste</i> on the road for a long
stretch (barrin' his neck) that ever was christened! Did yir honor ever
hear of the wager 'tween the goose and him?"&mdash;"Never," said I
sullenly.&mdash;"Then I'm glad of it, masther," said Darby rejoicingly, "for
it gives me the pleasure of tellin' it to yir honor. You see, sir, that
oncet upon a time there was an ould cock-turkey&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;"Cock
and a bull!" said I, losing all patience; "go down stairs! I don't want
you at all."&mdash;"No sir; I know you don't, sir," said Darby with most
provoking perseverance; "but I thought ye'd like to hear how an
ould gander sarved the bull-turkey, big as he was."&mdash;"Well, then,"
said I in despair, "go on."&mdash;"Thank ye, sir," said Darby, and then
continued, while I from time to time anxiously looked at my watch,
stirred the fire, or fidgeted myself in twenty different ways, in the
hope of interrupting him; but all to no purpose. "Then you see,
sir, oncet upon a time an ould cock-turkey lived in the barony of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
Brawny, or, let me see, was it in Inchebofin, or Tubbercleer?&mdash;faix!
an' it's myself forgets that same at the present writin',&mdash;but Jim
Gurn&mdash;you know Jim Gurn, yir honor, Jim Gurn the nailor that lives
hard by,&mdash;him that fought his black and tan t'other day 'gainst Tim
Fagan's silver-hackle,&mdash;oh! Jim is the boy that'll tell ye the <i>ins</i> and
<i>outs</i> of it any day yir honor wud pay him a visit, 'caze Jim's in the
way of it. Well, as I was relatin', the turkey was a parson's bird,
and as proud as Lucifer, bein' used to the best of livin'; while the
gander was only a poor <i>commoner</i>, for he was a <i>Roman</i>, and <i>oblidged</i>
to live upon what he could get by the road-side. These two fowls,
yir honor, never could agree any how,&mdash;never could put up their
horses together on any blessed pint,&mdash;till one day a big row happened
betwune them, when the gander challenged the turkey to a steeple-chase
across the country, day and dark, for twenty-four hours. Well,
to my surprise,&mdash;tho' I wasn't there at the time, but Jim Gurn was,
who gave me the whole history,&mdash;to my surprise, the turkey didn't
say <i>no</i> to it, but was quite agreeable all of a suddent; so away they
started from Jim Gurn's dunghill one Sunday after mass, for the gander
wouldn't stir a step afore prayers. Well, to be sure, to give the
divil his due, the turkey took the lead in fine style, and was soon
clane out of sight; but the gander kept movin' on, no ways downhearted,
after him. About night-fall it was his business to pass
through an ould archway acrass the road; and as he was stoopin' his
head to get under it,&mdash;for yir honor knows a gander will stoop his
head under a doorway if it was only as high as the moon,&mdash;who
should he see comfortably sated in an ivy bush but the turkey himself,
tucked in for the night. The gander, winkin' to himself, says,
'Is it there ye are, honey?'&mdash;but he kept never mindin' him for all
that, but only walked bouldly on to his journey's end, where he arrived
safe and sound next day, afore the turkey was out of his first
sleep: 'caze why, ye see, sir, a goose or a gander will travel all night;
but in respect of a turkey, once the day falls in, divil another inch of
ground he'll put his futt to, barrin' it's to roost in a tree or the
rafters of a cow-house! Oh! maybe the parson's bird wasn't ashamed
of himself! Jim Gurn says he never held his head up afterward,
tho' to be sure he hadn't long to fret, for Christmas was nigh at hand,
and he had to stand sentry by the kitchen fire one day without his
body-clothes 'till he could bear it no longer; so they <i>dished</i> him
<i>intirely</i>. <i>Them</i> that <i>ett</i> him said he was as tough as
leather, no doubt from the grief: but, divil's cure to him! what bisness
had he to be so proud of himself, the spalpeen!"</p>

<p class="indent">Darby <i>at length</i> came to a pause. I paused also for
a minute to understand the application of his anecdote; but it was evident:
he wished to impress me by his parable that he was fitted for the task I
had allotted him; so I inquired what money he would want on the road.</p>

<p class="indent">"Maybe yir honor wouldn't think half-a-crown too much?
said he diffidently.</p>

<p class="indent">"Half-a-crown!" exclaimed I, amazed at the modesty
of his demand: "here are ten shillings; and, if you be quick in your
errand, I will give you something extra on your return."</p>

<p class="indent">"Musha, an' long life to yir honor!" said Darby, scraping
the carpet again; "may the grass never grow on the pathway to yir dwellin',
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
nor a baste or Christian ever die belongin' t' ye, barrin' it's for the
use of the kitchen!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, now prepare for the road," said I impatiently,
"and be off at once."</p>

<p class="indent">"An' that I will, sir, in the twinklin' of a bedstead; only,
you see, I've just got to run up to Tim Fallon the barber's to take the stubble
off of my chin. Tim&mdash;(you know Tim Fallon, yir honor.)&mdash;Tim won't
keep me long, anyhow, for it's late in the day, and his tongue must
be dry by this; but if ye wud hear him of a mornin, oh! it's a
<i>trate</i>, for Tim was once a play-acthur afore he grew a barber, an'
by that same a good barber he is. Did he ever <i>lather</i> yir honor?"&mdash;I
made no reply. "After that," continued Darby, "I'll just step
home and put on my Sunday clothes, and then won't I be as fresh as
a two-year ould to do yir honor's biddin'!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, well, lose no time," said I impatiently.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sorrow a minute," said Darby: "I'll be there and back
agin in the shoot of a wishin' star. Maybe yir honor knows what a wishin'
star is?"&mdash;I shook my head. "Well, then," continued Darby, "yir
honor, no doubt, has been out o'doors of a fine starlight night?"&mdash;I
nodded assent. "Well then, agin, I'll tell ye what a wishin' star is.
Did ye ever sit yir heart upon havin' of anything sir?" "Yes," said
I morosely.&mdash;"Might I be so bould as to ax in regard to what, sir?"
inquired Darby.&mdash;"Why, in regard, as you call it, to the letter I
have given you just now," replied I; "I wish to have it delivered
as quickly as possible."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! that bein' the case, sir," said Darby somewhat disconcerted,
"I'm off at once."&mdash;"At once be it, then," said I, opening the door
for him.&mdash;"I've only, then, to give the letther, sir," said he
lingeringly, "to the gentleman at the clargy's? But ye didn't tell
me whether it was the priest or the parson he's stoppin' with."&mdash;"The
parson," said I, with all the patience I could command.&mdash;"Oh,
very well, sir. God take care of ye till I come back!" So saying,
he shut the door after him; but, before I could seat myself in my
chair, he opened it again, inquiring "If he left his hat in the drawin'-room?"
The only answer I made was by taking up the <i>caubeen</i>,
which lay on the carpet, and flinging it in his face, out of all patience.
"Thank yir honor," said Darby, and retired again, as I hoped, to
proceed on his journey, But, alas! I was mistaken. Five minutes
had scarcely elapsed when he presented himself once more, with a
request that I might allow him to take <i>Squib</i>, my pointer dog, with
him as a companion. "The road's so drary," said he, "by one's self,
you know, yir honour."&mdash;"Well, take him, in God's name," said I,
hastily shutting the door after him, and glad to be rid of him at any
concession.</p>

<p class="indent">I again resumed my seat, and opened the volume I had
been reading; but I had not got through more than twenty or thirty pages
of marvellous matter, when I thought I heard Darby's voice in the
yard. On going to the window, I found that it was indeed <i>he</i>, and
"<i>as spruce as a Scotch fir</i>," to use one of his own expressions.</p>

<p class="indent">"Not gone yet!" exclaimed I, furiously throwing up the
sash. But it was of no use, for he replied with the most perfect coolness,
"Oh, yes, sir, I <i>was</i> gone half an hour ago; only, you see, I've come
back for the <i>clieve</i> that's to carry <i>Squib</i> to the place where he'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
find divarsion in runnin' about in the pleasure-grounds hard by Squire
Markhim's inclosure; 'twould kill the baste (God pard'n me for
callin' him so, for he's more like a Christian,) to walk him so far: and
maybe I'll not bring ye home a brace or two of birds that he'll point
at without seein', and a <i>blue peter</i> or so, if yir honor wud only just
give me a charge or two of powder and shot."</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you wish to get into the hands of the police?" said I.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! then, is it the Peelers," said Darby contemptuously, "that
yir honor manes? Divil a one o' them will be out of his <i>flay</i>-park
by the time I'm crossing the <i>Callas</i> with Squib and Pat Fagan's ould
carbine, that he'll lend me out o' the bog-hole, where he keeps it
from the rust and the guagers: and sure, while we're oilin' it with a
bit of goose-grace, that it mayn't burst intirely the first goin' off, I
can have a bit of gossip with the ould woman in the chimly corner
over the <i>greeshah</i>, and find out everything about the gintleman in the
neighb'rhood that I'm takin' the letther to; for poor Katty Fagan, ever
since she lost the brindled heifer, and young Jemmeen her grandson,
that they cut out for a priest, and another calf that she won at a
weddin' raffle, all in the typhus s<i>a</i>son,&mdash;you recollect the
typhus, yir honor?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, curse you and the typhus together!" said I.&mdash;"Well,
an' it's myself that never could spake a good word for it either, masther, bad
look to 't!" said Darby: "but, be that as it may, ever since that time
Katty knows more of every other body's bisness nor her own; so I'll
lose nothin' by callin' to ax her how she is at laste, thov' it is a
mile or two out o' my way."</p>

<p class="indent">By this time, reader, you may conclude my power of
endurance was pretty nigh exhausted; so, raking down a pair of pistols that
hung over the fire-place, I said, "The only powder and shot, my
good fellow, that I can spare you at present, are contained in these
two barrels; you are welcome to them, and shall have them on the
spot, if you do not depart immediately!"&mdash;"Ah! then it's myself
that wud <i>depart</i> imm<i>a</i>diately, sure enough, sir," said Darby,
"if yir honor wud only pull the trigger; but keep yir hands off o' them,
masther avick, for, charge or no charge, they might go aff and spile
my beauty for ever: the divil, they say, can fire an empty charge as
well as a full one!"&mdash;"Well, then," said I, "take your choice: <i>go off</i>
this moment, or one of these shall!"&mdash;"Oh, then, sure that's no
choice at all, at all, sir," replied Darby; "so I suppose I must go my
ways. Well, then, wid ye be wid ye, for I can't always be wid ye.
Is there anything else I can do for ye, sir, on the road?"&mdash;"Nothing,"
said I: "begone!"&mdash;"Thank ye, sir," said he, and retired.</p>

<p class="indent">"Thank Heaven!" said I, "the fellow has at last set out
on his journey." So I again turned to the marvellous volume, and was
about halfway through the pedestrian exploits of Collier and his
sister, who, to use the words of the writer, "thought nothing of putting
a pot of <i>pink-eyes</i> down to boil, and <i>stepping</i> to the next
market-town (about nine miles distant) for a halfpenny-worth of salt (returning,
too, again) before the white horses were on the praties," when
Eileen presented herself in such a convulsion of laughter that it was
some moments before she could reply to my question of "What's
the matter?" At length, terminating with a long-drawn sigh, and
her usual "<i>widdy-eelish</i>," she replied, "Nothing's the matter, sir;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
only&mdash;only&mdash;" (laughing again) "only Darby, sir."&mdash;"Darby!" exclaimed
I, "what of <i>him</i>?"&mdash;"He wants to know, sir," said she, "if
you will allow him to take a <i>horse</i> with him."&mdash;"A <i>horse</i>!" exclaimed
I; "devil take the fellow! what does he mean?"&mdash;"Why, I mane,
to be sure," said Darby from the bottom of the stairs, at the same
time at the top of his voice, "a <i>horse</i> from the young ash-plants in
the ould garden. I'll cut the crookedest I can find, though a straight
one would do me betther."&mdash;"What is it he wants?" said I, turning
to Eileen, who was in a perfect <i>kink</i> of laughter.&mdash;"Oh! widdy-eelish,"
replied she, "I suppose the crather means a pole to help
him over the bogs."&mdash;"Let me talk to the rascal myself," said I,
going to the door in a deuce of a rage.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yir sarvant, sir," said Darby, taking his hat off and making a
scrape that cost <i>him</i> his equilibrium, and <i>me</i> my gravity, for I could
not but sympathise with Eileen's outrageous laughter. "Is it possible
that you are here yet?" inquired I, endeavouring to be as severe as possible.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, never fear, sir, but I'll be off presently," said he: "my
walk's waitin' for me on the road; I'll overtake it imm<i>a</i>diately."</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm sorry that you have undertaken it at all," said I in a
tone of unusual displeasure.</p>

<p class="indent">"Undertaken, sir! undertake&mdash;undertaker!" said
Darby rather indignantly; "I never was an undertaker but oncet, and that
was at my ould father's funeral, when I was one of the nine bearers. That
was a beautiful sight, to be sure," said he, kindling into rapture as
he proceeded; "Ah! that was the beautiful sight, agrah! I seen
many a lord's berrin', but none to come up to that. Oh! it would
do any one's heart good to see us walkin' in <i>possession</i> to the Abbey,&mdash;it
was so d<i>a</i>cent, and all of a piece, like a magpie, white and black
from beginnin' to end! Oh! it was a beautiful sight, anyhow," added
he with a deep sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">"Did you, then, rejoice in your father's death?" said I harshly.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, not exactly rejoice in his death," replied Darby,
wiping away a tear from his already suffused eye, "for he was a kind ould
body to them he liked, though he didn't sp<i>a</i>ke to me good or bad for
three years afore he died: but never mind; maybe I wasn't hearty at his wake!"</p>

<p class="indent">"At his wake!" said I, with a look of disgust.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, yir honor!" replied he after a pause of
surprise,&mdash;"at his wake, to be sure; and where can a body be so alive
to fun of all sorts as at a well-conducted dead body's wake? Isn't there smokin',
and drinkin', and story-tellin', and now and then a bit of dancin' in
the other room with the young ones, to shake off the grief, eh? And
didn't I get seven goold guineas from 'Turney Gubbins, that was one
of his exec<i>u</i>tors, and the ould mare that used to take him from
town to town when he took to <i>fair</i> bisness, and the bracket hen that
lays yir honor's eggs now, that was the mother of all the p<i>a</i>ceable
fightin' cocks in the county; and, moreover, his white waistcoat and
breeches when he was in the Yeomen, that Ned Fallon the tailor says
he'll die any day for me into a second mournin'?"</p>

<p class="indent">"And what did you with the seven guineas?" said I: "did you
turn them to any account?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, the Lord bless yir honor!" said Darby sheepishly; "it's very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
hard to know what to do with a large sum of money now-a-days: it's
dangerous keepin' by you, you know, sir; so <i>I put it out to interest</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">"And pray what security did you get?" said I, suspecting something,
from the fellow's roguish leer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Security, sir?" said Darby; "they tould me it was <i>collatheral</i>, I
think, yir honor; <i>collatheral</i> was the word."</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Collateral</i>!" said I, somewhat surprised at his
knowledge of the term.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir," replied he, scratching his head with one hand, and
thrusting the other into his breeches pocket, "<i>I laid it out in</i>
<span class="smcap">HOUSES</span>. But, for all that, half an hour afore
I die I'll have as much money as'll do me all the days o' my life!"</p>

<p class="indent">I could not but smile at the fellow's satirical humour
upon his own  folly; and, as it was the first time I had ever admitted him
to such familiar converse, I patiently listened while he continued to tell me
how he "ran through his fortune" in less than three weeks; hoping,
however, that he would soon make an end of his recital, and set out
with my letter, for the day now began to decline.</p>

<p class="indent">"You see, yir honor, this was the way it happened," said Darby.
"<i>Nawthin'</i> would save me but I should give a <span class="smcap">Tay-Party</span>
at the Three Blacks one evenin' after a hurlin'-match&mdash;Did yir honor ever
hurl a bit? Oh! then sure it's the finest divarsion that any one
cud sit his mind upon, barrin' it doesn't ind in a row, as mostly for the
best part it does. But never mind that,&mdash;it's fine fun, anyhow;
though by it I <i>did</i> get this <i>clink</i> on the nose, that made me
lave off snuff-takin' ever since as a dirty habit! Oh! a hurlin'-match is a
grate sight, and many a good clergy I've seen strip to the work.
There was Father M'Gauvran&mdash;yir honor has heard of Father
M'Gauvran, that got a son an' heir for Pat Mac Gavany, by givin'
his wife an ould <i>surplus</i> that he had by him for some time? Oh! it
would raise the cockles of yir heart to see how he <i>wud</i> whip a ball
along. He was a <i>grate</i> hurler, anyhow; <i>he</i> was the
boy at the <i>bawke</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent">Conceiving that Darby would not terminate before midnight
(if he ever would at all), I interrupted him, saying, "When you return, I
shall be very happy to hear the particulars of your <span class="smcap">Tay-Party</span>,
but for the present I must decline the narrative. Set out, if you mean
to go: when you come back, I will listen vary attentively to the
whole recital."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">"Oh, then I suppose I'm tiring yir honor! But stop
a bit,&mdash;I'll be here in the turn of a snipe;" saying which, he disappeared.
I had not been long left to my own reflections before he came up stairs,
and, without any of his previous knocks and delays, he entered my
room hurriedly, and, throwing down a small book on the table before
me, said, "There, sir; I hope <i>that</i> will amuse you while I am away:
it's an account of my <i>tay-party</i>, by <i>Lame</i> Kelly the poet, that wudn't
get drunk that night <i>acause</i> he sed he wud write it afore his next
sleep. Read it, masther," said Darby; "and never mind the jokes
upon me."&mdash;"Go your ways," said I.&mdash;"I've only <i>one</i> way to go,
sir," said Darby.&mdash;"Well, then," said I, "in God's name take <i>that</i>."&mdash;"In
God's name be it, then," replied Darby, and ultimately left me.

this destroys all relish; or, if he know not how to use them for valuable
purposes, they are so far from being of any service to him, that they
often turn to real misfortunes." It is of no consequence that this profound
reflection is nothing to the purpose in the place where it appears,
because Chremes is not talking of any secret anguish, but of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
use or abuse made of advantages according to the disposition of the
individual to whom they have been accorded; and the anguish of
Clinia was by no means secret. He feared the perpetual displeasure
of his father, and knew not whether absence might not have diminished
or alienated the affections of the lady on whose account he
had abandoned home and country; but the general proposition of the
sentence cannot be denied. A "fatal remembrance"&mdash;to borrow a
phrase from one of the most beautiful of Moore's melodies&mdash;may render
a life, apparently abounding in prosperity, wretched and unhappy,
as the vitiation of a single humour of the eye casts a sickly and
unnatural hue over the gladsome meadow, or turns to a lurid light the
brilliancy of the sunniest skies.</p>

<p class="indent">Rasselas and Jaques have no secret anguish to torment
them, no real cares to disturb the even current of their tempers. To get rid
of the prince first:&mdash;His sorrow is no more than that of the starling
in the Sentimental Journey. He cannot get out. He is discontented,
because he has not the patience of Wordsworth's nuns, who fret
not in their narrow cells; or of Wordsworth's muse, which murmurs
not at being cribbed and confined to a sonnet. He wants the philosophy
of that most admirable of all jail-ditties,&mdash;and will not reflect that</p>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">And as his calamity is, after all, very tolerable,&mdash;as
many a sore heart or a wearied mind, buffeting about amid the billows and
breakers of the external world, would feel but too happy to exchange conditions
with him in his safe haven of rest,&mdash;it is no wonder that the weaving of
sonorous sentences of easily soothed sorrow should be the extent of
the mental afflictions of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia.</p>

<p class="indent">Who or what Jaques was before he makes his appearance in
the forest, Shakspeare does not inform us,&mdash;any farther than that he had
been a <i>roué</i> of considerable note, as the Duke tells him, when he proposes to</p>

<p class="indent">This, and that he was one of the three or four loving lords
who put themselves into voluntary exile with the old Duke, leaving their lands
and revenues to enrich the new one, who therefore gave them good
leave to wander, is all we know about him, until he is formally announced
to us as the melancholy Jaques. The very announcement
is a tolerable proof that he is not soul-stricken in any material degree.
When Rosalind tells him that he is considered to be a melancholy
fellow, he is hard put to it to describe in what his melancholy consists.

<p class="indent">He is nothing more than an idle gentleman given to
musing, and making invectives against the affairs of the world, which are more
remarkable for the poetry of their style and expression than the pungency
of their satire. His famous description of the seven ages of
man is that of a man who has seen but little to complain of in his
career through life. The sorrows of his infant are of the slightest
kind, and he notes that it is taken care of in a nurse's lap. The griefs
of his schoolboy are confined to the necessity of going to school;
and he, too, has had an anxious hand to attend to him. His shining
morning face reflects the superintendence of one&mdash;probably a
mother&mdash;interested in his welfare. The lover is tortured by no piercing
pangs of love, his woes evaporating themselves musically in a ballad
of his own composition, written not to his mistress, but fantastically
addressed to her eyebrow. The soldier appears in all the pride and
the swelling hopes of his spirit-stirring trade,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,</span>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">The fair round belly of the justice lined with good capon lets
us know how he has passed his life. He is full of ease, magisterial authority,
and squirely dignity. The lean and slippered pantaloon, and the
dotard sunk into second childishness, have suffered only the common
lot of humanity, without any of the calamities that embitter the
unavoidable malady of old age.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
All the characters in Jaques's sketch
are well taken care of. The infant is nursed; the boy educated; the
youth tormented with no greater cares than the necessity of hunting
after rhymes to please the ear of a lady, whose love sits so lightly
upon him as to set him upon nothing more serious than such a self-amusing
task; the man in prime of life is engaged in gallant deeds,
brave in action, anxious for character, and ambitious of fame; the
man in declining years has won the due honours of his rank, he enjoys
the luxuries of the table and dispenses the terrors of the bench; the
man of age still more advanced is well to do in the world. If his
shank be shrunk, it is not without hose and slipper,&mdash;if his eyes be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
dim, they are spectacled,&mdash;if his years have made him lean, they have
gathered for him wherewithal to fatten the pouch by his side. And
when this strange eventful history is closed by the penalties paid by
men who live too long, Jaques does not tell us that the helpless being,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">"Sans teeth, sans eyes,
sans taste, sans everything,"</p>

<p>is left unprotected in his helplessness.</p>

<p class="indent">Such pictures of life do not proceed from a man very
heavy at heart. Nor can it be without design that they are introduced into
this especial place. The moment before, the famished Orlando has
burst in upon the sylvan meal of the Duke, brandishing a naked
sword, demanding with furious threat food for himself and his helpless
companion,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">"Oppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger."</p>

<p class="indent">The Duke, struck with his earnest appeal, cannot refrain
from comparing the real suffering which he witnesses in Orlando with that
which is endured by himself and his "co-mates, and partners in exile."
Addressing Jaques, he says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy.</span>
<span class="i10">This wide and universal theatre</span>
<span class="i10">Presents more woful pageants than the scene</span>

</div></div>

<p>But the spectacle and the comment upon it lightly touch Jaques,
and he starts off at once into a witty and poetic comparison of
the real drama of the world with the mimic drama of the stage,
in which, with the sight of well-nurtured youth driven to the savage
desperation of periling his own life, and assailing that of
others,&mdash;and of weakly old age lying down in the feeble but
equally resolved desperation of dying by the wayside, driven to this
extremity by sore fatigue and hunger,&mdash;he diverts himself and his
audience, whether in the forest or theatre, on the stage or in the closet,
with graphic descriptions of human life; not one of them, proceeding
as they do from the lips of the <i>melancholy</i> Jaques, presenting
a single point on which true melancholy can dwell. Mourning over
what cannot be avoided must be in its essence common-place: and
nothing has been added to the lamentations over the ills brought by
the flight of years since Moses, the man of God,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
declared the concluding period of protracted life to be a period of labour and
sorrow;&mdash;since Solomon, or whoever else writes under the name of the
Preacher, in a passage which, whether it is inspired or not, is a passage
of exquisite beauty, warned us to provide in youth, "while the
evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say,
I have no pleasure in them; while the sun, or the light, or the moon,
or the stars be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: in
the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong
men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are
few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, and the
doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is
low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
of music shall be brought low; also when they shall be afraid of that
which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond-tree
shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burthen, and desire shall
fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about
the streets: or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be
broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken
at the cistern;"&mdash;or, to make a shorter quotation, since Homer summed
up all these ills by applying to old age the epithet of <b>&lambda;&nu;&gamma;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;</b>,&mdash;a
word which cannot be translated, but the force of which must be felt.
Abate these unavoidable misfortunes, and the catalogue of Jaques is
that of happy conditions. In his visions there is no trace of the child
doomed to wretchedness before its very birth; no hint that such a thing
could occur as its being made an object of calculation, one part
medical, three parts financial, to the starveling surgeon, whether by
the floating of the lungs, or other test equally fallacious and
fee-producing, the miserable mother may be convicted of doing that
which, before she had attempted, all that is her soul of woman must
have been torn from its uttermost roots, when in an agony of
shame and dread the child that was to have made her forget her
labour was committed to the cesspool. No hint that the days of infancy
should be devoted to the damnation of a factory, or to the tender
mercies of a parish beadle. No hint that philosophy should come
forward armed with the panoply offensive and defensive of logic and
eloquence, to prove that the inversion of all natural relations was
just and wise,&mdash;that the toil of childhood was due to the support
of manhood,&mdash;that those hours, the very labours of which even the
etymologists give to recreation, should be devoted to those wretched
drudgeries which seem to split the heart of all but those who derive
from them blood-stained money, or blood-bedabbled applause. Jaques
sees not Greensmith squeezing his children by the throat until they
die. He hears not the supplication of the hapless boy begging his
still more hapless father for a moment's respite, ere the fatal
handkerchief is twisted round his throat by the hand of him to whom he
owed his being. Jaques thinks not of the baby deserted on the step of the
inhospitable door, of the shame of the mother, of the disgrace of the
parents, of the misery of the forsaken infant. His boy is at school,
his soldier in the breach, his elder on the justice-seat. Are these
the woes of life? Is there no neglected creature left to himself or
to the worse nurture of others, whose trade it is to corrupt,&mdash;who will
teach him what was taught to swaggering Jack Chance, found on
Newgate steps, and educated at the venerable seminary of St. Giles's
Pound, where</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"They taught him to drink, and to thieve, and fight,</span>
<span class="i10">And everything else but to read and write."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Is there no stripling short of commons, but abundant in the supply of
the strap or the cudgel?&mdash;no man fighting through the world in
fortuneless struggles, and occupied by cares or oppressed by wants more
stringent than those of love?&mdash;or in love itself does the current of
that bitter passion never run less smooth than when sonnets to a
lady's eyebrow are the prime objects of solicitude?&mdash;or may not even
he who began with such sonneteering have found something more
serious and sad, something more heart-throbbing and soul-rending, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
the progress of his passion? Is the soldier melancholy in the storm
and whirlwind of war? Is the gallant confronting of the cannon a
matter to be complained of? The dolorous flight, the trampled battalion,
the broken squadron, the lost battle, the lingering wound, the
ill-furnished hospital, the unfed blockade, hunger and thirst, and pain,
and fatigue, and mutilation, and cold, and rout, and scorn, and
slight,&mdash;services neglected, unworthy claims preferred, life wasted,
or honour tarnished,&mdash;are all passed by! In peaceful life we have no deeper
misfortune placed before us than that it is not unusual that a justice
of peace may be prosy in remark and trite in illustration. Are there
no other evils to assail us through the agony of life? And when
the conclusion comes, how far less tragic is the portraiture of mental
imbecility, if considered as a state of misery than as one of comparative
happiness, as escaping a still worse lot! Crabbe is sadder far than
Jaques, when, after his appalling description of the inmates of a
workhouse,&mdash;(what would Crabbe have written <i>now</i>?)&mdash;he
winds up by showing to us amid its victims two persons as being</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">"<i>happier</i> far than they,</span>
<span class="i10">The moping idiot, and the madman gay."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">If what he here sums up as the result of his life's observations
on mankind be all that calls forth the melancholy of the witty and eloquent
speaker, he had not much to complain of. Mr. Shandy lamenting
in sweetly modulated periods, because his son has been
christened Tristram instead of Trismegistus, is as much an object of
condolence. Jaques has just seen the aspect of famine, and heard
the words of despair; the Duke has pointed out to him the consideration
that more woful and practical calamities exist than
even the exile of princes and the downfall of lords; and he breaks off
into a light strain of satire, fit only for jesting comedy. Trim might
have rebuked him as he rebuked the prostrate Mr. Shandy, by reminding
him that there are other things to make us melancholy in the world:
and nobody knew it better, or could say it better, than he in whose
brain was minted the hysteric passion of Lear choked by his button,&mdash;the
farewell of victorious Othello to all the pomp, pride, and circumstance
of glorious war,&mdash;the tears of Richard over the submission of
roan Barbary to Bolingbroke,&mdash;the demand of Romeo that the Mantuan
druggist should supply him with such soon-speeding gear that
will rid him of hated life</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"As violently as hasty powder fired</span>
<span class="i10">Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb,"&mdash;</span>
</div></div>

<p>the desolation of Antony,&mdash;the mourning of Henry over sire slain by
son, and son by sire,&mdash;or the despair of Macbeth. I say nothing of
the griefs of Constance, or Isabel, or Desdemona, or Juliet, or Ophelia,
because in the sketches of Jaques he passes by all allusion to
women; a fact which of itself is sufficient to prove that his melancholy
was but in play,&mdash;was nothing more than what Arthur remembered
when he was in France, where</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,</span>
<span class="i10">Only for wantonness."</span>

<p class="indent">Shakespeare well knew that there is no true pathetic, nothing
that can permanently lacerate the heart, and embitter the speech, unless
a woman be concerned. It is the legacy left us by Eve. The tenor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
of man's woe, says Milton, with a most ungallant and grisly pun, is
still from <i>wo</i>-man to begin; and he who will give himself a few moments
to reflect will find that the stern trigamist is right. On this,
however, I shall not dilate. I may perhaps have something to say, as
we go on, of the ladies of Shakspeare. For the present purpose, it is
enough to remark with Trim, that there are many real griefs to make
a man lie down and cry, without troubling ourselves with those which
are put forward by the poetic mourner in the forest of Arden.</p>

<p class="indent">Different indeed is the sight set before the eyes of Adam
in the great poem just referred to, when he is told to look upon the miseries
which the fall of man has entailed upon his descendants. Far other
than the scenes that flit across this melancholy man by profession are
those evoked by Michael in the visionary lazar-house. It would be
ill-befitting, indeed, that the merry note of the sweet bird warbling
freely in the glade should be marred by discordant sounds of woe,
cataloguing the dreary list of disease,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">"All maladies</span>
<span class="i10">Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms</span>
<span class="i10">Of heartsick agony, all feverous kinds,</span>
<span class="i10">Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs,</span>
<span class="i10">Intestine stone and ulcer, colic pangs,</span>
<span class="i10">Demoniac frenzy, moping melancholy,</span>
<span class="i10">Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence,</span>
<span class="i10">Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums;"</span>
</div></div>

<p>while, amid the dire tossing and deep groans of the sufferers,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"&mdash;&mdash; Despair</span>
<span class="i10">Tended the sick, busiest from couch to couch;</span>
<span class="i10">And over them triumphant Death his dart</span>
<span class="i10">Shook, but delayed to strike."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">And equally ill-befitting would be any serious allusion to
those passions and feelings which in their violence or their anguish render the
human bosom a lazar-house filled with maladies of the mind as racking
and as wasting as those of the body, and call forth a supplication
for the releasing blow of Death as the final hope, with an earnestness
as desperate, and cry as loud as ever arose from the tenement, sad,
noisome, and dark, which holds the joint-racked victims of physical
disease. Such themes should not sadden the festive banquet in the
forest. The Duke and his co-mates and partners in exile, reconciled
to their present mode of life, ["I would not change it," says Amiens,
speaking, we may suppose, the sentiments of all,] and successful in
having plucked the precious jewel, content, from the head of ugly
and venomous Adversity, are ready to bestow their woodland fare
upon real suffering, but in no mood to listen to the heart-rending
descriptions of sorrows graver than those which form a theme for the
discourses which Jaques in mimic melancholy contributes to their amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">Shakspeare designed him to be a maker of fine sentences,&mdash;a
dresser forth in sweet language of the ordinary common-places or
the common-place mishaps of mankind, and he takes care to show
us that he did not intend him for anything beside. With what admirable
art he is confronted with Touchstone. He enters merrily
laughing at the pointless philosophising of the fool in the forest. His
lungs crow like chanticleer when he hears him moralizing over his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
dial, and making the deep discovery that ten o'clock has succeeded
nine, and will be followed by eleven. When Touchstone himself appears,
we do not find in his own discourse any touches of such deep
contemplation. He is shrewd, sharp, worldly, witty, keen, gibing,
observant. It is plain that he has been mocking Jaques; and, as is
usual, the mocked thinks himself the mocker. If one has moralized
the spectacle of a wounded deer into a thousand similes, comparing
his weeping into the stream to the conduct of worldlings in giving in
their testaments the sum of more to that which had too much,&mdash;his
abandonment, to the parting of the flux of companions from misery,&mdash;the
sweeping by of the careless herd full of the pasture, to the desertion
of the poor and broken bankrupt by the fat and greasy citizens,&mdash;and
so forth; if such have been the common-places of Jaques, are
they not fitly matched by the common-places of Touchstone upon his
watch? It is as high a stretch of fancy that brings the reflection how</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"&mdash;&mdash; from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,</span>
<span class="i10">And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,</span>
<span class="i10">And thereby hangs a tale,"</span>
</div></div>

<p>which is scoffed at by Jaques, as that which dictates his own
moralizings on the death of the deer. The motley fool is as wise as the
melancholy lord whom he is parodying. The shepherd Corin, who
replies to the courtly quizzing of Touchstone by such apophthegms as
that "it is the property of rain to wet, and of fire to burn," is
unconsciously performing the same part to the clown, as <i>he</i> had
been designedly performing to Jaques. Witty nonsense is answered by
dull nonsense, as the emptiness of poetry had been answered by the
emptiness of prose. There was nothing sincere in the lamentation
over the wounded stag. It was only used as a peg on which to hang
fine concepts. Had Falstaff seen the deer, his imagination would
have called up visions of haunches and pasties, preluding an everlasting
series of cups of sack among the revel riot of boon companions,
and he would have instantly ordered its throat to be cut. If it had
fallen in the way of Friar Lawrence, the mild-hearted man of herbs
would have endeavoured to extract the arrow, heal the wound, and
let the hart ungalled go free. Neither would have thought the hairy
fool a subject for reflections, which neither relieved the wants of
man nor the pains of beast. Jaques complains of the injustice and
cruelty of killing deer, but unscrupulously sits down to dine upon
venison, and sorrows over the sufferings of the native burghers of the
forest city, without doing anything further than amusing himself with
rhetorical flourishes drawn from the contemplation of the pain which
he witnesses with professional coolness and unconcern.</p>

<p class="indent">It is evident, in short, that the happiest days of his life
are those which he is spending in the forest. His raking days are over, and he
is tired of city dissipation. He has shaken hands with the world,
finding, with Cowley, that "he and it would never agree." To use
an expression somewhat vulgar, he has had his fun for his money; and
he thinks the bargain so fair and conclusive on both sides, that he
has no notion of opening another. His mind is relieved of a thousand
anxieties which beset him in the court, and he breathes freely in the
forest. The iron has not entered into his soul; nothing has occurred
to chase sleep from his eyelids; and his fantastic reflections are, as
he himself takes care to tell us, but general observations on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
ordinary and outward manners and feelings of mankind,&mdash;a species of
taxing which</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"&mdash;&mdash; like a wild-goose flies,</span>
<span class="i10">Unclaim'd of any man."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Above all, in having abandoned station, and wealth, and country,
to join the faithful few who have in evil report clung manfully to
their prince, he knows that he has played a noble and an honourable
part; and they to whose lot it may have fallen to experience the happiness
of having done a generous, disinterested, or self-denying action,&mdash;or
sacrificed temporary interests to undying principle,&mdash;or shown to the
world without, that what are thought to be its great advantages can
be flung aside, or laid aside, when they come in collision with the
feelings and passions of the world within,&mdash;will be perfectly sure that
Jaques, reft of land, and banished from court, felt himself exalted in
his own eyes, and therefore easy of mind, whether he was mourning in
melodious blank verse, or weaving jocular parodies on the canzonets
of the good-humoured Amiens.</p>

<p class="indent">He was happy "under the greenwood tree." Addison I
believe it is who says, that all mankind have an instinctive love of country
and woodland scenery, and he traces it to a sort of dim recollection imprinted
upon us of our original haunt, the garden of Eden. It is at
all events certain, that, from the days when the cedars of Lebanon
supplied images to the great poets of Jerusalem, to that in which the
tall tree haunted Wordsworth "as a passion," the forest has caught a
strong hold of the poetic mind. It is with reluctance that I refrain
from quoting; but the passages of surpassing beauty which crowd
upon me from all times and languages are too numerous. I know not
which to exclude, and I have not room for all; let me then take a bit
of prose from one who never indulged in poetry, and I think I shall
make it a case in point. In a little book called "Statistical Sketches
of Upper Canada, for the use of Emigrants, by a Backwoodsman,"
now lying before me, the author, after describing the field-sports in
Canada with a precision and a <i>goût</i> to be derived only from practice
and zeal, concludes a chapter, most appropriately introduced by a
motto from the Lady of the Lake,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"'Tis merry, 'tis merry in good greenwood,</span>
<span class="i12">When the mavis and merle are singing,</span>
<span class="i10">When the deer sweep by, and the hounds are in cry,</span>
<span class="i12">And the hunter's horn is ringing,"</span>
</div></div>

<p>by saying,</p>

<p class="indent">"It is only since writing the above that I fell in with the
first volume of Moore's Life of Lord Edward Fitzgerald; and I cannot describe
the pleasure I received from reading his vivid, spirited, and
accurate description of the feelings he experienced on first taking on
him the life of a hunter. At an earlier period of life than Lord
Edward had then attained, I made my debut in the forest, and first
assumed the blanket-cloak and the rifle, the moccasin and the snowshoe;
and the ecstatic feeling of Arab-like independence, and the
utter contempt for the advantage and restrictions of civilization,
which he describes, I then felt in its fullest power. And even now,
when my way off life, like Macbeth's, is falling 'into the sere, the
yellow leaf,' and when a tropical climate, privation, disease, and
thankless toil are combining with advancing years to unstring a frame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
the strength of which once set hunger, cold, and fatigue at defiance,
and to undermine a constitution that once appeared iron-bound, still I
cannot lie down by a fire in the woods without the elevating feeling
which I experienced formerly returning, though in a diminished
degree. This must be human nature;&mdash;for it is an undoubted fact,
that no man who associates with and follows the pursuits of the Indian,
for any length of time, ever voluntarily returns to civilized society.</p>

<p class="indent">"What a companion in the woods Lord Edward must have
been! and how shocking to think that, with talents which would have made
him at once the idol and the ornament of his profession, and affections
which must have rendered him an object of adoration in all the
relations of private life,&mdash;with honour, with courage, with generosity,
with every unit that can at once ennoble and endear,&mdash;he should
never have been taught that there is a higher principle of action than
the mere impulse of the passions,&mdash;that he should never have learned,
before plunging his country into blood and disorder, to have weighed
the means he possessed with the end he proposed, or the problematical
good with the certain evil!&mdash;that he should have had Tom
Paine for a tutor in religion and politics, and Tom Moore for a
biographer, to hold up as a pattern, instead of warning, the errors and
misfortunes of a being so noble,&mdash;to subserve the revolutionary purposes
of a faction, who, like Samson, are pulling down a fabric which
will bury both them and their enemies under it."</p>

<p class="indent">Never mind the aberrations of Lord Edward Fitzgerald,
the religion or the politics of Tom Paine, or the biography of Tom Moore.
On all these matters I may hold my own opinions, but they are not wanted
now; but have we not here the feelings of Jaques? Here are the
gloomy expressions of general sorrow over climate, privation, disease,
thankless toil, advancing years, unstrung frame. But here also we
have ecstatic emotions of Arab-like independence, generous reflections
upon political adversaries, and high-minded adherence to the views
and principles which in his honour and conscience he believed to be
in all circumstances inflexibly right, coming from the heart of a
forest. The Backwoodsman is Dunlop; and is he, in spite of this
sad-sounding passage, melancholy? Not he, in good sooth. The
very next page to that which I have quoted is a description of the
pleasant mode of travelling in Canada, before the march of improvement
had made it comfortable and convenient.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Jaques was just as woe-begone as the Tyger, and no more.
I remember when he&mdash;Dunlop I mean, not Jaques&mdash;used to laugh
at the phrenologists of Edinburgh for saying, after a careful admeasurement,
that his skull in all points was exactly that of Shakspeare,&mdash;I suppose
he will be equally inclined to laugh when he finds who is the double
an old companion has selected for him. But no matter. His melancholy
passes away not more rapidly than that of Jaques; and I venture to say
that the latter, if he were existing in flesh and blood, would have no
scruple in joining the doctor this moment over the bowl of punch
which I am sure he is brewing, has brewed, or is about to brew, on
the banks of Huron or Ontario.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Whether he would or not, he departs from the stage
with the grace and easy elegance of a gentleman in heart and manners. He joins
his old antagonist the usurping Duke in his fallen fortunes; he had
spurned him in his prosperity: his restored friend he bequeaths to
his former honour, deserved by his patience and his virtue,&mdash;he
compliments Oliver on his restoration to his land, and love, and great
allies,&mdash;wishes Silvius joy of his long-sought and well-earned
marriage,&mdash;cracks upon Touchstone one of those good-humoured jests to which
men of the world on the eve of marriage must laughingly submit,&mdash;and
makes his bow. Same sage critics have discovered as a great
geographical fault in Shakspeare, that he introduces the tropical lion
and serpent into Arden, which, it appears, they have ascertained to
lie in some temperate zone. I wish them joy of their sagacity.
Monsters more wonderful are to be found in that forest; for never
yet, since water ran and tall tree bloomed, were there gathered together
such a company as those who compose the <i>dramatis personæ</i> of
"As You Like It." All the prodigies spawned by Africa, "<i>leonum
arida nutrix</i>," might well have teemed in a forest, wherever situate,
that was inhabited by such creatures as Rosalind, Touchstone, and Jaques.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="space-above1">&#8258;&emsp;As to the question which opened these
Papers,&mdash;why, I must leave it to the jury. Is the jesting, revelling, rioting
Falstaff, broken of fortunes, luckless in life, sunk in habits, buffeting with the
discreditable part of the world, or the melancholy, mourning,
complaining Jaques, honourable of conduct, high in moral position,
fearless of the future, and lying in the forest away from
trouble,&mdash;which of them, I say, feels more the load of care? I think
Shakspeare well knew, and depicted them accordingly. But I must leave
it to my readers, <i>si qui sunt</i>.</p>

<h2>THE ROMANCE OF A DAY.</h2>
<p class="f90">A PASSAGE IN THE LIFE OF AN ADVENTURER.</p>
<p class="f90 space-below1">WITH AN ILLUSTRATION BY GEORGE CRUIKSHANK.</p>

<p class="indent">When things are at the worst, they are sure to mend,
says the old adage; and the hero of the following narrative is a case in
point. Dick Diddler was a distant connexion, by the mother's side, of the
famous Jeremy, immortalized by Kenny. He was a shrewd, reckless
adventurer, gifted with an elastic conscience that would stretch like
Indian-rubber, and a genius for raising the wind unsurpassed by Æolus
himself. At the period to which this tale refers, he had dissipated
at the minor West-end hells, and elsewhere, the last farthing of a
pittance which he inherited from his father; and was considerably in
arrears with his landlady, a waspish gentlewoman who rented what
she complacently termed "an airy house" in the windiest quarter of
Camden Town. This was embarrassing; but Dick was not one to
despair. He had high animal spirits, knowledge of the world,
imperturbable self-possession, good exterior, plausible address, and
a modesty which he felt persuaded would never stand in the way of
his advancement.</p>

<p class="indent">Thousands of London adventurers, it has been observed,
rise in the morning without knowing how they shall provide a meal for the
day. Our hero was just now in this predicament, for he had not even the
means of procuring a breakfast. Something, however, must be done,
and that immediately, so he applied himself to a cracked bell which
stood on his ill-conditioned table; and, while waiting his landlady's
answer to the tintinnabulary summons, occupied himself by casting a
scrutinizing glance at his outer Adam. Alas! there was little here to
gratify the eye of taste and gentility! His coat was in that peculiar
state denominated "seedy," his linen was as yellow as a sea-sick
cockney, and his trousers evinced tokens of an antiquity better
qualified to inspire reverence than admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">Just as he had completed his survey, his landlady entered
the room, accompanied by her first-born,&mdash;a hopeful youth, with a fine
expanse of mouth calculated seriously to perplex a quartern loaf.
Dick perused her features attentively, and thought he had never before
seen her look so ugly. But this of course: Venus herself would
look a fright, if she came to dun for money.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, poppet, is that you?" exclaimed Dick, affectionately
patting the urchin's head, by way of an agreeable commencement to the
conversation; "Why, how the dear boy grows! Blessings on his pretty
face: he's the very image of his Ma!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, come, Mr. Diddler," replied Mrs. Dibbs, "that
language won't do no longer. You've been blessing little Tom twice a day
ever since you got into my books, but I'm not going to take out my
account in blessings. Blessings won't pay my milk-score, so I must
have my money,&mdash;and this very day too, for I've got a bill to make
up to-morrow."</p>

<p class="indent">"Have patience, my good lady, and all will be right."</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay, so you've said for the last month; but saying's one thing,
and doing's another."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very good."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"But it ain't very good; it's very bad."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, well, no matter, Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No matter! But I say it is a great matter,&mdash;a matter
of ten pounds fifteen shillings, to say nothing of them oysters what you did
me out on last night."</p>

<p class="indent">"Exactly so; and you shall have it all this very day, for
it so happens that I'm going into the City to receive payment of a debt
that has been owing me since November last. And this reminds me
that I have not yet breakfasted; so pray send up&mdash;now don't apologise,
for you could not possibly have known that I had an appointment
in Fenchurch-street at ten o'clock."</p>

<p class="indent">"Breakfast!" exclaimed Mrs. Dibbs with a disdainful toss
of her head; "no, no; not a mouthful shall you have till I get my money:
I'm quite sick of your promises."</p>

<p class="indent">"Nay, but my dear Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"It's no use argufying the pint; what I've said, I'll stand
to. Come, Tom&mdash;drat the boy! why don't you come?" and so saying, the
choleric dame, catching fast hold of her son by the pinafore, flounced
out of the room, banging the door after her with the emphasis of a hurricane.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick remained a few minutes behind, in the hope that
breakfast might yet be forthcoming: but finding that there was not the
slightest prospect of his landlady's relenting, he, in the true spirit of
an indignant Briton, consigned her "eyes" to perdition; and, having
thus expectorated his wrath, began to furbish up his faded apparel.
He tucked in his saffron shirt-collar; buttoned up his coat to the chin,
refreshing the white seams with the "Patent Reviver;" smoothed
round his silk hat, which luckily was in good preservation; and then
rushed out of the house with the desperate determination of breakfasting
at some one's expense. There is nothing like the gastric juice
to stimulate a man's ingenuity. It is the secret of half the poetic
inspiration in our literature.</p>

<p class="indent">Chance&mdash;or perhaps that ruling destiny which, do what
we will, still sways all our actions&mdash;led Dick's steps in the direction
of the Hampstead Road. It was a bright, cool, summer morning; the
housemaids were at work with their brooms outside the cottages;
the milkman was going his rounds with his "sky-blue;" and the
shiny porter-pots yet hung upon the garden rails. As our hero
moved onward, keeping his mouth close shut, lest the lively wind
might act too excitingly on his unfurnished epigastrum, his attentive
optics chanced to fall on a cottage, in the front parlour of which,
the window being open, he beheld a sight that roused all the shark
or alderman within him,&mdash;to wit, a breakfast set forth in a style
that might have created an appetite "under the ribs of death." Dick
stopped: the case was desperate; but his self-possession was equal
to the emergency. "A Mr. Smith lives here," said he, running his
eye hastily over the premises: "the bower, and the wooden god,
those trees so neatly clipped, and that commonplace-looking terrier
sleeping at the gate, with his nose poked through the rails, all betoken
the habits and fancies of a Smith. Good! I will favour the
gentleman with a call;" and with these words Dick gave a vehement
pull at the garden-bell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Is Mr. Smith at home?" he inquired with an air of easy assurance
that produced an instant effect on the girl who answered the bell.</p>

<p class="indent">"No, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Upon my life, that's very awkward; particularly
so as he requested me to be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! I suppose, then, you're the gentleman that was
expected here to breakfast this morning?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The very same, my dear."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," continued the girl, unlocking the gate, "master
desired me to say that you were to walk in, and not wait for him, for he
had to go into Tottenham-court Road on business, and should not be back
for an hour."</p>

<p class="indent">Dick took the hint, walked in,
and in an instant was hard at work.</p>

<p class="indent">How he punished the invigorating coffee! What havoc
he wrought among the eggs and French rolls! Never was seen such voracity
since the days of the ventripotent Heliogabalus. His expedition
was on a par with his prowess, for Mr. Smith's guest being momentarily
expected, he felt that he had not a moment to lose. Accordingly,
after doing prompt, impartial justice to every article on table,
he coolly rang the bell, and, without noticing the muttered "My
stars!" of the servant as she glanced at the wreck before her, he
desired her to tell Mr. Smith that, as he had a visit to pay in the
neighbourhood, he could not wait longer for him, but would call
again in the course of the day; and then, putting on his hat with
an air, he quitted the cottage on the best possible terms with himself
and all the world. There is nothing like good eating and drinking
to bring out the humanities.</p>

<p class="indent">Having no professional duties to attend to, Dick strolled
on to Hampstead Heath, where he seated himself on a bench that commands
an extensive view towards the west and north. Here he continued
musing upwards of an hour, in that buoyant mood which a
good breakfast never fails to call forth. It was early yet to trouble
himself about dinner or his landlady's bill; and Dick was not the
man to recognise a grievance till it stared him in the face, when, if
he could not give it the cut direct, he would boldly confront and
grapple with it: so he occupied himself with whistling one of Macheath's
songs in the Beggar's Opera.</p>

<p class="indent">While thus idling away his time, and picturing in his
mind's eye the perplexed visages of Mr. Smith and his guest when they should
become acquainted with the extent of their calamity, Dick's attention
was suddenly directed to the sound of voices near him. He listened;
and, from the dulcet accents in which the conversation was carried
on, felt persuaded that the parties were making love. Curious to
ascertain who they were, he retreated behind one of the broadest elms
on the terrace, and there beheld a dry old maid, thin as a thread-paper,
and straight as a stick of sealing-wax, smirking and affecting
to blush at something that was whispered in her ear by a young man.
Our adventurer fancied that the latter's person was familiar to him;
so, the instant the enamoured turtles separated, he emerged from his
hiding-place, and saw, advancing towards the bench he had just quitted,
an old com-rogue, to whom in his better days he had lost many
a sum at the gaming-table.</p>

<p class="indent">The recognition was mutual.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"What! Dick Diddler?"</p>

<p class="indent">"What! Sam Spragge?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, Sam, what has brought you here at this hour?" quoth our hero.</p>

<p class="indent">Samuel smiled, and pointed significantly towards the ancient virgin,
who was just then crossing the Heath, near the donkey-stand.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hem! I understand. Much property?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Eight hundred a year at her own disposal, and two thousand
<i>three per cents</i> at the death of a crusty, invalid brother-in-law,
who lives with her in that old-fashioned house she is now entering."</p>

<p class="indent">"Eight hundred a year!" said Dick musing; "lucky dog! And
how long have you known her?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! an eternity. Three days."</p>

<p class="indent">"And where did you pick her up?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Under a gateway in Camden Town, where we were both standing
up from the rain."</p>

<p class="indent">"You seem to have made excellent use of your time."</p>

<p class="indent">"Nothing easier. I could see at a glance that she was quite
as anxious for a husband as I am for a rich wife; so, after some indifferent
chat about the weather, &amp;c. I prevailed on her to accept of
my escort home; talked lots of sentiment as we jogged along under
my umbrella; praised her beauty to the skies,&mdash;for she is inordinately
vain, though ugly enough, as you must have seen, to scare a
ghost&mdash;and, in short, did not quit her till she had promised to meet
me on the following day."</p>

<p class="indent">"And she kept her word, no doubt?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I have now seen her four times, and am sure that if I
could but muster up funds enough for a Gretna-green trip,&mdash;for she has all
the romance of a boarding-school girl,&mdash;I could carry her off this
very night. But I cannot, Dick, I cannot;" and Sam heaved a sigh
that was quite pathetic.</p>

<p class="indent">"Can you not borrow of her?&mdash;'tis for her own good, you know."</p>

<p class="indent">"Impossible! I have represented myself as a man of substance;
and, were she once to suppose me otherwise, so quick-witted is she
on money matters, that she would instantly give me my dismissal."</p>

<p class="indent">"And what is your angel's name?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Priscilla Spriggins."</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear fellow," exclaimed Dick with a sudden burst of emotion,
"from my soul I pity you; but, alas! sympathy is all I have to offer:&mdash;look
here!" and, turning his empty pockets inside out, he displayed
two holes therein, about as big as the aperture of a mousetrap.</p>

<p class="indent">An expressive pause followed this touching exhibition; shortly
after which the two adventurers parted,&mdash;Sam returning towards London,
with a view, no doubt, of seeking, like Apollyon, "whom he
might devour;" and Dick remaining where he was, casting ever and
anon a glance towards the house where the fair Priscilla vegetated,
and meditating, the while, on the revelation that had just been made to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Tired at length of reverie, he rose from the bench, and made
his way back into Hampstead,&mdash;slowly, for every step was bringing him
nearer the residence of his unreasonable landlady. On passing down
by Mount Vernon, he beheld the walls on either side of him placarded
with hand-bills announcing that an auction was to take place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
that day at a large old family mansion (the by-streets of Hampstead
abound in such) close by: and, on moving towards the spot, he saw,
by the groups of people who were lounging at the open door, that
the sale had already begun. By way of killing an idle half-hour or
so, Dick entered; and, elbowing his way up stairs, soon found himself
in a spacious drawing-room, crowded with pictures, vases, old porcelain,
and other articles of <i>virtù</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Just at that moment the auctioneer put up a landscape painting
by one of the old masters, on which he expatiated with the customary
professional eloquence. "Going, ladies and gentlemen, going for two
hundred pounds&mdash;undoubted Paul Potter&mdash;highly admired by the late
lamented Lawrence&mdash;sheep so naturally coloured, you'd swear you
could hear 'em bleat&mdash;frame, too, in excellent
condition&mdash;going&mdash;going&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Two hundred and thirty!" said a small gentleman in spectacles,
raising himself on tip-toe to catch the auctioneer's eye.</p>

<p class="indent">"Two hundred and fifty" shouted another.</p>

<p class="indent">"Going for two hundred and fifty," said the man in the
rostrum; after a pause, "upon my word, ladies and gentlemen, this is giving
away the picture. Pray look at that fore-shortened old ram in the
background; why, his two horns alone are worth the money. Let me
beg, for the honour of art, that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Three hundred!" roared Dick, with an intrepid effrontery
that extorted universal respect,&mdash;for to his other amiable qualities he
added that of being a "brag" of the first water, and was proud, even
though it were but for a moment, of displaying his consequence among strangers.</p>

<p class="indent">As this was the highest bidding, the picture was knocked
down to our hero, who, having cracked his joke, and gratified his swaggering
propensities, was about to beat a retreat, when he found his elbow
twitched by a nervous, eager little man,&mdash;a duodecimo edition of a
virtuoso,&mdash;who had only that moment entered the room.</p>

<p class="indent">"So you have purchased that Paul Potter, sir, I understand,"
said the stranger, wiping the perspiration from his bald head, and evidently
struggling with his vexation.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick nodded an affirmative, not a little curious
to know what would come next.</p>

<p class="indent">"Bless my soul, how unlucky! To think that I should
have been only five minutes too late, and such a run as I had for it! Excuse
the liberty I am taking, but have you any wish to be off your bargain,
sir?&mdash;not that I am particularly anxious about the picture&mdash;I merely
ask for information; that's all, sir, I assure you," added the virtuoso,
aware that he had committed himself, and endeavouring to retrieve
his blunder.</p>

<p class="indent">Dick cast one of his most searching glances at the stranger;
and, reading in his countenance the anxiety he would fain have concealed
under a show of indifference, said in his slyest and most composed
manner, "May I beg to be favoured with your name, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Smithson, sir,&mdash;Richard Smithson, agent to Lord
Theodore Thickskull, whose picture-gallery I have the honour of a commission
to furnish; and happening to read a day or two ago in the "Times" that
a few old paintings were to be disposed of by auction here on the
premises, I thought, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Indeed! That alters the case," replied our hero with
an air of dignified courtesy, "for I have some slight acquaintance with his
lordship myself."</p>

<p class="indent">"Bless my soul, how odd!&mdash;how uncommon odd! Possibly,
then, for my lord's sake, you will not object to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"No," replied Dick smiling, "I did not say that."</p>

<p class="indent">"Rely on it, sir," continued the fidgety little virtuoso,
"you are mistaken in your estimate of that painting. They say it is a Paul
Potter; but it's no such thing&mdash;no such thing, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then why are you so anxious to get possession of it?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Who? I, sir? Bless my soul, I'm not anxious. I merely
thought that as his lordship was particularly partial to landscapes, he might
be tempted, perhaps, to give more&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Well," said Dick, eager to bring the matter to a conclusion,
"as I have no very pressing desire to retain the picture, though it is the
very thing for my library in Mount-street, you shall have it; but on certain conditions."</p>

<p class="indent">"Name them, my dear sir, name them," said the virtuoso, his
eyes sparkling with animation.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have bought the painting," resumed Dick, "for three hundred
guineas; now, you shall have it for six hundred. You see I put the
matter quite on a footing of business, without the slightest reference
to his lordship."</p>

<p class="indent">"Six hundred guineas! Bless my soul, impossible!"</p>

<p class="indent">"As you please," replied our hero with exquisite nonchalance; "I
am indifferent about the matter."</p>

<p class="indent">"Say four hundred, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not a farthing less. The pictures in this house, as the
advertisement which brought me up here at this unseasonable hour, before I
had even time to complete my toilette, justly observes, have been
long celebrated, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'll give you five hundred," replied Smithson,
cutting short Dick's remarks.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, well, for his lordship's sake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Good!" exclaimed the virtuoso; and hurrying Dick to
a more quiet corner of the room, he took out pen and inkhorn, wrote a
check on a West-end banker for the amount of the balance, thrust it
into his hand, and then, after assuring him that he would arrange
everything with the auctioneer, and would not trouble him to stay
longer, hurried away towards the rostrum, as though he feared our
hero would repent the transfer of a painting for which he himself
imagined he should be able to screw about eight hundred pounds
out of his lordship, who was remarkable for the readiness with which
he paid through the nose.</p>

<p class="indent">No sooner had Dick lost sight of Mr. Smithson, than
away he flew from the house, bounding and taking big leaps like a ram,
till he reached the main street, when, changing his exultant pace for a
more sober and gentlemanlike one, he hailed the Hampstead coach,
which was about leaving the office, snugly ensconced himself inside,
and within the hour was deposited at Charing-cross.</p>

<p class="indent">"Coachman," quoth our hero, as the Jehu, having descended
from his box, held out his hand to receive the usual fare, "I am rather delicately situated."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Humph!" replied the man, who seemed perfectly to
comprehend, though not to sympathise with, the delicacy of the case, "sorry
for it; but master always says, says he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"The fact is," continued Dick, interrupting what bade fair
to become a prolix Philippic, "though I have not a farthing in my pocket,
having forgotten to take out my purse this morning, yet as I am just
going to receive cash for a two hundred pound cheque, and shall return
with you to Hampstead, I presume the delay of an hour will
make no great difference."</p>

<p class="indent">The coachman, whose white round face usually beamed
with all the bland expression of a turnip, evinced symptoms of an uneasy distrust
at this speech; but when Dick exhibited the cheque&mdash;not relishing
the idea of a "bolt," long experience having no doubt taught him
that coachmen running after a fare are apt to run with most inconvenient
velocity&mdash;when, I say, Dick exhibited this convincing scrap
of paper, all Jehu&#8217;s suspicions vanished, and, touching the shining
edge of his hat, he absolved our hero from extempore payment, with
a bow that might have done honour to a Margate dancing-master.</p>

<p class="indent">This knotty point settled, the ingenious Richard next posted off in a
cab to the banker's,&mdash;for it was beneath his dignity to walk,&mdash;presented
his cheque, received the amount, placed it securely in his
waistcoat pocket, and then made all possible haste to a well-known
shop in the neighbourhood of Piccadilly, where every item necessary
to perfect the man of fashion may be procured at a minute&#8217;s notice.</p>

<p class="indent">Our hero entered the shop in a condition bordering upon the
shabby genteel, though his person and address were a handsome set-off
against the infirmities of his apparel: he came out dressed in the
very height of ton. The hue of his linen was unimpeachable; his
pantaloons fitted to a miracle; his coat was guiltless of a wrinkle.
Then his gay, glossy silk waistcoat, to say nothing of&mdash;but enough;
the metamorphosis was complete&mdash;the snake had cast its skin&mdash;the
grub was transformed into the butterfly.</p>

<p class="indent">But, startling as was the change which his Hampstead
speculation had wrought in his person, still more so was its effect on his
mind. Here an entire revolution was already in full activity. Vast ideas
fermented in his brain. He no longer crept along with the downcast
look of an adventurer, but stared boldly about him, as one conscious
that he was somebody. And so he was. It is not every one who
cuts a figure at the West-end that can boast of the possession of two
hundred pounds!</p>

<p class="indent">On his road back to Charing-cross, the first object which caught
our hero&#8217;s eye was the Hampstead coach preparing to set out on its
return. The sight brought to his recollection the fair Priscilla Spriggins;
and in an instant, with the decision of a Napoleon, he resolved
to make a "Bold Stroke for a Wife," and carry her of to Gretna that
very night. The scheme was hopeless, you will say: granted; but
Dick was formed to vanquish, not be vanquished by, circumstances.
"Faint heart never won fair lady," said he; "so here goes;" and in he popped.</p>

<p class="indent">It was now about two o'clock, the hour when the fair
inhabitants of our cockney Arcadia are in the habit of taking the air on
the Heath, some with work-bags, some with the "last new novel," but
the majority with "Bentley's Miscellany" in their hands. Dick no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
sooner reached the donkey-stand, than he seated himself on a bench
close by,&mdash;where two young ladies were standing, fondly imagining
that they beheld Windsor Castle through a spyglass,&mdash;and looked
anxiously about him, to see if he could detect Miss Spriggins among
the peripatetics. But no Priscilla was visible. How, therefore,
should he act? "Wait," said common sense; so Dick waited.</p>

<p class="indent">Half an hour had elapsed, and he was beginning to get
impatient, when suddenly, on casting his eyes towards the lady's house, he
saw the door open, and Miss Spriggins herself stepped forth, with a novel
in one hand, and a pea-green parasol in the other. Dick watched her
motions as a cat watches a mouse: saw her steal away towards a retired
quarter of the Heath, and, having made up his mind as to the
line of conduct he should pursue, started from his seat and followed
quickly in her wake.</p>

<p class="indent">On reaching her side, "Miss Spriggins, I presume?"
said he with a profound obeisance.</p>

<p class="indent">"The same, sir," replied the surprised Priscilla.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! madam," resumed Dick, bursting at once into a
sentimental vein, for he felt that every minute was precious, "happy am I
to see that enchanting face once more."</p>

<p class="indent">"Excuse me, sir," said Miss Spriggins, affecting to bridle
up; "but really I do not comprehend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Comprehend, madam!&mdash;and how should you? I scarcely
comprehend myself. But how should it be otherwise, when for weeks past
I have daily wandered over this romantic heath, hoping, but, alas!
in vain, to catch one stray gleam of that sunny beauty which last
April&mdash;how well I remember the date!&mdash;so riveted my fancy as it
flashed on me from the front drawing-room of yonder house;" and
Dick pointed towards Priscilla's dwelling.</p>

<p class="indent">"Really, sir, this language&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Is the language of frenzy, maybe; but it is the language
also of passion. Ah! madam, if you but knew the flame that that one casual
glimpse of your bewitching countenance lit up in my unhappy
heart, you would pity what I now feel. Would to God that you were
as much a stranger to me as I am to you, for then I should cease to
be the wretch I am;" and Dick, having no onion ready, turned away
his head, and covered his face with his handkerchief.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sir," replied Miss Spriggins, startled, yet far from displeased,
"I really know not what answer to make to this most extraordinary&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Extraordinary, madam? Is it extraordinary to admire beauty&mdash;to
reverence perfection&mdash;to live but in the hope of again seeing her
who, once seen, can never be forgotten&mdash;is this extraordinary? If
so, then am I the most extraordinary of men. Revered Priscilla,&mdash;Miss
Spriggins, I should say,&mdash;your beauty has undone me. I should
have joined my regiment at Carlisle ere now; but you, and you only,
have kept me lingering in this sylvan district. Ah, lady! Captain
Felix O'Flam was happy till he saw you,&mdash;happy, even though deceived
by one whom he once thought his friend."</p>

<p class="indent">The fair Priscilla, whose predominant infirmity, as has been
before observed, was an indigestion of celibacy, could not witness the affliction
of the dashing young man before her, without sympathising with
him; perceiving which, Dick continued, "I see you pity me, lady,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
and your pity would be still more profound did you know all. It is
no later than last week that I became acquainted with the arts of an
adventurer named Spragge, who, for months previously, having wormed
himself into my confidence, had led me to believe that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Spragge!" interrupted Miss Spriggins with a look of huge
dismay; "and pray what sort of a person may he have been?"</p>

<p class="indent">In reply, Dick described Sam to the life; whereupon
his companion, no longer able to conceal her rage, exclaimed abruptly,
"The wretch!&mdash;what an escape have I had!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Escape, madam! How so? Has the villain dared to deceive
you, as he has me? I know that he is one of those plausible, unprincipled
adventurers about town, who make a point of preying on the
unwary&mdash;and such he must have considered me, when he introduced
himself one morning as a relation of the commanding officer of my
regiment;&mdash;but that he should have presumed to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh no, captain," replied Miss Spriggins with evident
embarrassment; "I was never his dupe. He merely called,&mdash;if indeed it be the
same person, as I feel convinced it is,&mdash;one day last week at my brother's,
on some pretence or other, which&mdash;which&mdash;But I have done
with him, the monster!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Call on you, madam!" replied Dick, adroitly giving in to the
lady's little deviation from fact, "call on you, when <i>I</i> dared not approach
your threshold! But enough&mdash;I'll cut his throat!"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no, captain; believe me, he is unworthy of your revenge."</p>

<p class="indent">"You say right, madam; for, since I have found reason to
suspect him, I have instituted inquiries into his character, and am told that
he is beneath contempt. Why&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;the fellow has
been twice ducked in a horse-pond, for thimble-rigging, at Epsom,&mdash;flogged
at the cart's tail for petty larceny, rubbed down with vinegar
and set in the black-hole to dry."</p>

<p class="indent">"Mercy on us! you don't say so?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Fact. But to quit this unworthy theme, and revert to a more
pleasing one:&mdash;May I, lady,"&mdash;and Dick here put on his most wheedling
air,&mdash;"may, I, having at length been honoured with one interview
with you, presume to hope for a second? Say only that we may
again meet,&mdash;nay, that this very evening we may take a stroll together
through these sequestered shades,&mdash;and make me the happiest of
men. Alas! I once thought that fortune alone was necessary to constitute
felicity; but, now that I have <i>that</i>, I feel 'tis as nothing; and
that love,&mdash;disinterested, impassioned love,&mdash;is the main ingredient
in the cup of human bliss. Give me but the woman I adore, and I
ask&mdash;I expect nothing further; but wealth without her is a mere
mockery."</p>

<p class="indent">This rhapsody had more effect on his companion than anything
Dick had yet said. It was a shot between wind and water.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, captain!" replied Priscilla, "I appreciate your
generous sentiments; and, to convince you that I am not unworthy to share them,
will&mdash;however strange it may appear in a young and timid female&mdash;consent
to see you once more. But, remember, it must be our last
interview;" and she sighed,&mdash;and so did Dick.</p>

<p class="indent">"Adieu, then, idol of my soul! if so I may presume to call
you," exclaimed this ingenuous young man; "adieu, till the shades of twilight
lengthen along the horse-pond hard by the donkey-stand, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
we will meet again, and the thrice-blessed Felix&mdash;&mdash;" Dick stopped:
seized the lady's hand, which she faintly struggled to withdraw; imprinted
on it a kiss that "came twanging off," as Massinger would
say; and then tore himself away, as if fearful of trusting himself with
farther speech.</p>

<p class="indent">On quitting Priscilla's side, Dick rattled across the fields
to Highgate, wondering at the success that had thus far crowned his efforts.
"Will she keep her appointment?" said he. "Yes, yes; I see it in
her eye. The 'captain' has done the business; never was there so
conceited an old lass!" and, thus soliloquizing, he found himself at the
door of the best hotel in Highgate, strutted into the coffee-room, and
rang the bell for the waiter.</p>

<p class="indent">The man answered his summons, cast a shrewd glance
at his exterior, and, satisfied with the scrutiny, made a low bow,
prefaced by a semicircular flourish of his napkin.</p>

<p class="indent">"Waiter," said Dick, with the air of a prince, "show me
into a private room, and let it be your best."</p>

<p class="indent">"Please to follow me, sir," replied the man; and, so saying,
he ushered our hero into a spacious apartment, which commanded a picturesque
view of a brick-field, with a pig-sty in the background.</p>

<p class="indent">"Good!" said Dick, and throwing himself full-length on a
sofa, he ordered an early dinner, cold, but of the best quality, together with
one bottle of madeira, and another of port, by way of appendix.</p>

<p class="indent">Well; the dinner came, wine ditto, and both were excellent.
Glass after glass was filled and emptied, and Dick felt his spirits mounting
into the seventh heaven of enjoyment. His thoughts were winged;
his prospects radiant with the sunny hues of hope. The fair Priscilla
was his own,&mdash;his grievances were at an end,&mdash;and he henceforth
could snap his fingers at fate. Happy man!</p>

<p class="indent">Having despatched his madeira, and two or three supplementary
glasses of port, so that one bottle might not be jealous of the attentions
paid to the other, Dick summoned the waiter into his presence,
paid his bill like a lord, and concluded by ordering a post-chaise and
four to be ready for him within two hours in a certain lane which he
specified, and which led off the high-road a few yards beyond the
turnpike. Of course the man understood the drift of this order.
Dick, however, took no notice of his knowing simper; but, telling him
that he should return in a short time, stalked from the hotel as if the
majesty of England were centred in his person.</p>

<p class="indent">On returning to the Heath, he found, as he had expected,
the fair Priscilla awaiting his advent by the horse-pond. She received him
with a blush, to which he replied by a squeeze; and then, emboldened
by the wine he had drunk, went on in a strain of high-flown panegyric
which rapidly thawed the heart of the too susceptible Miss
Spriggins. Dick was not the lad to do things by halves. Neck or nothing
was his motto; and accordingly, before he had been ten minutes
in company with his fair one, he had succeeded in drawing from her
a confession that she preferred him to all the suitors she had ever
had. This point gained, our hero adroitly changed the conversation;
talked of his prospects when his father's estates in the North should
come into his possession; of his friend Lord Theodore Thickskull, to
whom he should be so proud to introduce his Priscilla; and of his intention
to sell out of the army the instant she consented to be his.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Thus chatting, Dick&mdash;accidentally, to all appearance&mdash;drew
his companion on towards Highgate, when, suddenly putting on a look of
extreme wonder, he exclaimed, "Who'd have thought it! We are
close by the Tunnel. Ah! dearest Priscilla, you see how time flies
when we are with those we love! And, now that you are here, my
angel, you cannot surely refuse to honour my hotel with your presence.
Nay, not a word; it is hard by, and I am sure you must be fatigued after your walk."</p>

<p class="indent">The lady protested that she could not think of entering an
hotel with a single man. She did, however; and was so favourably impressed
with the respect shown to Dick by the waiter, who with his
finger beside his nose implied that all was ready, that had she ever
harboured distrust, this circumstance alone would have effectually
banished it from her mind.</p>

<p class="indent">No sooner had the parties entered Dick's private
apartment, than, strange to tell, they beheld a bottle of port wine standing
on the table. And, lo! there also were two glasses! Of course our hero
could not but present one to Priscilla, who received it, nothing loth,
though affecting extreme coyness. Its effects were soon visible. Her
bleak blue nose assumed a faint mulberry tinge, her eyes sparkled,
and she simpered, languished, and ogled Dick, sighing the while, with
a sort of die-away sensibility, intended to show the extreme tenderness
of her nature. These blandishments, which our hero returned
with compound interest, were, however, soon put an end to, by the
lady's suddenly rising, and requesting him to <i>chaperon</i> her home, as
it was getting late, and her brother would be uneasy at her absence.
Dick complied, though with apparent reluctance, and, as he passed
through the hall with Priscilla hanging on his arm, he could see the
landlady peeping at him through the yellow gauze blinds of the tap-room window.</p>

<p class="indent">It was now confirmed twilight; the dicky-birds were
asleep in their nests; the Highgate toll-bar looked vague and spectral in the
gloom; and nought disturbed the solemn silence of the hour, save the
pot-boys calling "Beer!" at the cottages by the road-side. As Dick
rambled on, under the pretence of leading Miss Spriggins by a short
cut home, his thoughts took the hue of the season, and he became
pensive and abstracted. He looked at Priscilla, and sighed; while she
reciprocated the respiration, heaving up from the depths of her &oelig;sophagus
a sigh that might have upset a schooner. And thus the enamoured
pair pursued their walk, Dick every now and then squeezing
his companion's hand with the gentle compression of a blacksmith's
vice. 'Twas a spectacle gratifying to a benevolent heart, the sight of
those devoted lovers, so wrapt up in each other as to be regardless of
the extraordinary beauties of the picturesque scenery about them.
The dog-rose bloomed in the hedge, but they inhaled not its fragrance.
The ducks quacked in the verdant ditch beside their path,
but they heeded not their euphonious ejaculations. Their own sweet
thoughts were enough for them. Surrounding nature was as nought,&mdash;they
seemed alone in creation,&mdash;the sole denizens of Middlesex!</p>

<p class="indent">By this time the moon had climbed the azure vault of
heaven; the last Omnibus had set down the last man; when lo! before he
was aware of his contiguity, Dick found himself close by the turnpike.
'Twas a critical moment; but the young man was desperate, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
desperation knows no impossibilities. Changing the sentimental tone he
had hitherto adopted, he burst into the most frenzied exclamations of
grief; stated the necessity he was under of immediately joining his
regiment at Carlisle, which he should have done long before had not
his love for Priscilla kept him lingering in the vicinity of Hampstead;
that he had not the heart to state this before; but, now that he had
explained his situation, he felt that he should not survive the shock of
a separation. "There," said he, pointing to the carriage, which was
but a few yards off, "there is the detested vehicle destined to bear
me far from thee! Why had I not the candour to explain my position
till this moment? Alas! who, situated as I am, could have
acted otherwise? Lady, I love&mdash;adore&mdash;doat&mdash;on you to
distraction! Let us fly, then, and link our fates together. You speak not, alas!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Good Heavens!" replied the bewildered Miss Spriggins,
"impossible! What would the world say? Oh fie, Captain Felix!&mdash;to think
that I should have been exposed to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, Priscilla,&mdash;my Priscilla,&mdash;and let us hasten
to be happy. The respected clergyman at Gretna&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"An elopement!&mdash;Monstrous!&mdash;Oh! that I should
have lived to hear such a proposition!"</p>

<p class="indent">Need the sequel be insisted on? Dick wept, prayed,
capered, tore his hair, and acted a thousand shrewd extravagances; swore he
would hang himself to the toll-bar, or cut his throat with an oyster-knife,
if his own dear Priscilla did not consent to unite her destiny
with his; and, in fact, so worked upon the damsel's sensibilities, that
she had no help for it but to gasp forth a reluctant consent. An instant,
and all was ready for departure. Crack went the whip, round
went the wheels, and away went the fond couple to Gretna-green,
rattling along the high north road at the rate of fourteen miles an hour!</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Thus he who at nine o'clock in the morning was an
adventurer without a sixpence in his pocket, by the same hour in the evening
was a gentleman in possession of a woman worth eight hundred pounds <i>per
annum</i>!&mdash;Gentle reader, truth is strange,&mdash;stranger than fiction.</p>

<h2>THE MINISTER'S FATE.</h2>
<p class="f90 space-below1">A SKETCH OF THE PAST.</p>

<p class="indent">Now that the session of parliament is fairly set in, and
occupying public attention, sketches and recollections of public orators, with
touches at the gallery M.P.'s, or "gentlemen of the fourth estate,"
as the reporters have been termed, will of course become redundant;
but for scribblers who have known St. Stephen's only a session or
two to attempt a thing of this sort, so as to satisfy those who take
a real interest in the doings of the senate, is out of the question.
To deal with such matters properly, a man, as Pierce Egan says
of the important mysteries of boxing and slang, "must be brought
up to the business from a <i>young 'un</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">It is not my purpose to deal with matters of the day. My
sketches might go a quarter, or probably half a century back: Graham's
celestial bed, Mr. Dodd's execution, and Lord George Gordon's riots, will
scarcely be out of my reach. Though I set off with what relates to
the House of Commons, from having known many of the distinguished
writers who have at various periods laboured there, other scenes will
occasionally recur to me, which it may be worth while to bring,
with the details none but an eyewitness can give, before the reader.</p>

<p class="indent">I did not, however, know, but from reading of them in
the newspapers, the parliamentary orators of my time, till after the opening
of the present century. The last stars of a galaxy admitted to be of
more than ordinary splendour, had not yet faded when I made my
debut in the gallery of St. Stephen's Chapel: Pitt and Fox, Lord
North and Burke, had "shuffled off this mortal coil;" but Wyndham,
and Sheridan, and Tierney remained. Of them and of their latter
contemporaries I have many recollections; some of which, as they are
connected with matters of historical interest, it may be entertaining
at least, to recall. It will not be important to observe strict
chronological order, so each scene is kept by itself, the colouring not
exaggerated and every fact related with a scrupulous regard to sacred truth.</p>

<p class="indent">Shades of the departed, how ye rise to "my mind's eye"
as I prepare to enter on my task! On the right, as we looked from the gallery
of the old House, that is, to the left of the Speaker's chair, I see
Ponsonby, with his portly form, white hair, and red chubby countenance;
Wyndham, a tall, spare figure, and a head partially bald;
Tierney, with his lowering brow, apparently waiting to spring on his
ministerial victim; Sheridan, exhibiting an aspect but too indicative
of the thoughtless career he pursued; Romilly, maintaining an air of
solemn dignity, with an appearance of exhaustion from severe mental
toil; Whitbread, robust, shrewd, and never weary; his deportment
might have passed for that of a blunt, resolute farmer. Always at his
post; during the session, the House of Commons was his home.
Opposed to these I see the keen, sarcastic, and animated Perceval.
He had a bright penetrating eye, and a nose rather inclining upwards,
which the H. B.'s of 1807 converted into a most ludicrous pug nose;
his figure was small, and he had little hair on the crown of his head;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
but he wore a long thin queue behind, which in debate, from the vivacity
of his manner, was continually showing itself over one or other
shoulder. Near him sat Castlereagh. He boasted an elegant figure
and handsome countenance, and often carried the polish of the drawing-room
into the tumult of political warfare, but sometimes abruptly
dropped it, to strike the table or the box before him with almost
farcical violence. The capacious forehead and fine features of Canning
were generally by his side. The well-powdered head of Old
George Rose was seldom very distant, and the bald shining skull of
"Brother Bragge," as Mr. Bragge Bathurst had been facetiously
called by Canning, was one of the group.</p>

<p class="indent">Memory now turns to the gentlemen up-stairs in the
gallery; nor ought these to be thought beneath some notice, remembering
how many have since descended into the House to furnish occupation to
their reporting posterity. Woodfall formerly sat at the right hand
corner of the front of the gallery, on the seat which was what a goose
is for a meal, "too much for one, but too little for two,"&mdash;I mean the
continuation of the member's bench. He commonly held a gold-headed
cane in his hand, which he continually turned round one way
when listening to a speech, and then caused it to revolve the other
way attending to the reply. The smiling suavity of Hogan, the dry
good-humour of Donovan, (these gentlemen went out chief justice
and judge advocate to Sierra Leone, where they died,) the severe
glance of Keating, the gracious swagger and laugh of Edward Quin,
the "amiable obliquity of vision" of Peter Finnerty, the ardent
gaiety of Power, and the overflowing merriment of the senior Dowling,
all seem to return, with the peculiarities of many others, who,
like them, are no more, and those of a much greater number who
fortunately survive.</p>

<p class="indent">The consequences of a war of unexampled length were
severely felt in 1812, and much of the distress which then prevailed was
affirmed to have been produced by our own "orders in council," issued to
meet the decrees of Bonaparte. Earl Grey was their strenuous and
persevering opponent. A parliamentary inquiry into their operation
was instituted. In the Commons Mr. Whitbread greatly exerted
himself in support of the views of his noble friend Earl Grey, and
the investigation was entered upon by the whole House in committee.
The interminable examinations which followed, exhausted
public curiosity to such a pitch, that the gentlemen of the press had
instructions not to report them. In consequence of this, when the
order of the day was moved for going into the committee, they
closed their books, entered into conversation, and sometimes even
left the House.</p>

<p class="indent">The gallery was at that time on such occasions nearly
deserted; two or three reporters indolently reclining on their seats, and from
twelve to twenty visitors were all the audience the subject commanded.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the last-mentioned individuals, some few, from their own
interests being affected by the matter under inquiry, went to the house frequently
enough to get in some degree acquainted with the writers;
and among them was one gentleman who usually took his place on the
back seat, though he was always ready to resign it to those who, as
they went there for business, and not for pleasure, considered that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
had a right to claim it as their own. There was something singular in
this person's manner; and the eagerness with which he surveyed the
members, by means of an opera-glass, often excited the mirth of his
waggish neighbours. He asked many questions, but timed them so
well, and always deported himself with so much respectful good-humour,
that any information he desired was readily given.</p>

<p class="indent">One fine summer's afternoon I and some other tired
visitors to the House availed ourselves of the leisure which the sitting of
the committee afforded, to enjoy a walk on the banks of the river.
On our return, near Milbank, a person who had some knowledge
of us inquired if we had heard that a duel had taken place between
the Earl of Liverpool and Mr. Perceval, in which the latter
had fallen. We laughed at the improbability of the story, but were
seriously assured that we should find it true. Still incredulous, we
said we would soon ascertain the fact, and accordingly advanced to
Palace Yard. There the closed gates, the crowd assembled outside,
and the information communicated by a thousand tongues, soon
placed it beyond all doubt that the minister was no more, having
within the last hour been shot, not by his noble colleague, but
by a stranger named Bellingham.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Perceval was in the habit of coming down to the
House about five o'clock. On this day it was a quarter past that hour, when,
as he entered the lobby, he was shot through the heart. He staggered
a few paces, fell against one of the pillars, and almost immediately
expired. The assassin was instantly seized and taken to the bar of
the House, where a crowd of persons, members and strangers mixed in
extreme confusion, assembled round him; and as soon as an attempt
at restoring order could be made, the Speaker directed Mr. Whitbread
and other members to precede and follow the prisoner to a
place of safe custody. This was done, and these facts were generally
known to the multitude, which now beset all the avenue leading
to the two Houses.</p>

<p class="indent">From mouth to mouth the mournful tidings flew with
unexampled rapidity. The very prominent situation in which Mr. Perceval
stood, the active and important business he was daily seen engaged in, made
men almost seem to doubt if it were possible that such a career could
so suddenly be closed for ever. The rumours sent forth had the
same effect on every one they reached, I might almost say, that it
has been shown they had on me and my companions. All who heard
that the right honourable gentleman was dead, seemed to determine
instantly to verify the fact by repairing to Westminster. It was
about a quarter past five in the afternoon of the 11th of May that
Mr. Perceval was shot in the lobby of the House, and, by six, countless
thousands poured down the Strand and all the streets leading to
Charing Cross. Second editions of the evening papers were got out
with astonishing expedition; and, by the time I have mentioned, one
had been carried so far towards Westminster as the end of
Parliament-street, opposite Downing-street. The extreme eagerness of
every one to know all that could be known, I remember, instantly
got a crowd round the bearer of it. Ownership and ceremony were
not thought of: every one who could get hold of the much-coveted
broad sheet, considered that he had a right to it. I, among a host of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
intruders, saw there, in the manner described, the first connected
detail of the catastrophe.</p>

<p class="indent">As the night closed in, the crowd became immense, and
some discreditable exultation was expressed by the lowest of the mob; but
the general feeling created was that of humane commiseration and
unmitigated horror.</p>

<p class="indent">Admiring the great talents of Mr. Perceval as I did, and
impressed with a conviction that he was most amiable in private life, my
own sorrow was great; and I rejoiced at the thought that the murderer
was in safe custody, and would possibly, (as the sessions were about
to commence,) before a single week should have elapsed, suffer the
last penalty of the law.</p>

<p class="indent">Never shall I forget the spectacle which the House of
Commons presented on the following day. Those who have been in the habit
of going there, must have noticed with some annoyance the ceaseless
murmur which prevails for the first hour, or hour and a half, after the
Speaker has taken the chair, while private bills and petitions of little
interest, are being disposed of, and papers presented at the bar. The
monotonous repetition by the Speaker of the words, "So many as are
of that opinion say '<i>aye</i>,' those who are of a contrary opinion say '<i>no</i>;'
the ayes have it," on putting questions which are unopposed,&mdash;the
ceaseless slamming of doors,&mdash;the creaking of shoes of some of those
members who seem to delight in displaying their elegance by marching,
or I might almost say by skating, up and down the body of the
House, as if to let their friends, the strangers in and under the gallery,
see how very grand it is possible for them to look,&mdash;and the frequent
cry of "Order! order!" "Bar! bar!" from the Chair, given
forth, as was then the case, with full-toned dignity of Mr. Speaker
Abbot (the late Lord Colchester), altogether gave the idea of a careless,
irregular assembly,&mdash;of anything but a place where the most
important business of a great nation was to be transacted. Such was
its usual aspect in those days; but on the 12th of May 1812, most
widely different I found the scene. The attendance was unusually
full, but solemn funereal stillness marked the approach of each member
to assist in the proceedings growing out of the recent and melancholy
fate of the minister.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 6em;">"How silent did his old companions tread"</p>

<p>on that floor over which they had so long been accustomed
to pass with him whose fall they now lamented! Party feeling was annihilated;
all mourned, and many wept, for the deceased, as if he had
been their nearest, dearest friend or relative. A place on the ministerial
bench was pointed at from the gallery as that which Mr. Perceval
had been used to fill. I am not aware, though he generally
sat nearly in the same place, that any precise spot was particularly
reserved for him; and on the occasion which it is my object to recall,
certainly no such theatrical effort at effect was made. The vacant
seat was soon occupied by one of the late right honourable gentleman's colleagues.</p>

<p class="indent">Not only was there the abstinence from conversation, which
I have noted, but action&mdash;the common ordinary motions of gentlemen meeting
in assembly were suspended. The benches were filled with unwonted
regularity; and their occupants, scarcely venturing on a whisper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
and hardly changing their position, seemed almost like breathing
statues, while they awaited with awful interest the announcement of
what steps the government proposed to take, and what information
had been obtained by them respecting the event which had deprived
the administration of its chief.</p>

<p class="indent">The silence which prevailed was at length broken by the
Speaker, who, with an effort at firmness, but in a tone somewhat subdued,
pronounced the name of Lord Castlereagh, (the Late Marquis of Londonderry,)
who had at that moment presented himself at the bar.</p>

<p class="indent">His lordship, in a faltering voice, stated that he was the bearer of
a message from the Prince Regent.</p>

<p class="indent">"Please to bring it up," was the matter-of-course reply,
and his lordship handed the paper to the Chair. It was forthwith read. The
Regent expressed his deep regret for the event, which he could never
cease to deplore, and recommended to the House to make a provision
for the family of Mr. Perceval.</p>

<p class="indent">It was then moved that the House should resolve itself
into a committee, to take into consideration the message; and that being
done, Lord Castlereagh took upon himself the task of addressing the
members on the painful subject which they were then to entertain.
His lordship spoke with great feeling. A more than official attachment
seemed to connect his lordship with the late premier. On an
occasion then recent, when the conduct of his lordship had been the
subject of grave accusation respecting the disposal of certain seats
in that House, Mr. Perceval had defended him with great earnestness
and success; and, doing so, his declaration was, "I raise my
voice for the man I esteem, and the friend I love."</p>

<p class="indent">In the course of his statement, the noble lord had, in
connexion with the awful event of the preceding day, to make known the
conviction of the ministry, from all the inquiries that had down to
that hour been instituted, that the act of Bellingham was perfectly
unconnected with any general scheme or conspiracy. Proceeding to
speak of the domestic distress it had caused, he said, the children left
by Mr. Perceval were twelve in number. "For the widow," he
added, "her happiness in this world is closed;" and the painful
feelings by which he was oppressed so overpowered him, that he was
unable to proceed. He burst into tears, and with strong emotions
raised a handkerchief to his eyes, and concealed his face for some moments.</p>

<p class="indent">With a knowledge of subsequent events, I cannot but
recall this passage of Lord Castlereagh's address, though perfectly appropriate
at the time, with a cynical glance,&mdash;a something between mirth and
sorrow. Looking at the picture drawn of Mrs. Perceval, and remembering
that horror at learning the fate of her husband was said to
have almost petrified her; that, wild and unconscious, the most fatal
effects were anticipated from her excessive woe, till, by the advice of
her medical attendants, she was led into the room where the corpse
of her lord was lying, when that ghastly spectacle caused her
tears to flow, and thus afforded the bursting heart some relief; I
cannot recall these things, without connecting with them the news
which the fashionable world were destined at no very distant period
to receive, that this afflicted and heart-broken lady, the mother of
twelve children, had been again led to the altar by a gallant officer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
much younger than herself. Of the matrimonial discord that followed,
I will not speak.</p>

<p class="indent">I am not going to copy from the journals of the House the
particulars of the grant proposed as a provision for the Perceval family,
nor from the papers of the day the debates to which the event gave
rise. What I propose to do is, merely to give a few sketches of the
attendant circumstances, which may be thought interesting now, but
were lost sight of then, from the pressure of matter of greater importance.</p>

<p class="indent">Let it then suffice to say that the House cordially approved
of the course recommended by the Crown. Mr. Whitbread, who had been
one of the most unsparing opponents of the departed premier, was
frequently in tears. He bore testimony to the amiable personal character
of the late minister. "I never," said he, "carry hostility to
those from whom I differ on political questions beyond that door,"
pointing to the door opening into the lobby: "with that man it was
impossible to carry it so far."</p>

<p class="indent">It is due to that honourable gentleman to say that this was
not a mere <i>post mortem</i> compliment. With the deceased he had often
come into collision. Mr. Whitbread was irritable, and was sometimes
deeply stung by the sarcasms launched at him by Mr. Perceval. In
one debate the latter, having adverted to predictions formerly made
by Mr. Whitbread, which had not been borne out by events, and to
new ones then hazarded, applied to his assailant the words of Pope,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Destroyed his web of sophistry in vain,</span>
<span class="i10">The creature's at his dirty work again."</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">Mr. Whitbread, nettled at this, spoke to order, and demanded
that the words should be taken down. A very brief and simple explanation
restored his good humour, and the subject was dropped. On
another occasion, not long before Mr. Perceval's death, when some
personal altercation had occurred between them, the right honourable
gentleman, in explaining away that which had given offence,
took occasion to say that among his faults&mdash;and he had many&mdash;want
of respect for the honourable member was not one of them. Mr.
Whitbread, in cordially accepting the explanation, replied, that
"among all the right honourable gentleman's virtues&mdash;and he had
many&mdash;there was none more to be admired than the promptness with
which he could return to friendly conference from the heat of
political debate."</p>

<p class="indent">There was, indeed, much affability about Mr. Perceval's
manner. Many anecdotes of his condescension were published at the time.
An instance of his courtesy and good-nature occurs to me which
has never appeared in print.</p>

<p class="indent">At a grand city feast in Guildhall, the publisher of a
fashionable journal having taken wine rather freely, was hoaxed by some
mischievous friend with a belief that Mr. Perceval was one of the
officers of the hall, and under this impression, wishing to leave for a
short time, accosted him with a theatrically pompous air, which the
individual (a well-known character at that time among the votaries
of the drama,) loved to assume, and said,</p>

<p class="indent">"My good fellow, I wish to step into King-street for a moment;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
to slip half-a-crown into the hands of the prime minister. The
gift was declined, and Mr. Perceval replied with a smile, "I am sorry
it is not in my power to oblige you; but you had better speak to
some of those gentlemen," pointing to the marshalmen; "they may
be able to do what you wish."</p>

<p class="indent">While the good qualities of the deceased were rehearsed,
and the consequences of his fate to the government and to the country were
discussed, curiosity naturally turned to the cause of the important
change. Great was my surprise to learn that the individual was not
wholly unknown to me; I was soon reminded of the singular personage
who had attracted notice by his manner and his opera-glass in
the gallery. That was no other than Bellingham; and two of the
gentlemen who had been in the habit of meeting, and perhaps of
conversing with him there, were the first who advanced after the
dreadful deed to secure him in the lobby.</p>

<p class="indent">The remainder of that unhappy man's story is soon told.
In the course of a day or two the coroner's inquest returned a verdict of
wilful murder, and the grand jury a true bill against him. On the
Friday he stood at the bar of the Old Bailey to take his trial. He
made a long rambling defence, and occasionally his agony was so
great, not for his impending fate, but from recollection of the sufferings
of a wife, whom he described with fondness, that it deeply affected
all present. It was attempted to prove him insane; but certainly
there were no grounds for considering him in that state which
the law requires shall be proved to exempt the murderer from capital
punishment. He himself opposed that plea. A verdict of
Guilty was returned, and on the succeeding Monday the sentence of
death was carried into effect. The case was from the first so clear,
the evidence so conclusive, that the prisoner was perhaps the only
man in England who expected any other result. He seemed to look
for an acquittal. With every one else conviction and death were
thought inevitable,&mdash;indeed so much matters of course, that the
following singular announcement, through some slip of the pen, in the
<i>Morning Post</i> of Thursday, "The trial will take place to-morrow, the
execution on Monday," was hardly viewed as reprehensible, hazardous,
or extraordinary; though certainly such a one, but in that single
instance, I have never seen.</p>

<h2>LOVE IN THE CITY.</h2>
<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p class="indent">In offering the following dramatic production to a discerning
public, the author respectfully intimates, that, notwithstanding an accidental
similarity in name between this play and one by Mr. William Shakspeare,
in plot, language, and situations, the two dramas will be found
to differ totally. "<i>Love in the City</i>" is of that order generally
termed "the Domestic;" and, while the incidents are varied, simple, and
common-place, it is to be hoped that the <i>dénouement</i> will be
acknowledged singularly striking and effective.</p>

<p class="indent">To restore the legitimate drama, whose neglect has been
so long and uselessly deplored, has been the author's principal aim; and, in
the construction of the play here presented to the world, he trusts
that he has eminently succeeded. No German horrors have been employed;
the use of thunder and lightning has been dispensed with;
not even a dance of demons has been introduced; and, with the exception
of reproducing Mr. Clipclose, senior, in the second act, after
he had shuffled off this mortal coil, there is not an event in the whole
drama, but those of every-day occurrence.</p>

<p class="indent">Although "<i>Love in the City</i>" has been expressly written for
the eminent performers whose names are attached to the <i>dramatis personæ</i>,
the author will extend a limited privilege of acting to country managers,
he receiving a clear half of the gross receipts of their respective
houses. Any offer short of this stipulation will remain unattended to.
Music-sellers may address proposals for the melodies to Mr. Richard
Bentley; and, should my attempt at piracy be detected,&mdash;the copyright
of the drama being duly entered at Stationers' Hall,&mdash;persons
thus offending are respectfully informed that they will be subjected
to an action at law.</p>

<h2>MRS. JENNINGS,</h2>
<p class="f90 space-below1">"WHO WANTED SOMEBODY TO CARE FOR HER."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Theophilus Bullfinch</span> was a bachelor,
middle-aged, and sufficiently stout to look respectable. A spare man conveys a
feeling of spareness in all things. The eye never rests so contentedly as on a
fat and what is generally termed a "comfortable-looking" personage;
a stout man carries an appearance of wealth in the very folds of his
coat, and so did Theophilus Bullfinch. But, alas! although temptation
fell not in his way, he fell in the way of Mrs. Jennings!</p>

<p class="indent">"Time tells a tale,"&mdash;and we behold our bachelor located
at a watering-place, no less famous for the civility and unimposing character
of its inhabitants than the select nature of its visiters,&mdash;Margate.
This, no one, we are sure, will venture to deny, who has "seasoned"
it for three or four months. The kindly feelings of its inhabitants are
perceptible even in its ass-drivers. Where will you find such fatherly
boys to their donkeys,&mdash;such yellow shoes,&mdash;such society, as at
Margate? We are sure our readers will say with us, Nowhere!</p>

<p class="indent">Theophilus felt this; and ventured a trip, and a house, for he
bought one, urged thereto by a lady acquaintance, by name Mrs. Palaver,&mdash;a
lady who drove not only her husband, but a pair of ponies,
and astonished the eyes both of "quality" and "natives" by the way
she did the genteel,&mdash;that is, as far as her ponies went: for herself,
she had a soul above mean approbation. Among the "select" at the
libraries, Mrs. P. was the ruling star; and, to judge not only from the
redness of her face, but as her husband could testify, Mars in petticoats.
She shilling-loo'd and "one-in-three'd," even to the hinderance
of "The Concert;" but no one bore interruptions of this nature
with so much philosophical sweetness as Old Bones, the proprietor;
and as the "one-in-threes" bore to him a profit of three to one, the
dulcet tones of the signora of the rooms were often eclipsed by Mrs.
P.'s <i>shake</i>, or "<i>go</i>," as it is called. Our readers may be
curious as to the name of the "signora:" it was Mrs. Nobs by day,
Signora Nobini by night. And such a voice! The little boys in Hawley-square
heard as well as the company inside,&mdash;in fact rather better, for they
complained of its being a <i>leetle</i> too forte.</p>

<p class="indent">But although Mrs. Palaver put down shillings, she picked up
friends,&mdash;dear souls of the newest importation,&mdash;and among the rest
Mrs. Jennings. Mrs. Jennings was a widow who "<i>wanted somebody
to care for her</i>." She had a small independence, and, if we may venture
to judge from subsequent events, a <i>very</i> small independence;
in fact, it might be doubted if it were an independence at all. She
was tall, scraggy, and thin&mdash;we use a homely simile&mdash;as a pancake;
the effect of grief, doubtless. She had lost a husband, she said, who
doted on her; and, having lost so great a treasure, can we wonder
at her unwearied exertions to obtain a fresh supply of affection?
Theophilus was a man of money. Mrs. Jennings could not boast of
the same golden fruit; and, as she wanted "<i>somebody to care for her</i>,"
she fixed her eye&mdash;a grey one&mdash;upon Theophilus Bullfinch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"They met," not in a "crowd," but at a tea and card party;
at the mutual friend's, Mrs. Palaver, where real eighteenpenny Cape, and
diamond-cut sandwiches of the size and thinness of a three-cornered
note, indicated the gentility of the lady of the house. Theophilus
and the widow were partners,&mdash;a beginning not to be despised. Mrs.
Jennings looked confusion over her hand, and vowed her heart must
fall to his king of clubs. Theophilus blushed; she sighed, and intent
upon a <i>new game</i>, lost the rubber! Theophilus paid for himself;
the widow had a mind above trifles. Theophilus was tempted,&mdash;what
man is not at times?&mdash;and paid for Mrs. Jennings. The first
stone was laid, and the widow saw the church already built, the door
open, and the parson's hand in the same inviting position. The next
morning, Mrs. Jennings, our bachelor, and the <i>mutual friend</i> were to
perambulate the fields, or rather corn-fields, and numerous of the
"quality" were drifting along the chalky roads on an equestrian tour;
asses were at a premium, and young ladies legs <i>going up</i>. Our party
wended their way, and Mrs. J. talked of the days when she and Mr. J.
made love in a corn field. If she had only somebody <i>to care
for her</i>!&mdash;and Mrs. Jennings squeezed something very like a tear into
the corners of her eyes. We know not what effect they might have
had on the dear departed, but to our bachelor they appeared the
essence of affection,&mdash;pretty little drops, distilled from that great
alembic, the heart. Theophilus, we have before hinted, was unused
to the sweet witchery of womankind, and in the simplicity of his soul
thought tears must be a natural production! Let not the wise in the
lore of matrimony laugh at his ignorance,&mdash;Theophilus was a bachelor!</p>

<p class="indent">He was touched by this unexampled proof of, to him,
affection; and, drawing himself into closer proximity with Mrs. Jennings than
he had before ventured, began&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"My dear ma'am, don't distress yourself. Men are like ears of corn."</p>

<p class="indent">"I know it," cried Mrs. Jennings, twisting one round her finger as she spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">"Like grass, ma'am; and Time's scythe mows down husbands and fathers!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! oh!" sobbed the widow.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is there anything I can do to comfort you, ma'am?" asked Theophilus inquiringly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Jennings looked assent, and kept twisting the ear of corn.</p>

<p class="indent">"A good wife, ma'am, is a jewel,&mdash;the tears are still in your
eyes,&mdash;and will you allow me to make you an offer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"An offer!" said Mrs. Jennings; and the tears, spite of herself,
shrunk back, as though ashamed of what they were doing,&mdash;"an offer!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Of my handkerchief," said Theophilus.</p>

<p class="indent">A clover-field is a dangerous thing to walk in. Philosophers
may divine the cause,&mdash;we only know it is so; sentiment is not for the
highway: love and clover are synonymous. Mrs. Jennings knew this, and
trotted the unsuspecting, uninitiated Theophilus into one, accordingly.
Poppies, we know not why, do grow in clover; and Bullfinch&mdash;he
was fond of botanising&mdash;plucked one, and, lamenting that violets
were out of bloom, gave it to Mrs. Jennings. This was enough; and
she whispered to the lady who was doing <i>thirdy</i>, "He must mean something."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The town residence of Theophilus Bullfinch was in one
of the squares in the neighbourhood of the Museum. But what is a house
if it want a woman's smile? So thought Mrs. Jennings and she let
no opportunity pass of "popping in;"&mdash;we are grieved to say the
<i>popping</i> was all upon her side. She would call as she was passing&mdash;the
day was so hot&mdash;to take a rest; or the day was so cold, and she
wanted&mdash;the truth must be spoken&mdash;a warm! What could Theophilus
do? With a grim welcome on his face, and a "D&mdash;n the woman!"
in his heart, he grumbled out, "You'd better take a chair."
Mrs. Jennings did, and anything else she could get. But getting was
a point not easily arrived at; for if Bullfinch loved one thing more
than another, it was himself. She would bring him, by way of treat,
wrapt in the corner of her pocket handkerchief; five or six nice little
ginger-cakes, of her own making, of the size, and bearing a strong family
likeness to what children call "sixes;" but finding all her entreaties
thrown away, and her ginger-cakes likely to be in the same predicament,
she would in the liberality of her soul take them into the
kitchen by way of present to the housekeeper, who "pshaw'd!" as
soon as her back was turned, and, enlarging upon the merits of her
own ginger-cakes, gave them to the maid, and she&mdash;they went no
farther: servant-maids have good appetites.</p>

<p class="indent">What woman could bear these slights of fortune tamely?
We can take upon ourselves to say Mrs. Jennings did not; but, intent upon
the one great object of a woman's life,&mdash;a husband,&mdash;she let no
opportunity pass of reporting that herself and Theophilus were shortly
to be one, fully convinced of the fact that, though marriages may be
made in heaven, there is nothing like speculating upon them on
earth; and hoping, no doubt, to discover the true philosophers stone,
which "turneth all to gold,"&mdash;Theophilus was a man of wealth,&mdash;she
left no stone unturned to get him; and, to give things an appearance,
she sat herself down&mdash;we tremble as we write&mdash;in no less a place
than his bedroom, determined not to quit it until, as she observed,
"there was an understanding between them." Theophilus was horror-stricken,
the housekeeper no less so, and the servant-maid all flutters and ribbons.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! oh!" gasped the widow,
"you base man!&mdash;a weak woman as I am!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Very!" grunted Theophilus.</p>

<p class="indent">The housekeeper here interfered. "What's the use of
crying about it? Why don't you look after somebody else?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah!" sobbed the widow, "you don't know what's atwixt us!"</p>

<p class="indent">"I wish the street-door was," thought Bullfinch.</p>

<p class="indent">The lady was inexorable. "The poppy," she said, "had done
the business! If she had only <i>someone to care for her</i>!" Her feelings
overcame her, and she lay upon the bed in agony of finely-developed
grief, we presume, for the convenience of fainting.</p>

<p class="indent">Theophilus was at his wits' end, and a something very like a
"D&mdash;n me!" was at his tongue's; but, "nursing his wrath," and echoing
the words of an Eastern sultan, that "he who finds himself in a
fire ought to be resigned to the Divine will; but whoever is out of
the fire ought to be careful, and keep himself in his happy state."
Thus far he thought with Mahomet; so he put on his hat and sallied
forth, leaving Mrs. Jennings in undisputed possession of his bed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
Whether this argued a want of taste, or was only a chastening of the
spirit, we will not attempt to define; but certain it is he went out,
and the widow, finding her efforts ineffectual, did the ditto.</p>

<p class="indent">Days passed, and so did Mrs. Jennings the house; the
servant-maid, with a prudent industry, answering the door in the area.
Bullfinch (in a money-getting lane in the City the curious reader will
see the Co. written after it) was a merchant; and as, in the ordinary
course of things, it is necessary to emerge into the streets previously
to reaching the place "where merchants most do congregate," what
was to be done?&mdash;for never did cat watch a rat-hole more patiently,
more hungrily, than the widow the doorway of his house. His modesty
was not widow-proof; and the only way to shun her, was by a
back-door, which opened into a mews: patiently picking his way
through mire and dirty straw, did Theophilus, cursing widows and
poppies, wend his way; whilst she&mdash;patience had ceased to be a
virtue&mdash;vowed vengeance in the streets.</p>

<p class="indent">On a wet day, a day of gloom and splash,&mdash;the streets
running rivers, and the skies shedding drops like pebbles,&mdash;the passengers
dripping, drenching,&mdash;and the New Police, all love and oil-skin, sheltering
themselves under doors and gateways,&mdash;sat Theophilus Bullfinch,
Esq. in his easy-chair, brightening the blaze of warm fire by
a fresh "stir," smugly sipping his wine, and in the uprising of his
heart wishing confusion to all widows, and devoting a full glass to
the particular condemnation of Mrs. Jennings. Every now and then
he cast an eye to the patting rain and floating streets, and thanked
Heaven which had set the fruits of fortune ripened for his plucking,
and given him that which made life like a full cup, that he could drink
from, nor tire of. He sat in "contemplation sweet."</p>

<p class="indent">"Whence comes that knocking?" he might have said, had
not the servant-maid saved him the trouble, by saying a young man wanted
to see him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Me!" ejaculated Theophilus.</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir," was the reply, and, after much scrubbing on the
doormat, in a vein endeavour to rub his boots clean, the <i>young man</i>
was shown up, soaked to the skin, and dripping like a watering-pot.
Theophilus opened his eyes; the young man took the same liberty
with his mouth, and inquired if his name was Bullfinch? The answer
was in the affirmative. A chair was set; the servant left the room,
and, looking at the muddy footsteps on the stair-carpets, uttered
sundry pretty little sayings about "dirty feet," "her trouble in the
morning;" &amp;c. and retailed her complaints to the goddess of the kitchen.</p>

<p class="indent">The young man commenced by saying he had brought a little account.</p>

<p class="indent">"And a great deal of wet," gently murmured Theophilus. "A little account!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, sir,&mdash;for board and lodging."</p>

<p class="indent">Bullfinch opened his eyes still wider, and echoed "Board and lodging!"</p>

<p class="indent">"The bill, sir, is four-and-twenty pounds."</p>

<p class="indent">Another echo, and still higher uplifting of the eyebrows: "Where do you come from?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Blackheath, sir."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Blackheath! What! <i>through</i> the rain?"</p>

<p class="indent">The young man ventured a smile as he replied, "No, sir; I wish I had."</p>

<p class="indent">"Board and lodging!&mdash;you must have made a mistake."</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh no, sir," said the young man; "here is the bill,&mdash;twenty-four
weeks, at a pound a-week, as a parlour-boarder, at Mrs. Twig's establishment for young ladies."</p>

<p class="indent">Theophilus looked suspiciously at his silver spoons, and
eyed the bell-rope. But a new light seemed to break upon him at the mention
of the word "establishment," as he replied,</p>

<p class="indent">"I am afraid, my good sir, the 'establishment' you come from
is in St. George's Fields. I a parlour-boarder at a young ladies' school!"</p>

<p class="indent">"No, sir; not <i>you</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who then?" cried Theophilus.</p>

<p class="indent">"Mrs. Jennings, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">"Mrs. Who!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Jennings, sir."</p>

<p class="indent">Bullfinch sunk back into his uneasy-chair. "Mrs. Jennings!&mdash;Mrs.
Devil!" and in the bitterness of his spleen he deemed her no less a
personage. "Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;" The word, like Macbeth's <i>amen</i>,
"stuck in his throat."</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause. At length, plucking his courage by the ears,
he continued; "And do you expect me to pay for this old&mdash;&mdash;!"
We omit the word; no lady admires being likened to a dog.</p>

<p class="indent">"If you please, sir, I have put 'paid' to the bill."</p>

<p class="indent">"That's lucky, for it's the only way you'll ever have the
satisfaction of seeing it 'paid.' Four-and-twenty pounds!&mdash;not so many
farthings!" but the goodness of his disposition got the better of his
anger as he added, "unless to buy her a rope."</p>

<p class="indent">It is needless to dwell longer upon this occurrence, further
than by saying, that the "young man," finding the bill not in a way of being
"settled," or Mrs, Jennings either, took his beaver, or&mdash;we like to be
particular&mdash;his four-and-ninepenny, no longer a hat, but a piece of
ornamented brown paper in a fine state of decomposition, and was in
the act of leaving the room, when rat! tat! tat! went the door, and
another young man was announced with a bill for acceptance, drawn
by Messrs. Lutestring &amp; Co. for silks, flannels &amp;c. supplied to&mdash;Mrs.
Jennings! Monsieur Tonson was nothing to this! Another knock,
and a female was ushered up with a yard-long bill for millinery, &amp;c.
done for&mdash;Mrs. Jennings! The "Storm" upon the grand piano was
a mere puff to that raised by Bullfinch. He swore, raved, ordered
them from his house, and finally, thrusting his head between his
hands, groaned a bitter groan, and, smiting his brow, cried, "Oh, that
d&mdash;d poppy!"</p>

<p class="indent">The following morning, a suspicious-looking person, of
a pick-pockety exterior, and belonging to a similar industrious calling&mdash;he
was a lawyer's clerk&mdash;knocked at the knocker of Theophilus Bullfinch,
and with that gentlemanly ease and accomplished manner so
peculiar to young men in the law, handed to the aforesaid personage
a letter, prettily worded, and headed "Jennings <i>versus</i> Bullfinch."
It was a notice of action for "breach."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Tremble, oh, ye bachelors!&mdash;and oh, ye spinsters! smirk in the
hope of one day convincing the world you <i>ought</i> to have been married.
Mrs. Jennings was of the same opinion, and, in a spirit of
justice to her sex, put her case into the hands of Messrs. Twist and
Strainer, as respectable a firm as ever undertook a "breach of promise
case." It is needless to say they issued their process with
becoming expedition; and Bullfinch, sorely galled, mastered his antipathy,&mdash;we
cannot but think a very foolish one,&mdash;and applied to an
attorney!&mdash;in the hope&mdash;men catch at straws&mdash;that an
attorney <i>might</i> be an honest man! Alas! that a person of his years should
not have more wisdom!&mdash;It is perhaps necessary to inform the reader
that the damages were laid at five thousand pounds.</p>

<p class="indent">The day of trial arrived. Theophilus, with a blushing face
and tremulous heart, squeezed himself into a seat beside his legal adviser;
his eyes upon the floor, and his hands feelingly placed in his
pockets. He fancied all eyes bent on his, and smarted under them
as they were burning-glasses. By degrees his timidity abated, and
at the bustle occasioned by the judge coming into court had so far
summoned courage as to raise his eyes. They met, "gently beaming,"
the eyes of Mrs. Jennings, who was seated in the gallery. He
would rather have looked on a wolf's; but a sort of fascination,
as birds feel looking at serpents, kept them fixed,&mdash;nailed to the eyes
of what seemed to him his evil genius; whilst she, with the bland look
of injured innocence, jerked a few tears into her eyes, and, taking
out her pocket-handkerchief,&mdash;a clean one for the occasion,&mdash;wept,
that is, she appeared to do so; but a woman's tears, like her ornaments,
are not always real.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked, and Bullfinch spell-bound met her gaze;
but, as a friend of ours once said, "He gave her a look!"</p>

<p class="indent">The proceedings commenced. The learned counsel opened
the case by enlarging upon "the enormity of the defendant's crime, and
the plaintiff's unprotected state; a crime," the learned counsel went
on to say, "unparalleled in the annals of the law; a crime, my lord
and gentlemen, which breaks into the peace of families, and takes
from the lovely and the virtuous that jewel no wealth can barter,&mdash;her
reputation, gentlemen, her unspotted, her unblushing reputation!
Not that I would be understood to accuse the defendant of seduction.
No, gentlemen; the lady whose case I am pleading is too fair a flower
to be hurt by his calumniating breath!&mdash;she is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Here Theophilus uttered a word; we are grieved we
cannot repeat it; but the officer of the court bawled "Silence!" in so loud a
tone as completely to drown it. The learned counsel continued:</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, my lord and gentlemen, the defendant&mdash;I blush,
gentlemen, I blush," and the learned counsel was evidently overcome with the
novelty of his situation,&mdash;"the defendant is a man," he resumed,
"past the intoxicating meridian of life, when the feelings of youth
flutter like bees sipping flowers of the fairest hue. He has proved
himself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">Another ejaculation from Theophilus,
and again the officer "Silence'd!"</p>

<p class="indent">"He has proved himself a monster of the blackest dye,&mdash;a
reptile who ought to be crushed off the face of the earth! Oh, gentlemen,
did you but know the lady as I do,&mdash;have known the sanctity of her
private life, and the ethereal nature of her public one; her loveliness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
her virgin excellence, beloved by relations, idolized by her family!"
The lades in the gallery were visibly affected, and looked daggers at
the brute of a defendant. The counsel, after a pause, resumed:
"This, gentlemen, is the being for whom I am to plead. Englishmen
will, I am sure, never desert the ladies!"</p>

<p class="indent">The jury-box felt the appeal, and looked proudly dignified;
and after dwelling for two hours and three quarters on "the villain who
by his insidious wiles"&mdash;Theophilus looked patiently unconscious of
his Don Juan accomplishments&mdash;"had wormed himself into the
lady's affections, and then basely left her, a daisy on the stalk, to
pine!" he called upon them as husbands,&mdash;"Think of your wives,"
continued the counsel: they evidently did, and looked anything
but pleased; and urging them as fathers and as men to give the
plaintiff such damages as the enormity of the crime and the wealth
of the defendant warranted, the learned counsel sat down, evidently
to the satisfaction of himself and all who heard him.</p>

<p class="indent">It is needless to dwell longer upon this interesting trial,
as the curiously inclined may read a full account of it in any newspaper of
the date, and therein they will see it stated in evidence how the
"mutual friend" bore witness to Mr. Bullfinch picking the poppy and
paying for the widow at cards. Theophilus had often accused himself
of the folly, and sundry other little etceteras "too numerous to
mention." The housekeeper, in being cross-examined, also bore evidence,
though much against her will, to the intimacy of the parties.
The maid&mdash;women invariably hold by each other&mdash;always considered
master <i>'gaged</i> to Mrs. Jennings. The jury seemed to think so too,
and returned a verdict of&mdash;Theophilus never recovered the
shock&mdash;five hundred pounds!</p>

<p class="indent">Ye elderly bachelors, and ye bachelors of all degrees,
hear this and pause! There are specks in the sun; can you, in the vanity
of your hearts, think women more immaculate? Alas, the error!
Pause then, and, whenever you play at cards with a lady, think of
Theophilus Bullfinch, and never pay for your partner; and for the
rest of your lives, if you would escape actions for "breach," never
pick poppies, or walk in clover with widows!</p>

<p class="indent">"After all," said Theophilus, as he wrote a check for the
amount of damages, and another for the costs, "even this is better than being
bothered by Mrs. Jennings, especially as she <i>wanted somebody to care for her</i>."</p>

<h2>JOHN POOLEDOUNE,</h2>
<p class="f110 space-below1">THE VICTIM OF IMPROVEMENTS!</p>

<p class="indent">It was on a fine warm day in June, several years before
Beulah Spa was invented, that, eviting leafy Hampstead, and airy Highgate,
and woody Hornsey, John Pooledoune, with a party of companions, sought
the delights of a rural ramble and pic-nic, amid the sylvan scenery of
Norwood. Of the journey thither, the sporting there, the banquet on
the grass, the hilarious after-dinner bumpers, the casting away of
bottles, and the wide-spread waste of orts, there is no occasion to
speak; suffice it to state, that the frolic and profusion attracted a visit
from a couple of dark-haired and bright-glancing Gipsies, whose sojourn
was thereabouts, and who, though reckless of the present, were,
or pretended to be, deeply read in the future. Their appearance added
to the merriment of the occasion; and, with that natural curiosity
which belongs to human nature, our revellers agreed to have a peep
into futurity palmed upon them, at the small cost of a few silver coins.
One after another were their lines submitted to Sibyllic inspection;
and loud were their laughs as the pretty "brows of Egypt" bent over
their destinies, and told of coming estates, and wives, and children,
and, sooth to add, little amours and indiscretions which nevertheless
promised pleasures hardly less acceptable to the expectant listeners.
At length it fell to the turn of Jack Pooledoune, who was indeed so
well off in the world, that he had little either to hope or to fear from
the fickle goddess; when, all at once, a sudden chill crept over the
group, "a change came o'er the spirit of their dream," and the hitherto
gay and giggling priestesses of mystery assumed aspects of horror and
dismay. What before was curiosity was now intense interest. Whence
the cause of this awful alteration?&mdash;why had mirth in a moment given
place to these boding looks and signs of terror? Time and our tale
will show; and we have only here to record the prediction reluctantly
wrung from one of the distraught and shuddering Gipsies.</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh! strange unfortunate Fortunate!" she exclaimed as
she conned John Pooledoune's hand,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By making rich, made poor;</span>
<span class="i1">By making happy, miserable;</span>
<span class="i1">By amending, hurt; by curing, slain;</span>
</div></div>

<p>never Lost on earth, alive or dead, yet Found by numbers; bodiless
corpse; <i>The Victim of Improvement</i>, for ever to improve;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No hand to close thy eyes,</span>
<span class="i1">No eye to see thy grave,</span>
<span class="i1">No grave to give thee rest,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i5"><span class="smcap">Strange Being!</span></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dead; resembling Death, yet keeping thy place among the dead
and the living; thy end shall not be an ending, and every one shall know that
thou art and art not!"</p>

<p class="indent">With this fearful prophecy the Gipsies took to their heels;
and Jack, with an oath at their impudent mummery, shied half a half-quartern
loaf at their retreating heads. The iced punch was speedily resumed;
but, so strong is the hold of superstition upon us, even when wine and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
punch have infused a factitious courage, it was found impossible to
re-animate the convivial festival, and the party returned to town,
either in silent abstraction, or reverting to and commenting on the
oddness of the Gipsy foolery!</p>

<p class="indent">Old Roger Pooledoune was one of the busiest and most
substantial of hosiers in the ward of Cheap; a respectable citizen, whose
heart and soul were in his business, to which he attended from morning to
night as if, instead of toil, it were pleasure; and indeed it did
comprehend the mighty pleasure of profit, the be-all and the end-all of
many a cit. Stockings, stocks, and socks, braces, collars, gloves,
nightcaps, and garters, were all the same to honest Roger; and he would
serve his customers with equal cordiality with every one of these
articles, from the price of a grey groat to the cost of sterling gold.
Thus he dealt and throve. His shop was never empty, for his commodities
were reputed to be of good quality; and, in process of years,
his industry was rewarded with such increase, that his neighbours
declared him to be a warm man, and guessed his worth at no less
than thirty thousand pounds. Nor were they far wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">Roger, like a man ignorant of Malthus, had in the midst
of all his occupations found leisure to court and win a wife; and, in due process,
a certain portion of the stock in the warehouse, namely, some very small
socks, gaiters, &amp;c. had to be transferred <i>gratis</i> to the nursery,
where Isabella, Matilda, and Margaret, and last, John Pooledoune,
the only son, the fruits of his marriage-bed, required such
equipments from their fond father,&mdash;the fonder in consequence of the
last family event having made him a widower. Twenty years had
elapsed since that period of mingled joy and woe, of birth and death,&mdash;the
conjunction of the two extremes of human life,&mdash;when it occurred
to the corporation of the city of London that it would be a vast
improvement in the approaches thereto, and accommodation to the traffic
thereof, to have a new bridge thrown across the bosom of old Father
Thames, just where it suited a company of keen-sighted, speculative,
and money-making gentry to have that operation performed for the
public and their own benefit. It so happened that the site so agreeable
to them was exceedingly disagreeable to Roger Pooledoune, inasmuch
as it created a necessity for carrying a street, as it were the
string of a bow, direct to the bridge, not only leaving his shop at the
farthest bend of the said bow, but plunging it into an unfrequented
valley, or <i>cul de sac</i>, at which it was irksome to look from the
popular balustrades of the recent direct and splendid erections. Old
Roger, it is true, claimed and received a handsome,&mdash;a very handsome,
and neighbourly, and citizen-like compensation: for his loss in the daily
sale of nightcaps and garters was estimated at the sum of fourteen
thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven pounds sixteen shillings
and fivepence three farthings: but, like Othello, his occupation was
gone. The money obtained in a lump was not like the money gained
by slow and minute degrees. He became uncomfortable, uneasy,
irritable; he would gaze up towards the new street to the new bridge,
and, counting the passing crowds, would calculate on the proportional
passing demand for ready-made hosiery of every description. The
whole was diverted into another channel: he could not bear the sight,
he could not endure the idea; and so he pined, and he sickened, and
he died, for want of a brisk retail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The disposition of the defunct hosier's property was
such as might be expected from a wealthy and prudent tradesman. He had
sunk the fourteen thousand and odd pounds in annuities on his three
daughters, and so tied them up, that none but themselves&mdash;nor brother,
nor friend, nor husband, nor lover&mdash;could receive the half-yearly
dividends; and, if loan or mortgage were attempted upon them,
they were forfeited for ever. Thus were they provided with inalienable
competencies for the terms of their natural lives. To John was
left the residue, which, when the good will of the shop was with
good will disposed of for nothing, everything else settled, and affairs
wound up, was ascertained to amount to the neat round sum of two-and-thirty
thousand pounds; and thus warmly provided, the gipsy foredoomed
Victim of Improvements began the world, his own master, and for
himself alone.</p>

<p class="indent">John Pooledoune had received what is called a first-rate
"commercial and classical education," at a boarding-school near Deptford,
where these identical words were painted in capital letters on a board
which ran along the entire façade of the building. He had thus been
prepared for more general and severer pursuits; and accordingly,
about that era when the first drum was beat for the March of Intellect,
he enrolled himself in the ranks for the diffusion of knowledge,
and, to speak comparatively, soon reached the distinction of a halbert
in the cause. He became a leading man in the Mechanics' Institutes,
attended lectures on every possible subject at least five evenings in
every week, was elected a member of the Society of Arts and of the
Statistical Society, joined the British Association at Bristol,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
and, in fine, adopted the most admired course to become a utilitarian of the
first water. He was acknowledged to be an independent, and sensible,
and well-informed individual; he needed neither favour nor assistance,
had plenty of ready money in the funds, and was courted and
caressed accordingly. He was, in short, a faultless monster.</p>

<p class="indent">But not only had Fortune been kind to him; Nature was
equally liberal: he was well-proportioned in lith and limb; stout, healthy,
and well-looking. If not a perfect, but, rather, as George the Fourth
would say, an ungentlemanly gentleman, he was not a vulgar plebeian;
and, altogether, hardly ever did a man start in the middle
walks of life with so fair a promise of prosperity and happiness. John
Pooledoune had the silver spoon to his mouth,&mdash;the salt of the earth
to his portion.</p>

<p class="indent">With such qualities, and to such a character, inactivity
was impossible. Inclination and means led to projects of utility, and John was
determined to benefit mankind by his efforts in promoting the ingenious
conceptions of the clever and the "talented." His apartments
were encumbered with models, his chairs and his tables laden with
plans; nay, he even fancied at times that he was himself an inventor.
It was, to be sure, only in a small way, but it kept the ruling passion
in a blaze; and when he took out his first patent for a broom to eat
its own dust, his ecstasies had nearly laid him with the dust, to which
he was thus made doubly akin.</p>

<p class="indent">It is wonderful to behold how many of our species, full
of the most extraordinary and indubitable inventions, from which indescribable
riches must accrue, languish in abject poverty: to such, a John
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
Pooledoune is a god-send, even though it may be that in the issue he
is reduced to fraternization. He was the friend of projectors, the
believer in perfectibility, but singularly unlucky in nearly all his
undertakings. Of these we must mention a few, the leading incidents
of a brief career.</p>

<p class="indent">We have alluded to the patent for a dust-consuming
broom, with which John was so marvellously elated. The worst of it was,
that it involved him in a law-suit with Mr. Pratt, who clearly proved to the
judge and jury that he had perfected a similar besom
five years before. It was in vain that John's counsel argued that his
broom acted transversely, not horizontally; and possessed a vertical,
not a rotary action; in vain he asserted that new brooms swept
cleanest: the verdict was for the plaintiff; and the infringement of the
right to use a useless brush cost Mr. Pooledoune within a trifle of a
thousand pounds. The lawyers and attorneys declared that it was a
shameful verdict, and advised Mr. Pooledoune to move for a new trial;
but he had sense enough to be satisfied with one.</p>

<p class="indent">Misfortunes, we are told, never come single. Like crows,
if you see one alight on a field, you may be pretty sure there will soon be
a few more, and probably a flock; and so it fell out with our hero's mischances.</p>

<p class="indent">A company was formed upon the most admirable principles
to supply the metropolis with pure water instead of the abomination hitherto
imbibed from the polluted river, the grand recipient of the filth of a
million and a half of nasty people. It was to be brought from Tonbridge
Wells, laid on in crystal pipes, and supplied with a bounty that
defied competition. John Pooledoune became a large shareholder
and a director; but somehow or other the stream did not run smooth,
the crystal pipes broke, and so did the company; and John, being a
responsible person, got out with the largest share&mdash;of the loss. He
next embarked in gas works, the most prosperous that ever were
demonstrated by calculations and estimates on the tables printed by the
projectors. But this design, alas! also failed: the gas dissolved into
thin air; and another troublesome and expensive law-suit proved that
the thousands of tons of coke which had been consumed were utterly
wasted, as their use in that particular way, custom, and manner, was
not sanctioned by Coke upon Lyttleton.&mdash;See <i>Vesey's Reports</i>,
div. 4, cap. 3, lib. 2, page 1.</p>

<p class="indent">This was another rather severe blow upon Mr. Pooledoune,
who began to reflect on the uncertainty of all pursuits of the kind. "I
will not," said he to himself, "risk any more considerable sums in
such plans. Houses and lands," said he, "are certain, real, visible,
tangible property: I will buy an estate and build a house upon it."
Accordingly, day after day did he examine those oracles of truth, the
morning newspapers; and particularly that portion of them which is
the truest of the true, the advertisements of the auctioneers. Long
did he ponder over the most desirable of investments, the most eligible
of sites, the paradises of nature, the soils which scantily concealed
inexhaustible mines, the views of hanging woods whose trees never
changed their fruits: long did he balance which it were best to possess;
and at last he was fortunate enough to be allowed to purchase
one of George Robins' most extraordinary bargains, an estate which
was positively "given away". It was nevertheless dear enough to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
buyer; and the seller had not so much reason as might be imagined to be
dissatisfied with the prodigal liberality of his agent on the occasion.
The land was found to be susceptible of no inconsiderable improvement;
and the charming, picturesque, indescribably interesting,
and gothically elegant, fine, ancient mansion, was in truth little better
than an inconvenient and incongruous pile of ruins. But as Mr.
Pooledoune had, from the first, intended to cultivate the earth in his
own way, and to erect a mansion upon his own design, these slight
discrepancies did not so much signify. The titles were actually good,
and old Hurlépoer Hall was regularly transferred, made over, granted,
and assigned to its new proprietor, John Pooledoune, esquire. It is a
proud thing to be an esquire, the owner of broad acres, to walk over
fields you can call your own, to speak of your domain and your country
house, of your Hurlépoer Hall, and the parts and appurtenances
thereunto pertaining. Never did John Pooledoune feel so elevated as
when he arrived in a post-chaise to take possession of his beautiful
estate. It was only an amusing drawback, which served to occupy
his time, that he had to pull down the old hall and re-edify it in a
modern style. There was ready money, and the work went briskly
on, till at last a handsome villa stood where Hurlépoer, or at least some
of its walls, had outbraved the winds and rains two hundred winters.
It was christened Hosiery Hall by some of the poor and envious landlords
round about; but it was nevertheless a very pretty place, and
constructed on the most novel and approved principles of architecture.
The foundations were laid in Roman cement, the timbers were steeped
to saturation in Kyan's anti-dry-rot composition, and the roof was of
patent cast-iron. Nor had Mr. P. during the season been inattentive
to the cultivation of his ground. The steward, a positive, ignorant,
and impracticable ass, was dismissed the service, for insisting upon
sowing wheat, and barley, and oats; laying certain portions fallow, and
turnip-cropping other parts. The squire taking affairs into his own
hands, the farm-horses were sold, and a wonderfully perfect steam-plough
put into operation. Instead of turnips, the cow-cabbage
was introduced, and room left about every plant to allow it to extend
to its full dimensions of from eighteen to twenty-two feet in
diameter. The corn-arable was converted into plantations of beetroot
for the manufacture of sugar, and a thousand hogsheads for
its reception were ordered of the coopers. Everything went on tolerably
well for a while, except the plough, which always refused
to move up hill or to go straight on the level, and very soon denied
motion in any manner, or in any direction. Mr. Pooledoune, incensed
at this misconduct, which he attributed to the stupidity of
the ploughman and the malice of the quondam driver, who had no
longer any horses to drive, and consequently went whistling alongside,
occasionally eyeing his useless whip, as if he would gladly
apply it to his master's back, in a moment of anger took the stilts
himself, to show the boors how it ought to be done. He poked the
fire and filled the kettle, and off set the machine with a run. Unluckily
there was a great stone in the line of the furrow, against which
the plough was dashed with so much force that it tilted up, and,
throwing down its unfortunate holder, dashed the burning coals and
boiling steam all over his body. Dreadfully scalded, it was many
weeks before the squire was sufficiently convalescent to leave his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
room; and when he did once again visit his <i>ci-devant</i> green fields,
it was as a cripple from the severe accident. The melancholy of autumn,
too, was upon the scene,&mdash;a melancholy untempered to him by
the sight of sweeps of ripened grain, (the yellow gold of nature,) and
the busy hum of harvest. The season had been unusually dry, and
the soil was chalky. Owing to this the cow-cabbages had not flourished,
and only one here and there was visible, and about the ordinary
size of a tailor's dinner, though with plenty of room to grow
larger if it liked. The cultivation of the beetroot was hardly more
successful; still there was wherewithal to try the experiment of
sugar-making, and to this our sanguine hero turned with his indomitable
spirit. The process went on, and the roots were crushed;&mdash;so,
speedily, were his hopes. Twenty-seven barrels of bad molasses
was the produce of above eight hundred acres of the best land belonging
to Hurlépoer Hall. It was a year of dead loss, and there was
nothing left for it but to get through the winter as comfortably as
possible, and prepare for taking the field in the spring with greater
experience, and a more <i>improved</i> system throughout.</p>

<p class="indent">It is a well-known fact with regard to the weather in England,
that if there be a balance of good and bad, the latter never fails to occupy
its fair proportion of foulness. As the summer had been unusually
warm and dry, the winter turned out unusually cold and wet. The
rain hardly ceased during four months, the country was a swamp, and
there was not even enough for a dry joke in the parish. One night
the storm descended, hail was shaken and lightning glanced from the
wings of the mighty tempest: it was a <i>perfect</i> hurricane,
(for hurricanes are so called when they are most fearfully outrageous,)
and blew great guns. In the midst of the rattling, and spouting, and
howling, a dreadful crash was heard by the inhabitants of Hurlépoer
villa; the walls tottered, and they rushed forth in nakedness and
desperation. Nor had they a moment to spare; for the Roman-cement
foundations gave way, the anti-dry-rot timbers split into a thousand
splinters, and the ponderous patent iron roof descended with one
awful and crushing demolition upon the wrecks below. Poor Pooledoune
was again unfortunate. Having delayed a minute to save an
electrical apparatus for making diamonds of flints and asparagus, in
which he had all but succeeded, he was struck by a projected mass of
the broken wood, and had his right arm very badly fractured.</p>

<p class="indent">With these calamities terminated John Pooledoune's
rural experiments. Hurlépoer was soon again in the market, but the value
of land had fallen tremendously within the last eighteen months; and,
though the auctioneer did his utmost, that which had cost twenty
thousand pounds so short a while ago was sold for eight thousand
pounds, and John's whole fortune reduced to little more than ten.
Still there was a competency; and with the mind of a projector there
is always contentment. John bought a small ready-furnished house,
about two miles out of London, and sat down under its lowly slate
roof, and all his troubles, with most philosophic apathy.</p>

<p class="indent">He engaged in lesser speculations with the same ardour with
which he had embarked in extensive undertakings; but the doom of the Gipsies
of Norwood was still upon him, and

<p>continued to mark his progress&mdash;his progress!&mdash;his retrograde progress in life.</p>

<p class="indent">He had not been settled in his humble abode beyond the first
quarter, making discoveries in science of the most astonishing description,
when a railroad between Billingsgate and Blackwell drove him
from his home. Private interests must always yield to public advantages.
The road went right through Mr. Pooledoune's parlour; but
then, when completed, how easy it would be to bring, by its ready
means, white-bait from the water-side to the city; and how much
toil and expense would be saved to the citizens in having their feed
without the trouble of journeying so far for it in the heat of sultry
summer. The greatest affliction to the individual was not the deterioration
which his fortune again experienced in removing, but a calamity
which had almost overwhelmed even his steadfast soul. We
have said he was on the point of realising the most amazing discoveries
in natural science. By a battery of unlimited galvanic power,
continually directed to stones abstracted from St. Paul's Cathedral,
Waterloo-bridge, and the Monument, he had ascertained that the
church was built of the fur of the <i>pulex</i>, the bridge of butterflies'
facets, and the Monument of midges' wings. Indeed he had obtained
all these creatures entire and lively, in the course of his experiments
upon decomposing the St. Paul pebbles, the Waterloo-bridge granite,
and the Monumental free-stone; and the only difficulty which remained
for solution was, that above a hundred other unknown and
undescribed insects, probably of the antediluvian world, had been
produced at the same time, and by the same means. It was hard,
but the railroad caused the destruction of this theory; and several of
the retorts being broken, the revivification interrupted, the reanimated
killed, and the whole process served out, Mr. Pooledoune never enjoyed
another opportunity for demonstrating these incomparable results.
Thousands of years may elapse before any other experimentalist succeed
to such an extent; and millions of men and philosophers of intermediate
generations will die meanwhile, ignorant of the prodigious
injury done to science and to John Pooledoune by the railroad between
Billingsgate and Blackwell.</p>

<p class="indent">As we descend, we diminish in the eyes of those to
whom we were distinguished objects whilst dwelling on the same or a higher
elevation:&mdash;do we not really become less and less? Pooledoune's pursuits
continued to be similar in character, in opinions, in expectations; but,
ah! how different in worldly esteem! At the Mechanics' Institutes he
was no longer promoted to the front-seats,&mdash;at the Society of Arts he
was no more invited to deliver his sentiments,&mdash;his little contribution
of insulated facts was unsought by the Statisticals,&mdash;and the British
Association was too far off, with its Edinburgh and Dublin festivities,
to meet his conveniency. Yet he devoted himself to the confusion
of knowledge; and, in order to obtain larger interest on his fading
capital, he dabbled in Mexican and Payous, and Greek loans.</p>

<p class="indent">Perfecting a fulminating powder to supersede the use of
gunpowder, which could not explode except by the touch of a particular preparation,
an ounce of it accidentally ignited one day, and blew out his right eye.</p>

<p class="indent">John's hair grew prematurely grey with such crosses,
and he invented a dye to render it beautifully black. Most of those whom he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
persuaded to give it a trial were turned most curiously grizzle, green,
or yellow;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
but, perhaps from using an inordinate quantity, his own scalp was utterly
removed, and his scull rendered as bald and shining as a polished pewter plate,
whence the meat had been removed, but not the gravy.</p>

<p class="indent">He patronised Mechi's razor-strops and Hubert's roseate
powder, in consequence of which all the lower features of his face became a
mass of purulent offence.</p>

<p class="indent">He took to an infallible dentifrice, which preserved the
enamel, and whitened without injuring the teeth. It was a noble specific,
and did not contradict its advertisement: but all John's teeth fell out;
and though the enamel was preserved, and they were white, his gums
were exposed, empty, and red. He supplied his loss with a set of
china ornaments, which made him grin and nod like a Mandarin, but
with which he could not eat like a Christian, nor sleep like a savage.</p>

<p class="indent">John got poorer and poorer, shabbier and shabbier,
sicklier and sicklier. He had been blown up by gas, burnt down by steam,
ruined by railroads, cursed by every improvement on the whole pack of
cards. He was crippled in his limbs, deficient of an eye, disfigured
in face and person, and, worse than worst of all, his friends knew that
he had but little left, and less to hope for. It was not four years
since John Pooledoune had begun his career with a sound constitution,
and two-and-thirty thousand pounds of ready money,&mdash;worth
sixty thousand in any other way! Surely he was the "<i>Victim of Improvement</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">Nearly at last, when seen in the streets, John would point
to his waterproof shoes, and hat the better for being soaked twenty-four
hours in a washing-tub; and one noticed that his ugly-looking outer
garment was a proof Macintosh, and his patent spectacles set in cases
of india-rubber. And even his sorry truckle-bed, to which the late
squire of Hurlépoer Hall now nightly sought his obscure and darkling
way, was surmounted by a patent tick (it was double tick, for he had
it on credit from an old philosophical crony,) filled with hot
water,&mdash;as had been the brief course of the unfortunate to whom
it could afford no rest.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether from the Macintosh preservative cloak, the
waterproof shoes, the water-filled bed, the india-rubber, or the rubs
of the weather, we have not ascertained; but poor John caught a horrid
cold, and his cough was sadly aggravated by a contrivance in his
chimney for consuming its own smoke. This the chimney resolutely
refused; and, like all other quarrels, got so incensed that it would
not even carry the smoke up. Cold, asthma, suffocation and starvation,
were then the miserable companions of the quondam wealthy John Pooledoune.</p>

<p class="indent">In the misery of his heart, the wretched man took to drinking.
<i>That</i> resource, under any circumstances, must very quickly have
brought on the crisis; but true to the last, John resorted to patent
British brandy, and his fate was astonishingly accelerated.</p>

<p class="indent">One dusky evening, in a state of inebriety, the ragged
philosopher walked, or rather staggered out. The cool air breathed upon his
fevered brow; he saw the streets illumed with gas, he witnessed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
smoke ascending from steam-engines, and, overcome by his emotions,
when a Gravesend steamer, having beautifully run down another a
hundred yards below, swept into the Adelaide Wharf he threw himself
over London Bridge, and sank in the disturbed bosom of the
silver, insulted, and persecuted Thames.</p>

<p class="indent">Wearily had his life dragged on for many a day, and yet
it was doomed to another drag. Before he had been two minutes in the
water, this last-mentioned combination of cards, creepers, and hooks,
brought him to the surface, having caught him by his bald pate, and
he was carried ashore in a sculler. The nearest surgeon being called
in, happened to differ from the Humane Society, and hung him
up by the heels while he administered stimulants; but John had
imbibed so little of the element, that even this treatment did not
kill him. But his look was deadly, and he was so debilitated by
the medical treatment, that to be restored was impossible; and the
parish authorities of <i>Saint &mdash;&mdash; </i>, inspecting his sorry
equipments, became alarmed lest he should die where he had no business,
and put them to the expense of a funeral. He was asked where he
lived, in order that he might also die there; and a cart being procured,
under the New Poor Law Act, he was carted towards the
dismal abode he had indicated. His road lay along the new street
to the new bridge; and, about a hundred yards down, in a dark avenue
on his left, <i>he</i> could <i>not</i>, though others might, see the
once rich and respected tenement of his father, Roger Pooledoune, hosier
and citizen of London.</p>

<p class="indent">The night was frosty and bleak: John's clothes were thin
and wet. Had he been taken to an old woman instead of a medical theorist,
and dried and cherished even by the commonest fire of the parish workhouse,
he would have survived his "accident:" but the law was imperative;
he must be moved to his own parish, and he was moved
into the parish of Eternity,&mdash;the parish which holds the rich and
the poor, and Heaven only knows how they are provided for. Before
the cart reached the "Union," John Pooledoune was a corpse.</p>

<p class="indent">On the ensuing day but one, a coroner's inquest sat upon
his body, and one or two of the jurors were men who had known him in his
prosperity. They could hardly identify the meagre and mutilated
remains; but, in tenderness to the officials, who had killed him by
doing all for the best, they returned a verdict of "Found Drowned."</p>

<p class="indent">Not being conchologists, we shall not attempt to describe
the shell in which it was pretended that John Pooledoune was buried.
In that shell no muscle of his ever reposed; it held a few of the
paving-stones of the adjacent lane, which, if John had been alive to
submit to his galvanic battery, would have been demonstrated to be
composed of bumble bees' sacchyrometers. About the same hour that
the stones were interred with the solemn ritual of the church service
by the chaplain, the body also furnished the subject of a lecture
by the surgeon of the workhouse to the pupils in an adjoining hospital.
The scull in particular was singularly formed, at least it was
so declared by the phrenologists, who were allowed to claw it, and
who clearly showed that the bumps (caused by the watermen's drags)
were organs of philoprogenitiveness, amativeness, and destructiveness.</p>

<p class="indent">In due time a perfect skeleton of John Pooledoune was scraped
and prepared, and placed in a glass case in the museum of the hospital.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">And thus was fulfilled the Gipsy's prophecy. He was "by
curing, slain;" he was "never lost on earth, alive or dead," for he was dragged
from the river and preserved in the surgeons' hall; he was
"found by numbers" of sensible coroner's inquest men! he is yet in
his glass case a "bodiless corpse, the victim of improvement, for
ever to improve" the students of anatomy. There was</p>

<span class="i0">"<i>No hand to close his eyes;</i></span>
<span class="i1"><i>No eye to see his grave;</i></span>
<span class="i1"><i>No grave to give him rest!</i>"</span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">He is "dead, resembling Death," yet keeps "his place among
the dead and the living." "His end has not been an ending," and every
one who inspects the hospital collection may know that "he <i>is</i> and <i>is not</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">In a moral magazine such as Bentley's Miscellany
it is naturally expected that a useful and instructive inference should be drawn
from every tale; and assuredly ours needs little to point it: "<i>May we all
be preserved from the fascinations of Gipsies!</i>"</p>

<h2>THE LEGEND OF MOUNT PILATE.</h2>

<p class="indent">Superstition is to this day a strong characteristic of
the inhabitants of the Alps. A reason for this, is easily found in the various
and imposing phenomena of Nature, to which these simple mountaineers
are daily and nightly witnesses. A storm, which on the
plains would scarcely attract attention, offers at each instant, in these
lofty and diversified regions, some new and appalling spectacle. Each
clap of thunder finds a thousand echoes, and is reverberated almost
to infinity. The lightning's flash plays not only above, but about and
underneath the beholder. Here a roaring torrent dashes past him
down the precipitous rocks, driving all before it in its impetuous
course; there a sudden whirlwind uproots the sturdy monarch of the
forest, and bears it aloft, as though it were a feather on the breeze.
The heavy cloud, which one moment envelopes the poor shepherd in
its vapoury folds, in the next is seen rolling its dense masses over the
lower earth, hundreds of fathoms beneath his feet. Nor are the
calmer sublimities by which he is at other times surrounded less
calculated to speak to his imagination than the loud voice of the
bellowing tempest. The plaintive murmuring of the vernal breeze amid
the lofty pines; the deep silence of the summer's burning noon; the
fantastic changes of the fleecy cloud, whose form is varied by every
pinnacle of the mountain; the hollow and mournful moaning of the
autumnal gusts as they scatter far and wide the falling leaves; the
bright beam of the resplendent moon, across which each jutting crag
throws some grotesque shadow; and above all, the mist, which, rising
from the plains a mere mass of dull and dank vapour, here first appears
to receive life, and takes innumerable shapes and forms, incredible
to those who have never witnessed its airy evolutions! These
are the ever-varying phantasmata of nature that pass in scenic succession
before the eyes of the Alpine peasant, and add fresh fuel to
the fire of his superstitious inclinations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">It was in scenes of this inspiring character that Ossian
saw his shadowy armies, his warrior ghosts, his visionary maids, and heard the
wild music of their aërial harps. And although from the imperfectness
of our nature, we are all liable to have "our eyes made the fools
of the other senses," yet is it in these cloud-capped regions alone that
the illusions are always of a dignified order, and that poetry spreads
her veil of enchantment over the dull realities of life.</p>

<p class="indent">Such was the nature of my reflections after I had retired
to rest upon the night before my intended pilgrimage to Mount Pilate; and,
having made them, I slept soundly until the bright beams of a July
sun darting in at my latticed window gave me notice of the morning's
growth. I arose from my bed of leaves and rushes, and, strolling forth
into the open air, tasted the delicious sweetness of the hour. Never
do I remember a more enchanting prospect than here met my view.
It seemed as if Nature had proclaimed a universal holiday. She was
abroad in her gala dress; while Spring and Summer, her vernal and
blooming handmaids,&mdash;the former lingering as though loth to quit her
mistress, the latter rushing to anticipate her call,&mdash;appeared on either
side of her, and strewed her rosy path with freshness and fragrance.
The dews of night, glistening in the first rays of the slanting
sun, spangled the green carpet of the earth; and the tall pines, ever
the first to greet the morning breeze, gracefully bowed their dark
heads to welcome day's return. Far across the intervening lake, the
flocks and herds were seen winding slowly up the mountain's side in
search of their wholesome pasture; while the simple harmony of their
bells, mingling with the wild song or whistle of their urchin conductors,
came upon my ear over the still waters in distant snatches, and
formed, with the loud melody of the feathered minstrels close around
me, a rural concert in happiest unison with the scene. A tap on the
shoulder from my venerable conductor aroused me from my reverie.
Our preparations were soon made; and with a small wallet destined to
contain the necessary provision for such a journey, and each a long
staff, pointed at one end and hooked at the other, such as is required
for the ascent and descent of the precipitous paths we were to tread,
we commenced our march. We proceeded first to Brunnen, where
we took water upon the fairest of Switzer's lakes, and before sunset
arrived at Lucerne, the town from which it takes its name. The next
morning we were again afoot betimes, and, as we jogged along, I obtained
the result of my companion's long gleanings in this fruitful land
of romance and superstition.</p>

<p class="indent">"First," said he, "with regard to the name<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
of this celebrated mountain. Some have thought that it obtained the designation of
Mount Pilate from a tradition of its having been formerly peopled by a
band of Roman deserters, who sought refuge among its almost inaccessible
rocks,&mdash;the Latin word <i>pila</i> having been often used to signify
a mountain-pass; others, that it is a corruption from <i>pileus</i>, a hat,
because its bald summit is often covered by a complete cap of clouds,&mdash;and
hence the old proverb so often quoted in this country,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Quand Pilate a mis son chapeau,</span>
<span class="i1">Le temps sera serein et beau.'</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p class="indent">But the explanation drawing most largely upon the liberal
credulity of the simple inhabitants of the Underwald, and therefore sure to be
the best received, is the following amusing fable:</p>

<p class="indent">"Pontius Pilate having been condemned to death for
his crimes, to avert the shame of a public execution, committed suicide. His
body being found, was by the enraged multitude fastened to an immense
weight of stones, and thrown into the Tyber. But the spirit
of that noble river, outraged by her waters being made the deposit of
so foul a carcase, from that hour rose in foam and torrent to resent
the injury; and, interesting great Nature in her behalf, the most
frightful storms and whirlwinds, with hail, thunder, and lightning,
ravaged the whole country from the Mediterranean shores to the opposite
Adriatic; nor did the elemental uproar cease until the terrified
inhabitants, by dint of the greatest exertions, dragged the body up
again, and in all haste caused it to be conveyed as far as Vienne in
Dauphiny, and there anew committed to the deep.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
But what was the consequence? The Rhone would no more suffer such an
insult than had the Tyber; and its blue waters, swelling with the indignity
offered them, overflowed their natural banks, and rushed with headlong
rapidity, as if to fly the spot of pollution. No bark could live an
instant on the tremendous waves, which now so frightfully disguised
this hitherto calmly majestic stream; and the Dauphinois, like the
Romans, had no remedy for the crying evil, but, as they had done, to
rid themselves and their river of such an ill-omened guest. This was
at length accomplished: but the noble Rhone, although cleansed of
his 'filthy bargain,' could not so easily forget the deep affront; and
yearly, at that very season, he has ever since marked his undying
resentment by a repetition of the same angry demonstrations. Meantime
the offending cause of all this tribulation was secretly transported
to Lausanne, and there condemned to a third watery grave. Why a
preference so little flattering was given to this beautiful spot, is not
known; but certain it is that its inhabitants, being made acquainted
with the new arrival, presaged but little good to their '<i>placid Leman</i>'
from so confirmed a disturber of the silent waters, and before his presence
could have time to create its usual uproar, and thus prevent or
impede such a measure, the body was once more brought to land;
and, a council being held, it was then determined that a small and
isolated lake,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
situated near the summit of the Frakmont, should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>
the chosen place of interment. Being situated at a good forty leagues
from their city, they would at least have little to dread from his future
operations; and the bleak and barren nature of the soil surrounding
his new residence would, as they hoped, neutralize, if not entirely
destroy, his baneful influence.</p>

<p class="indent">"There, then, he was finally deposited; but soon this desolate
region, as though doubly cursed by his coming, felt the dire effects of
his sojourn. The lake itself turned black; and its surrounding shores,
infected by the noxious vapours which it now emitted, could no
longer yield a wholesome herbage, but became one huge and marshy
swamp, where the rankest weeds alone could thrive. The surface of
the water was covered with the blanched bodies of its finny inhabitants;
the water-fowl that used to haunt its banks no sooner came
within its unhealthful precincts than they shared the universal doom,
and fell dead upon the earth; the venomous snake lay stiffening in
the sun, conquered by a superior poison; and the slimy toad expired
in a vain attempt to crawl from an atmosphere too fetid even for his
loathsome nature.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
</p>

<p class="indent">"The peasants, from their hamlets in the neighbouring plains,
had marked the striking change in the appearance of the mountain's top,
which, instead of standing out clear against the blue sky, was almost
always enveloped in a shroudy mist, or, if for a short period it could rid
itself of that encumbrance, still appeared like a heavy blot upon the surface
of the earth, reflecting no single ray of that bright sun which beamed
on all around it. Convinced that such a sudden change could proceed
but from some supernatural cause, a thousand speculations were hazarded
as to what was actually going on at the summit itself; and at length
one among them, more hardy than the rest, set out, determined to explore
the mystery. His presumption, however, was awfully punished;
for although, by dint of an extraordinary courage, he returned to his
anxious friends, yet the sights he had seen, the fright he had endured,
and the bodily exertions he had used to quicken his descent, were too
much for him. It was permitted only that he should relate to the
throng crowding around him the pestilent appearances of the once
beautiful little lake, and then ague-fits, convulsions, and a raging
fever ended the poor wretch's mortal struggles.</p>

<p class="indent">"Whether the circumstances of this intrusive visit added
fresh fuel to the demon's rage, or whether the moment was now come when,
having no longer within his reach any living object on which to vent
his diabolical vengeance, he became impatient of his watery incarceration,
certain it is that, from the very day of the luckless villager's
return, new sounds and sights of horror and desolation startled the
whole country around. A hollow rumbling noise, as of distant thunder
or a smothered volcano, issued, with scarcely a minute's intermission,
during the hours of light, from the mountain's summit; while the
deep silence of midnight was suddenly broken by shrieks and yells so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span>
hideous and piercing, that, compared with them, the war-whoop of a
whole nation of Whyndots or Cherokees would have seemed soft
music. Thus were announced to the affrighted listeners the terrific
struggles then making by the foul spirit to burst his liquid bonds. At
length, one luckless morn, he succeeded in his attempt to breathe
again the free air; and his first feat was to celebrate the unholy triumph
by a storm that hid the sun's face from the world during eight
and forty hours, being the exact number of days of his forced sojourn in the lake.</p>

<p class="indent">"It seemed, from his remaining afterwards on this bleak
and desolate station, either that his infernal art could not compass his entire
removal from the mountain, or that he preferred it to the low grounds
on account of the advantage which its elevated situation gave him to
direct the tempests, and with greater certainty to launch the fires
of destruction upon those particular parts of the country from which
he was at the moment pleased to select his victims. Whichever of
these was the cause of his stay, he, at any rate, by force, or by choice,
did remain there for some hundreds of years; during the whole of
which period he continued more or less, and by every means within
his fell power, to vent his undying rage upon the hapless peasantry
and their little possessions. In the midst of the most terrific of the
storms with which it was his custom to visit the valleys below, the
phantom himself would sometimes be for a moment visible to one or
other of the terror-struck shepherds, and then some dreadful mortality
among his flocks and herds was sure to be the lot of the luckless
wight by whom the apparition had been seen.</p>

<p class="indent">"Once, during a dreadful hurricane that tore up the largest
trees by the roots, and scattered ruin and dismay abroad, the grisly fiend
was plainly seen perched upon the very highest pinnacle of his rocky
dominion, in desperate conflict with a second unearthly being, who,
by the violent gesticulations displayed on both sides, could be no
other than his once mortal enemy, the renowned King Herod. In
short, nothing could exceed either in variety or extent, the mischief
caused to the pastoral inhabitants of the two cantons of Lucerne and
Underwald by this '<i>Lord of the Black Mountain</i>,' the name by which
their demoniac tormentor was universally known. It gave them,
therefore, joy beyond expression when their good genius at last sent
them some hope of deliverance from the evil power, in the person of
a pious and learned doctor, who, being informed of the devastation,
agreed to try conclusions with the imp of Satan. This champion in
the good cause was a celebrated brother of the Rosy Cross, who had
already taken the highest degrees in the university of Salamanca, and
who, having dived deeper than his fellow students into the mysteries
of the far-famed Bactrian sage, possessed a reputation that placed
him almost on a level with Zoroaster himself. Like a good alchymist,
gold was the ultimate object of his philosophical researches; and for a
sufficient sum, (to obtain which many a poor peasant was deprived of
his last kreutzer,) he undertook to rid the country of what had been
so long a scourge to it.</p>

<p class="indent">"He set out accordingly for the conflict; but alone and
unarmed, having refused all aid or guidance but such as his sacred mission
and his hidden knowledge gave him. The combat was long and obstinate,
but never for a moment doubtful. Arrived at the mountain's summit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
the Rosicrucian took up his station on a commanding point of the
rock, and called upon the phantom to appear before him. This simple
summons remaining unnoticed, he proceeded to a display of his cabalistic
powers, and finally brought the stubborn offender into his presence;
but not until the force of his mystic conjurations had torn the
huge fragment on which he stood from its solid base, and left it
balancing on a mere point, where, indeed, it may to this day be seen,
a trembling memento of that awful hour.</p>

<p class="indent">"Unable to make head against the superior prowess of
his opponent, the malignant spirit sought safety in flight but was pursued
by the victorious astrologer, who, coming up with him again on the part
of the mountain now called the Hill of Widerfield, renewed the contest
with fresh vigour; and so furious were the attack and defence on
this spot, and so violent the arts of exorcism to which the reverend
champion had recourse, that the grass beneath their feet was burnt
up as by the fire of heaven, and has never since recovered from the
unnatural blight. Success at length crowned the efforts of the holy
father, who, however, was forced to consent to a sort of honourable
capitulation on the part of the vanquished. It was therefore finally
agreed between them, that the spectre should return to his watery
sepulchre, there to remain inactive during three hundred and sixty-four
days in every year. On Good Friday alone he was to be permitted
to walk abroad, clothed in those magisterial robes which he
was wont to wear when living; even then, however, pledging himself
not to overstep the limits of the mountain's summit, and never, unless
provoked by previous violence or insult, to do harm to aught that had existence.</p>

<p class="indent">"This settled, he mounted a coal-black charger, which,
as a ratification of their solemn treaty, was presented to him by his conqueror,
and which on starting struck his hoof into the neighbouring rock, and
left to all eternity its huge print there. Then, with a noise that
resembled the hissing of an army of serpents, he plunged into the
lake and disappeared; nor has he ever since been known to violate
the engagements then incurred by showing himself to the world, save
on the anniversary of the day above mentioned, or when irritated
beyond his bearing by the language of abuse or some overt act of
aggression, such as the throwing of stones or other substances into
his prison-lake. The treaty thus broken, he has never failed to exercise
the power still left him, and to evince his anger by some terrific
storm or inundation, which would shortly after, and generally in the
very midst of the brightest and clearest weather, suddenly proclaim
his sense of the insult offered him.</p>

<p class="indent">"In consequence of these infractions, by the ignorant

<p class="indent">"Things remained nearly in this state until the event of
the Reformation; after which both Catholic and Protestant united to remove
from the minds of the vulgar, prejudices which ages of ignorant habits
had tended to fix on them. Among the rest, in the year 1585, one
Muller, the curé of Lucerne, having appointed a day for that purpose,
and invited all who were willing so to do to accompany him, set
out on an expedition to the summit of Mount Pilate, and was followed
thither by some hundreds of his parishioners. Arrived at the so
much dreaded lake itself, he proceeded to throw into it, stones, blocks
of wood, and missiles of various descriptions, accompanying the action
with words the most likely to provoke the wrath of the redoubted fiend;
but, to the surprise of the assembled multitude, who had beheld with
affright the audacious ceremony, all remained silent,&mdash;neither sound
nor sight replied to the daring invocation, and the sky was not in
consequence overcast by a single cloud. In order to follow up the partial
light which he had thus let in upon the darkness of ages, the
worthy curé soon afterwards obtained an order from the government
of Lucerne, authorizing the draining of the lake itself,&mdash;a work which
was actually begun in the year 1594, but to which a want of the necessary
funds, and other minor causes, put a stop before it could be
entirely accomplished."</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">I have thus repeated at some length the fabulous
histories which I that day learned during our long and laborious ascent to the
summit of the mountain in question; and I will now only add, that the various
scenes therein alluded to, as having been the theatre of the phantom's
exploits, were pointed out to me by my companion; nor could I avoid
perceiving, by the fondness with which he dwelt rather upon the
superstition itself, than such refutation as followed it, that he
was himself in no slight degree tinged with the popular belief.</p>

<h2>GLORVINA, THE MAID OF MEATH.</h2>
<p class="f110 space-below1">BY JAMES SHERIDAN KNOWLES.</p>

<p class="indent">Ireland has had her heroines. Glorvina, the daughter of
Malachi, king of Meath, was the joy and pride of her father, yet at the same
time his anxious, never-resting care; for the Dane was in the
land. The rovers were led by Turgesius, a voluptuous prince, though
advanced in years. Turgesius approached the gate of Malachi with
the smile of peace upon his countenance, but with the thoughts of
rapine in his heart. He was hospitably received; the banquet was
spread for him; and when he was weary with feasting and hilarity, he
was conducted to the richest, softest couch.</p>

<p class="indent">He had not yet seen Glorvina, but he had heard of her
surpassing beauty; and one day he requested of the king that his daughter
should sit at the feast. A shade came over the brow of Malachi; but he
bowed his head, and it was gone. With a timid, yet stately step, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
virgin entered the hall. Thick and clustering, and reaching far below
her tapering waist, hung her auburn hair; her eyes were cast down;
her fair skin mantled and faded, as her colour came and went; and
she spake not as she sank in modest, graceful obeisance, to the
salutation of Turgesius.</p>

<p class="indent">The Dane had no appetite for the banquet that day. He
seemed to be conscious of nothing but the presence of Glorvina. Alarm and
ire were painted in the countenance of the king, but Turgesius noted
it not. He never removed his eyes from the royal maid; they wandered
incessantly over her features and her form, and followed the
movements of her white, roundly-moulded arms, as she accepted or
returned the cup or the viands which were proffered for her use.
Haughty for the first time was the fair brow of Glorvina: the bold
stare of man was a stranger to her. Again and again she offered to
retire, but was withheld by the dissuasions of Turgesius, seconded by
the admonishing glances of her father. At last, however, in spite of
all opposition, she withdrew.</p>

<p class="indent">The Dane sat abstracted with a clouded brow; deep
sighs came thick and strugglingly from his breast. Malachi tried to rouse
his guest, and succeeded at last, with the aid of the cup. Turgesius
waxed wildly joyous; he spoke of love, and of the idol before which
the passion bows; and he asked for the strain that was in unison with
the tone of his soul; the song of desire was awakened at his call;
and as it flowed, swelling and sinking with the mood of the fitful
theme, the rover's cheek flushed more and more, and his eyes more
wildly flamed.</p>

<p class="indent">Turgesius did not sleep at the castle that night. He was
summoned on a sudden to a distance: oppression had produced reaction.
In the place of the slave, the man had started up; and the air all at
once was thick with weapons, where for months the glare of brass or
of steel had not been seen, except in the hand of the foreigner.
Outposts had been driven in; large bands were retracing steps which
they had no right to take; the sway of the freebooter was tottering.
His presence saved it, and the native again bowed sullenly to resume
the yoke.</p>

<p class="indent">After the lapse of a few weeks, Turgesius once more drew
near the gate of Malachi. Loudly the blast of his herald demanded the
customed admission, and with impatience the Dane awaited the reply to
his summons. It came; but there was wailing in the voice of welcome,
and the visitor felt that he grew cold. The mourner received
him in the hall:&mdash;Glorvina was no more! Turgesius turned his face
away from the house of death, and departed for his own stronghold,
where with alternate sports and revels he endeavoured to assuage
disappointment and obliterate recollection.</p>

<p class="indent">Dusk fell. Silent and gloomy was the aisle of the royal
chapel. Before a monument, newly erected, stood a lonely figure gazing upon
the name of Glorvina, which was carved upon the stone. The figure
was that of a youth, tall, and of matchless symmetry. His arms were
folded, his head drooped, he uttered no sound; his soul was with the
inmate of the narrow house. He heard not the step of the bard who
was approaching, and who presently stood by his side unnoted by him.</p>

<p class="indent">Long did the reverend man gaze upon the youth without
attempting to accost him. More and more he wondered who it could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>
whom sorrow so enchained in abstraction. At length the lips of the
figure moved, and a sigh, deep-drawn, ushered forth the name of
Glorvina. No stranger to the bard was the voice that fell upon his
ear. "Niall!" he exclaimed. The youth started and turned; it
<i>was</i> Niall. He threw himself upon the neck of the bard. The flood
of the eyes began to flow: he sobbed forth aloud and incontinently
the name of Glorvina!</p>

<p class="indent">"Niall," said the bard, as soon as the paroxysm of grief had
a little subsided,&mdash;"Niall, you are changed in form, your stature has shot
up, your shoulders have spread, and your chest has rounded. Your features,
too, I can see by this spare light, have received from manhood
a stamp which they did not bear before; but your heart, my son, is
the same. Niall in his affections has come back what he went. The
Saxon has not changed him, nor the Saxon's daughter; her golden
hair has waved before his eyes, her skin of pearl has shone upon them,
the silver harp of her voice has streamed upon his ear; but his heart
hath been still with Glorvina!"</p>

<p class="indent">"To what end?" passionately burst forth the youth. "Glorvina is
in the tomb!" The tears gushed again; the bard was silent.</p>

<p class="indent">"Where is your prophetic Psalter?" resumed Niall; "where
is it? Who will give credence to it now? Did you not say that Glorvina
was the fair maid of Meath by whom it foretold that the land was to
be rescued from the Dane; and that I was that son of my house who
should be joined with her in perilous, yet happy wedlock? This did
you not say and repeat a thousand times?&mdash;Then why do I look upon
that tomb?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Niall," said the bard, "have faith, though you look upon
the tomb of Glorvina!" The youth shook his head.&mdash;"Have you yet seen the
king?" inquired the bard. Niall replied in the negative. "Come,
then, young man, and look upon a father's grief!"</p>

<p class="indent">The bard led the way towards the closet of the king.
The light of the taper streamed from the half-open door: and as Niall, by the
side of the bard, stood in the comparative darkness of the ante-chamber,
he stared upon the face of Malachi, bright with a smile at a
false move at chess which a person with whom the king was playing
had just that moment made. Niall could scarce believe his
vision.&mdash;"Where is the grief of the father?" whispered he to the bard.</p>

<p class="indent">"Note on!" was the old man's reply.</p>

<p class="indent">"He laughs!" exclaimed Niall, almost loud enough to be heard
by those within.&mdash;"Yes," said the bard; "he who wins may laugh. He
has got the game."</p>

<p class="indent">"And where is his child?" ejaculated Niall with a groan so
audible that Malachi heard it and started; but the bard hurried the
youth from the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Niall and the bard sat alone in the apartment of the latter.
Sparingly the youth partook of the repast, which was presently removed.
He sat silent, leaning his head upon his hand. At length he lifted
his eyes to the face of the bard; it was smiling like the king's, as he
played the game of chess. The young man stared; the bard smiled on.</p>

<p class="indent">"A strain!" cried the reverend man, and took his harp
and tuned it, and tried the chords till every string had its proper tone.
"Now!" he exclaimed, ready to begin. The young man watched the waking of
the lay, which he expected would be in unison with the mood of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>
soul: but, lo! note rapidly followed note in mirthful chase, still
quickening to the close; and the countenance of Niall, overcast before
with grief, now lowered with anger.</p>

<p class="indent">"I list not strain like that!" he exclaimed, starting from his seat.</p>

<p class="indent">"You list no other, boy, from me," rejoined the old man; "it is
your welcome home."&mdash;"My home," ejaculated Niall, "is the tomb
where Glorvina sleeps the sleep of death!"</p>

<p class="indent">"The Psalter," said the old man solemnly, "is the promise of
Destiny, and is sure to be fulfilled."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, then," asked the youth sternly,&mdash;"why, then, is
Glorvina no longer among the living?&mdash;Why in the place of her glowing cheek do
I meet the tomb?&mdash;the silence of death, instead of her voice?"</p>

<p class="indent">The bard made no reply, but leaned over his harp again,
and spanned its golden strings. He sang of the chase. The game was a
beauteous hind; eager was the hunter, but too swift was her light
foot for his wish. She distanced him like the wind, which at one
moment brushes the cheek, and the next will be leagues away; and
now she was safe, pressing the mossy sward in the region of the
mountain and the lake, where the waters mingle and spread one
silvery sheet for the fair tall heavens to look into.</p>

<p class="indent">Niall sat amazed!&mdash;conjecture and doubt seemed to
divide his soul. He sprang towards the old man, and, throwing himself at his feet,
snatched the hand that still lay upon the strings and caught it to his
bosom. Yet he spake not, save by his eyes; in the intense expression
of which, inquiry, and entreaty, and deprecation were mingled.</p>

<p class="indent">The old man rose and stood silent for a time, looking down
benevolently upon Niall, who seemed scarcely to breathe, watching the lips
that he felt were about to move.</p>

<p class="indent">"Niall," at length said the bard,&mdash;"Niall, the strength
of the day is the rest of night. Fair upon the eye of the sleeper, awakening him,
breaks the light of morning. Then he springs from his couch,
and stretches his limbs, and braces them, eager for action; and he
asks who will go with him to the field of the feat; or haply betakes
him to the road to try his strength alone; and following it through
hill and valley, moor and mead, suddenly shows his triumph-shining
face to the far friend that looked not for him!"</p>

<p class="indent">The bard ceased. Both he and the youth remained motionless
for several seconds, intently regarding one another. At last Niall sprang
upon his feet, and threw himself upon the neck of the old man, whose
arms simultaneously closed around the boy.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">"You will sleep to-night, my son," said the bard,
withdrawing himself at length from the embrace of Niall. "The dawn shall not come
to thy casement before thou shalt hear my summons at thy door.
Good-night!" They parted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent space-above1">By the side of a bright river strayed hand in hand
two young females, seemingly rustics. Rain had fallen. The thousand torrents of
the mountains were in play; and the general waters, swoln beyond
the capacity of their customed channel, ran hurried and ruffled.</p>

<p class="indent">"Who would think," remarked the younger of the two,&mdash;"who
would think that this was the river we saw yesterday?"</p>

<p class="indent">"'Tis changed indeed," said her companion; "but the
sky that was lowering yesterday, you see, is bright and serene to-day. Did you
hear the storm in the night?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"No: I would I had. It would have saved me from a dream
darker than any storm."</p>

<p class="indent">"A dream!&mdash;Tell it me. I am a reader of dreams."</p>

<p class="indent">"You know," began the younger,&mdash;"you know I was
brought up with the only son of a distant branch of my father's house. I know
not how it was, but, from my earliest recollection, my foster-mother,
and others as well as she, set me down for his wife; and, strangely
enough, I fancied myself so. Yet could it be nothing more than a
sister's love that I bore him. Much he used to make of me. His
pastime&mdash;even his studies&mdash;were regulated by my will. Being older
than I, he let me play the fool to the very height of my caprice,
which cost me many a chiding,&mdash;but not from him, though he had to
bear the greater portion of the consequences. You know by his
father's will he was enjoined to travel the last four years preceding
his majority. He set out the very day that I completed my fourteenth
year. I wish it had been before. I should have felt the separation
less, for indeed it cost me real agony. For months after,
they would catch me weeping: they did not know the cause; but
'twas for him! Still I only loved him as a brother&mdash;but a dear one,&mdash;Oh,
Myra! I cannot tell you how dear!&mdash;and absence has not abated
my feelings, as you may more than guess by my dream last night."</p>

<p class="indent">"Look!" interrupted the other; "see you not some one
through the interval of the trees descending yonder road that winds round
the foot of the nearest mountain?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No," replied the former, after she had looked in the
direction a moment or two. "But attend to my dream. I thought I was married
indeed, and that he was my husband; and that we were sitting
at the bridal feast, placed on each side of my father; and there were
the viands, and the wine, and the company, and everything as plain
as you are that are standing there before me; when, all at once&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I see him again!" a second time interrupted the friend. "Look!
don't you catch the figure?"&mdash;"No."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then you'll not catch it at all now, for he has dived into the
wood through which the road runs."</p>

<p class="indent">"Was it a single person?"&mdash;"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then we have nothing to care for;
so don't interrupt me in my dream again."</p>

<p class="indent">"Go on with it," said the other.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well; we were sitting, as I said, at the bridal feast,
when, turning to speak to my father, the fiery eyes of one I hope never
to see again were glaring on me, and my father was gone; and fierce men,
with gleaming weapons waving above their heads, surrounded him to
whom I had just pledged my troth, and bore him, in spite of his
struggles and my screams, away: leaving me to the mercy of the
spoiler, who straight, methought, started up with the intent of
dragging me to the couch which had been prepared for another!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do you mark," interrupted the friend, "as you increase
in loudness, the echoes waken? I heard the last word repeated as distinctly
as you yourself uttered it. But go on. Yet beware these echoes;
they may be tell-tales. What followed?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, what harrows my soul even now! Thither, where
I told you, did he try to force me, struggling with all my might to resist
him. I called on my father,&mdash;I called on my bridegroom,&mdash;I called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>
on every one I could think of; but no one came to me, and fast we
approached the door, on the threshold of which to have died, I
thought in my dream, would be bliss to the horror of crossing it, and
there at last we stood: but it was shut. Yet soon it moved; and
who think you it was that opened it? Niall!&mdash;Niall himself! and
no resistance did he offer to him that forced me onward,&mdash;none,
though I called to him by his name, shrieking it louder than I am
speaking now, 'Niall!&mdash;Niall!' He spoke not,&mdash;he moved not; and
I was within a foot of the very couch, when I awoke, my face bathed
in the dew of terror. 'Niall!&mdash;Niall!' did I cry, did I shriek; and
Niall was there, and I shrieked in vain&mdash;'Niall!&mdash;Niall!'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Here!" cried Niall himself, springing from a copse, out
of which led a path that made a short cut across an angle of the road, and
throwing himself breathless at the feet of Glorvina.</p>

<p class="indent">The astonished maid stood motionless, gazing on the young
man, who remained kneeling, until her companion, taking her hand, and calling
her by her name, aroused her from the trance of astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">"Come," said Myra, "let us return;" and, motioning to
the young man to follow them, she led her passive companion back to the
lonely retreat whither Malachi had transported his fair child.</p>

<p class="indent">Glorvina did not perfectly recover her self-possession
till she arrived at the door. Then she stopped, and turning, bent her
bright gaze full upon the wondering Niall, who moved not another step.</p>

<p class="indent">"Niall&mdash;if you are Niall&mdash;" said the maid. She
paused, and a sigh passed, in spite of them, the lips that would have kept it
in: "If you are the Niall," she resumed, "to whom I said farewell four years
ago, the day and the hour are not unwelcome that bring back, in
health, and strength, and happiness, the playmate of our childhood
to the land of his fathers; and we bless God that he has suffered
them to shine. But why comes Niall hither? Who taught him to
doubt the testimony of the tomb? Who directed his steps to the
solitudes of the mountains, the woods, and the lakes? Who cried,
"God speed!" when his heel left the home of my father behind it?
Was it the master of that home?&mdash;was it Malachi, my father?"</p>

<p class="indent">A thought that had not occurred to him before, seemed
suddenly to cross the mind of Niall. His lips that would have spoken remained
motionless, his cheek coloured, his eye fell to the feet of Glorvina; he
stood confounded and abashed.</p>

<p class="indent">"'Tis well!" cried the stately maid. "The tongue of Niall
is yet unacquainted with falsehood, though his feet may be no strangers to
the steps of rashness. The repast is spread; enter and partake!" and
she paused for a second or two. Niall slowly lifted his eyes till they
met those of Glorvina; apprehension and supplication mingled in the
gaze of the youth. At length, with a tone that spoke at once compassion
and resolve, the word "Depart!" found utterance; and the
maid and her companion, stepping aside, left the entrance of their
lonely habitation free, as Niall mechanically passed in.</p>

<p class="indent">A cheerless and disheartening spectacle is a dismasted
ship, with all her mass of wreck still clinging to the hull, that it once
bore proudly over the billows! 'Tis like the unfortunate abandoned by his
friends, who, however, continue to hang around him, though more to
impede his way than to retrieve his fortunes! And there lay the
Spankaway, with her long line of taper spars reversed, their heads in
the water, and their heels uppermost; and, as if in mockery of the
mishap, the beautiful bright moon showed their diminished shadows
on the again smooth surface of the ocean. The squall had passed far
away to leeward, and was dwindling to a mere speck of silvery vapour,
whilst all besides was still, and calm, and passionless.</p>

<p class="indent">Now it was no pleasant sight to Lord Eustace Dash
and his officers to witness the dismantling of the craft they loved; and,
as the chief, it may be naturally supposed that the chagrin of his lordship
far exceeded that of his subs: but there was one amongst them almost
affected to tears, and that was old Will Parallel, the master.</p>

<p class="indent">"Smack smooth to the lower caps, by &mdash;&mdash;!" said
his lordship, as he surveyed the havoc made in his dashing frigate;
"not a rope-yarn above the lower mast-heads, and&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Not a bit of canvass abroad big enough to make a
clout for a babby," chimed in the old master; "spanker, jib, topsels all gone
to the devil, as 'll have no more manner o' use for 'em than
a serjeant of jollies has for a hand-bible."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where's Mr. &mdash;&mdash;?" shouted his lordship, and the master's
mate who had had charge of the deck stood before him. "How came all this, sir?"</p>

<p class="indent">"It was a white squall, my lord," returned the young man
addressed; "not a soul saw it till it caught the ship, and the topmasts went
over the side immediately."</p>

<p class="indent">"I shall inquire into the fact presently, sir," rejoined his lordship,
excessively vexed and mortified. "Turn the hands up&mdash;clear the wreck!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Hands up&mdash;clear the wreck!" shouted the first lieutenant.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hands up&mdash;clear the wreck!" repeated the master's mate.</p>

<p class="indent">"Boatswain's mate, pipe 'Clear the wreck!'" reiterated
the midshipmen. "Twhit! twhit!" went the call; and, "Clear wreck,
a-hoy!" vociferated Jack Sheavehole, in a voice resembling the roar
of the bellows of an anchor-forge. The summons, however, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
hardly necessary, as every soul had <i>tumbled</i> up at the moment the
frigate righted; and all turned to with a hearty goodwill to repair
damages, every officer and man using his best exertions.</p>

<p class="indent">"The squall spoilt our fun, master," said the first lieutenant
to old Parallel, as the latter was superintending the preparations for
unrigging the old, and rigging the new spare topmasts.</p>

<p class="indent">"Ay! ay! 'twas an onfortunate <i>blow</i> to the harmony
of the evening; but it will do for an incident for Nugent," responded the
veteran. "Where's his fine lady curtcheying to herself in a mirror
now? If he had stuck to plain matter-of-fact, mayhap the spars would
have behaved better; though, arter all, it's a marcy they were so
carroty, or mayhap her ladyship might have curtcheyed so low as to
have gone to the bottom."</p>

<p class="indent">That night was a night of arduous but light-hearted toil;
no man shrunk from his task; and, when they piped to breakfast next morning,
the frigate was once more all ataunt'o, with royals and studding-sails
set, in chase of a large ship of warlike appearance that was seen
in the north-west, running away large, apparently bound in for Toulon.</p>

<p class="indent">"Foretopsel-yard, there!" shouted Lord Eustace, from the
quarter-deck. "What do you make of her, Mr. Nugent?"</p>

<p class="indent">"She's nearly end on, my lord," responded the young lieutenant,
as, steadying himself by the topsail-tie, he directed his glass towards
the stranger; and then, in a few minutes, added, "She spreads a broad
cloth, my lord; and, from the cut of her canvass, I should most
certainly say&mdash;&mdash;" and he paused to take another look.</p>

<p class="indent">"I'd take my daffy on it, Mr. Nugent," said the look-out
man, "her topsels are more hollowed out than ourn; her royals never came
out of a British dock-yard; and I'd bet my six months' whack again a
scupper-nail that she's a Frenchman, and a large frigate too."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, what is she, Nugent?" shouted the noble captain.
"Can you see down to her courses!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, my lord," responded the lieutenant; "we shall,
I hope, have her hull in sight before long, as I have no hesitation in
saying&mdash;that is, my lord, I think she's an enemy frigate."</p>

<p class="indent">This annunciation was heard fore and aft; for, during the
time of his lordship hailing, every whisper was hushed, and scarcely even a
limb moved, lest the listener should lose the replies. Expectations
had been raised that the vessel in sight might be a French transport,
from the Egyptian coast, or perhaps a merchantman; but the chance
of an enemy's frigate was indeed joyous news. Breakfast was hastily
despatched; the mess-kits were speedily stowed away,
and the boatswain's shrill call echoed amongst the canvass as he piped
"Make sail, ahoy!" In an instant every man was at his station; every
yard of cloth that could catch a breath of wind was packed upon the
Spankaway, who seemed to glide along through the water just as
easy as when she first started from the buttered slips. Indeed, Jack
Sheavehole declared that "she wur all the better for the spree she'd
had the night afore."</p>

<p class="indent">An exciting period is the time of chase, and it is extremely
interesting to observe the anxious looks of the officers as they eye the
trim of the sails, and the ready attention of the tars as they execute
the most minute command, as if everything depended on their own
individual exertions. The usual routine of duty frequently gives place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
to the all-absorbing stimulus which actuates every mind alike; and,
as the seamen group themselves together, they spin their yarns of
battles and captures, and calculate their share of the amount of
prize-money before they engage the enemy, totally regardless of the advice
in the "Cook's Oracle," viz. "First catch an eel, and then skin him."
But what have they to do with the "Cook's Oracle," when every man
is by rotation cook of the mess in his own natural right, and "gets the
plush (overplus) of grog?"</p>

<p class="indent">All day the chase continued; and the Spankaway overhauled
the stranger so as materially to lessen the distance between them: in
fact, her hull could be plainly discerned from the deck, and there was
no longer any doubt of her national character. In the afternoon permission
was given to take the hammocks below, but not a man availed
himself of it; they were therefore re-stowed in readiness for that
engagement which all hearts were eager for, all hands itching to begin.
Evening closed in, and keen eyes were employed to keep sight
of the enemy. The men lay down at their quarters; some to take a
nigger's sleep,&mdash;one eye shut and the other open; some to converse
in good audible whispers; some leaning out at the ports, and watching
the moonbeams reflected on the waters, whilst the hissing and
chattering noise made by the progress of the ship was sweet music to
their ears.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a lovely night for contemplation,&mdash;but what
did Jack want with contemplation whilst an enemy's frigate was in sight?
The breeze was light enough to please a lady,&mdash;it would have scarcely
vibrated the cords of an Æolian lyre: but this was not the breeze for
our honest tars; they wanted to hear the gale thrilling through the
harpstrings of the standing rigging, with a running accompaniment
of deep bass from the ocean, as their counter, set in sea, trebled the
piping noise of the wind. Yet there was one satisfaction; the Frenchman
had no more than themselves, and they carried every fresh capful
along with them before it reached the chase. The full round
moon tried her best endeavour to make her borrowed radiance equally
as luminous as that of the glorious orb which so generously granted
the loan, with only one provision, that a certain rate of interest
should be paid to the earth; but the old girl on this night tried to
sport the principal. The waters were lucidly clear, and the mimic
waves on its surface would scarcely have been a rough sea to that
model of a Dutch dogger&mdash;a walnut-shell. Yet the Spankaway was
stealing along some seven knots an hour, and the sails just slept a
dreamer's sleep.</p>

<p class="indent">On the forecastle&mdash;that post of honour to a seaman,
where the tallest and the best of Britain's pride are always to be found&mdash;men
who can take the weather-wheel, heave the lead, splice a cable, or
furl a foresail,&mdash;the A. B.'s of the royal navy,&mdash;on the forecastle,
just in amidships, before the mast, sat our old friend, Jack Sheavehole,
Sam Slick, the ship's tailor, Joe Nighthead, Mungo Pearl, a negro
captain of the sweepers, Jemmy Ducks, the poulterer, Bob Martingal,
a forecastleman, and several others, who were stationed at the foremost guns.</p>

<p class="indent">"I just tell you what it is, Jack," said Bob Martingal,
continuing a dispute that had arisen, "I tell you what it is; some on you
is as onbelieving as that 'ere Jew as they've legged down so much again,
and who, they say, is working a traverse all over the world to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
very hour, with a billy-goat's beard afore him as long as a chafing
mat. But, take care, my boyo, you arn't conwincetecated some o'
these here odd times, when you least expects it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Onbelieving about what, Bob?" responded the boatswain's
mate. "Onbelieving 'cause we don't hoist in all your precious tough yarns
as 'ud raise a fellow's hair on eend, and make his head look a mainshroud
dead-eye stuck round with marlin'-spikes?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Or a cushionful of pins," chimed in Sam Slick.</p>

<p class="indent">"Or a duck with his tail up," added the poulterer.</p>

<p class="indent">"Hould your precious tongues, you lubbers!&mdash;what
should you know about the build and rig of a devil's own craft? retorted
Bob, addressing the two officials. "My messmate here, and that's ould
Jack, has got a good and nat'ral right to calculate the jometry of the
thing, seeing as he has sarved his life to the ocean, man and boy, and
knows an eyelet-hole from a goose's gun-room, which, I take it, is
more nor both on you together can diskiver either in the twist of a
button-catcher or the drawing of a pullet. But I'm saying, Jack, you
are onbelieving,&mdash;else why do you misdoubt the woracity of my reckoning."</p>

<p class="indent">"'Cause you pitches it too strong, Bob," answered the
boatswain's mate; "your reck'ning is summut like ould Blowhard's, as keeps
the Duncan's Head at Castle-rag,&mdash;chalks two for one. Spin your yarns
to the marines, Bob; they'll always believe you. Cause why?&mdash;they
expects you'll just hould on by their monkey-tails in return."</p>

<p class="indent">"Monkey-tails or no monkey-tails arn't the question,"
returned Bob with some warmth; "it's the devil's tail as I'm veering away
upon, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I'm blessed if it won't bring you up all standing with a
roundturn round your neck some o' these here days," uttered Jack,
interrupting him.</p>

<p class="indent">"Never mind that," returned Bob with a knowing shake
of the head; "I shall uncoil it again, if he arn't got the king's broad
arrow on the end on it. But mayhap, then, you won't believe as there is
such a justice o' peace as ould Davy?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Do I believe my catechiz as I forgot long ago?" responded
old Jack. "Why, yes, messmate, I wooll believe that there is a consarn
o' the kind; but not such a justice o' peace as you'd make of him,
rigged out in one o' your 'long-shore clargy's sky-scraper shovel-nosed
trucks, leather breeches, and top-boots! I tell you it won't do, Bob,
in the regard o' the jography o' the matter. Why, where the h&mdash;is
he to coil away his outrigger in a pair of tight leather rudder casings
over his starn? Ax the tailor there whether it arn't onpossible.
And how could he keep top-boots on to his d&mdash;d onprincipled shanks,
as are no better in the fashion of their cut than a couple of cow's
trotters? And what single truck would fit two mast-heads at once,
seeing as he al'ays carries a pair of horns as big as a bull's. No, no,
Bob; you wants to make a gentleman of the picarooning wagabone,
when everybody as knows anything about him knows he's a thundering
blagguard, as my ould captain, Sir Joseph Y&mdash;ke, used to say in
one of his beautiful sarmons, 'he goes cruising about seeking to
devour a roaring lion,' and that's no child's play anyhow! But,
howsomever, a yarn's a yarn, ould chap; so lather-away with your oak
stick: I'll hoist in all I can, just to confar a favour on you; and, as
for the rest, why I'll let it go by the run."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"I must crave permission to put in a word, since I have
been professionally appealed to," said Sam Slick with becoming gravity,
and smoothing down the nap of his sleeping-jacket. "With respect to the
breeches,&mdash;wash-leather, after they have been worn for some time,
will give and stretch, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Come, none o' your stretching, Sam," chimed in Jemmy Ducks.
"What you've got to show is, whether you can stow a cable in a hen-coop."</p>

<p class="indent">"Not exactly," returned Sam; "for I'm sure Mister Sheavehole
must allow that the capacity and capability of a pair of leather breeches&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"I shan't never allow no such consarns as them 'ere!" exclaimed
Jack. "Do, Bob, get on with your yarn, and clap a stopper on the lubber's jawing-gear."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, since you've put me upon it by misdoubting my woracity,"
said Bob, "why, I'll up and tell you a thing or two.
Which on you has ever been down to Baltimore?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I have," returned a forecastleman, impatient to wedge
in a word or two. "I was there onest in a ship transport, and our jolly-boat
broke adrift in the night, and went ashore without leave; and so, next
morning, we sees her lying on the beach all alone, as if she'd been a
liberty-boy hard up in the regard o' the whiskey. And so the second
mate and a party goes to launch her: but some wild Ingines, only
they warn't quite black, came down, and wouldn't let us lay a finger
on her till we'd paid summut for hauling her up, which was all nat'ral
in course; but the second mate hadn't never got not a single copper
whatsomever about him, and so he orders us to launch her whether or
no, Tom Collins; and, my eyes! but they did kick up a shindy, jabbering
in a lingo like double Dutch coiled again the sun; and says
one on 'em, seeing as we were man-handling the boat, says he, 'Arrah,
Tim, call to de boys to bring down de shticks&mdash;&mdash; '"</p>

<p class="indent">"You means Baltimore in Ireland," uttered Bob, with some
degree of contempt, "and I means Baltimore in the United States o' Maryland,
where the river runs along about three leagues out of Chesapeake
Bay,&mdash;and a pretty place it is too of a Saturday night for a bit
of a John Canooing, and a bite of pigtail, letting alone the grog and
the gals&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Which you never did, Bob, I'll be sworn," said Jack laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">"Never did what, Jack?" asked the other, apparently surprised at
the positive assertion.</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, let the grog and the gals alone, God A'mighty bless both
on 'em!" replied the boatswain's mate; "but heave a-head, my hearty."</p>

<p class="indent">Bob gave a self-satisfied grin, and proceeded. "Why, d'ye
mind, I'd been fool enough to grease my heels from a hooker,&mdash;no matter
whatsomever her name might be or where she sailed from, seeing as
she carried a coach-whip at her main-truck and a rogue's yarn in her
standing and running gear. But I was young and foolish, and my
brains hadn't come to their proper growth; and one o' your land-sharks
had got a grip o' me; and there I was a-capering ashore, and
jumping about like a ring-tail monkey over a hot plantain; and so
I brings up at the sign of the General Washingtub, and there used to
be a lot of outrageous tarnation swankers meet there for a night's
spree,&mdash;fellows as carried bright marlin'-spikes in their pockets for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
toothpicks, and what not, and sported Spanish dollars on their jackets
for buttons. They belonged to a craft as laid in the harbour,&mdash;a
reg'lar clipper, all legs and wings: she had a white cherry-bum for a
figure-head; ounly there was a couple o' grease-horns sprouting out
on the forehead, and she was as pretty a piece of timber upon the
water as ever was modelled by the hand of the devil."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, how do you know who moulded her frame, Bob?"
inquired Jack provokingly. "It might have been some honest man's son,
instead of the ould chap as you mentions. But if any one sees a
beautiful hooker that's more beautifuller nor another, then she's
logged down as the devil's own build, and rigged by the captain of the sweepers."</p>

<p class="indent">"Wharra you mean by dat, Massa Jack?" exclaimed Mungo
Pearl, who held that honourable station, and felt his dignity offended
by the allusion; "wharra you mean by dat, eh?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Just shut your black-hole," answered Jack with a knowing
look; "don't the ould witches ride upon birch-brooms, and sweep through
the air,&mdash;and arn't the devil their commander-in-chief? Well, then,
in course he is captain o' the sweepers. But go along, Bob. I'll lay
my allowance o' grog to-morrow she was painted black."</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, so she was, Jack," responded Martingal, "all but
a narrow fiery red ribbon round her sides, as looked for all the world
like a flash o' lightning darting out of a thunder-cloud; and her name was
the In-fun-oh (Infernaux), but I'm d&mdash;d if there was any fun in the
consarn arter all. Well, d'ye see, the hands were a jolly jovial set,
with dollars as plentiful as boys' dumps, and they pitched 'em away
at the lucky, and made all sneer again. The skipper was a civil-spoken
gentleman, with a goodish-sized ugly figure-head of his own,
one eye kivered over with a black patch, and the other summut like a
stale mackerel's; but it never laid still, and was al'ays sluing round
and round, 'cause it had to do double duty. Still he was a pleasantish
sort of a chap, and had such a 'ticing way with him, that when
he axed me to ship in the craft, I'm blow'd if I could say 'No,'
though I felt summut dubersome about the consarn; and the more in
regard of an ould tar telling me the black patch was all a sham, but
he was obliged to kiver the eye up, 'cause it was a ball o' fire
as looked like a glowing cinder in a fresh breeze. He'd sailed with
him a voyage or two, and he swore that he had often seen the skipper
clap his cigar under the false port and light it by his eye; and one night
in a gale o' wind, when the binnacle-lamp couldn't be kept burning, he
steered the ship a straight course by the compass from the brightness
of his eye upon the card. Howsomever, I didn't much heed to all that
'ere, seeing as I knowed how to spin a tough yarn myself: and then
there was the grog and the shiners, a sweet ship and civil dealing;
and I'll just ax what's the use o' being nice about owners, as long as
you do what's right and ship-shape? 'Still, messmate,' thinks I to
myself, 'it's best not to be too much in a hurry;' so I backs and fills,
just dropping with the tide of inclination, and now and then letting go
the kedge o' contradiction to swing off from the shore; and at last I tould
him 'I'd let him know next day.' Well, I goes to the ould tar as I mentioned
afore, and I tells him all about it. 'Don't go for to sign articles
in no such a craft as that 'ere,' says he in a moloncholy way.&mdash;'Why
not?' says I, quite gleesome and careless, though there was a summut
that comothered me all over when he spoke.&mdash;'I mustn't tell you,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span>
says he; 'but take my advice, and never set foot on board a craft
that arn't got no 'sponsible owners,' says he.&mdash;'You must tell me more
nor that,' says I, 'or you may as well tell me nothing. You've been
to sea in her, and are safe enough; why shouldn't I?'&mdash;'I advise you
for your good,' says he again, all fatherlike and gently; 'you can do
as you please. You talk of my safety,' and he looked cautiously
round him; 'but it's the parsen as has
done it for me.'&mdash;'Oh! I see how the land lies,' says I; 'you're a bit
of a methodish, and so strained the yarns o' your conscience, 'cause you
made a trip to the coast o' Guinea for black wool.'&mdash;He shook his head:
'Black wool, indeed,' says he; 'but no man as knows what I knows would
ever lay hand to sheet home a topsel for a commander who &mdash;&mdash;' and he
brought up his speech all standing.&mdash;'Who what?' axes I; but he
wouldn't answer: and so, being a little hopstropulous in my mind,
and willing to try the hooker, 'It's no matter,' says I, 'I'll have a shy
at her if I loses my beaver. No man can expect to have the devil's
luck and his own too.'&mdash;'That's it!' says he, starting out like a dogvane
in a sudden puff.&mdash;'That's what?' axes I.&mdash;'The devil's luck!'
says he: 'don't go for to ship in that craft. She's handsome to look
at; but, like a painted scullerpar, or sea-poll-ker, or some such name,
she's full o' dead men's bones.'&mdash;'Gammon!' says I boldly with my
tongue, though I must own, shipmates, there was summut of a flusteration
in my heart as made me rather timbersome; 'Gammon!' says
I, 'what 'ud they do with such a cargo even in a slaver?'&mdash;'I sees
you're wilful,' says he angrily; 'but log this down in your memory:
if you do ship in that 'ere craft, you'll be d&mdash;d!'&mdash;'Then I'll be
d&mdash;d if I don't:' says I, 'and so, ould crusty-gripes, here goes;' and
away I started down to one of the keys just to take a look at her
afore I entered woluntary; and there she lay snoozing as quiet as a cat
on a hearth-rug, or a mouse in the caulker's oakum. Below, she was
as black as the ace o' spades, and almost as sharp in the nose; but,
aloft, her white tapering spars showed like a delicate lady's fingers in
silk-net gloves&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Or holding a skein of silk," chimed in Sam Slick.</p>

<p class="indent">"Well, shipmates," continued Bob; "whilst I was taking
a pretty long eye-drift over her hull and rigging, and casting my thoughts
about the skipper, somebody taps me on the arm, and when I slued
round, there he was himself, <i>in properer personnee</i>; and, 'Think o'
the devil,' says I, 'and he's over your shoulder, saving your honour's
presence, and I hopes no offence.' Well, I'm blessed but his eye&mdash;that's
his onkivered one, messmates&mdash;twinkled and scaled over dark
again, just for all the world like a revolving light, and 'Not no offence
at all, my man,' says he; 'it's al'ays best to be plain-spoken
in such consarns; we shall know one another better by-and-by. But
how do you like the ship?'&mdash;'She's a sweet craft, your honour,' says
I; 'and I should have no objection to a good berth on board her, provided
we can come to reg'lar agreement.'&mdash;'We shall not quarrel, I
dare say, my man,' says he, quite cool and insinivating; 'my people
never grumble with their wages, and you see yourself they wants for
nothing.'&mdash;'All well and good, your honour,' says I; 'and, to make
short of the long of it, Bob Martingal's your own.' Well, his eye
twinkled again, and there seemed to be such a heaving and setting
just under the tails of his long togs, and a sort o' rustling down one
leg of his trousers, that blow me if I could tell what to make on it;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span>
and 'I knew you'd be mine,' says he: 'we shall go to sea in the
morning, so you'd better get your traps aboard as soon as possible.'
Well, messmates, I bids him good morning; but, thinks I to myself,
I'll just take a bit of a overhaul of the craft afore I brings my duds
aboard; and so, jumping into a punt, a black fellow pulls me alongside,
and away I goes on to the deck, and there the first person I seed was
the skipper. How he came there was a puzzler, for d&mdash;the boat had
left the key but our own since we parted a few minutes afore. 'And
now, Bob,' says he, 'I suppose you are ready to sign.'&mdash;'All in good
time, your honour,' says I. 'You're aboard afore me, but I'm blessed
if I seed you come.'&mdash;'It warn't necessary you should,' says he; 'my
boat travels quick, my man, and makes short miles.'&mdash;'All's the same
for that, your honour,' says I, 'whether you man your barge or float
off on the anchor-stock&mdash;it's all as one to Bob.'&mdash;'You're a 'cute
lad,' says he, twinkling his eye, 'and must rise in the sarvice. Go
below and visit your future shipmates.'&mdash;'Thanky, your honour,' says
I, and down the hatchway I goes; and there were the messes, with
fids o' roast beef and boiled yams in shining silver platters, with silver
spoons, and bottles o' wine, all in grand style, as quite comflogisticated
me; and 'What cheer&mdash;what cheer, shipmate?' says they; and then
they axed me to take some grub with 'em, which in course I did.
She'd a noble 'tween decks,&mdash;broad in the beam, with plenty o' room
to swing hammocks; but, instead of finding ounly twenty hands, I'm
blowed if there warn't more nor a hundred. So arter I'd had a good
tuck-out, I goes on deck again and looks about me. She was a corvette,
flush fore and aft, with a tier of port-holes, but ounly six guns
mounted; and never even in a man-o'-war did I see everything so snug
and neat. 'Well, your honour, I'm ready to sign articles,' says
I.&mdash;'Very good,' says he; and down we goes into the cabin; and, my
eyes! but there was a set-out,&mdash;gold candlesticks and lamps, and
large silver figures, like young himps, and clear looking-glasses, and
silk curtains, and handsome sofas; and there upon one on 'em sat a
beautiful young creatur, with such a pair of large full eyes as blue
as the sky, and white flaxen hair that hung like fleecy clouds about
her forehead,&mdash;it made a fellow think of heaven and the angels: but
she never smiled, shipmates,&mdash;there was a moloncholy about the
lower part of her face as showed she warn't by no manner o' means
happy; and whilst the skipper was getting the articles out of the
locker, she motioned to me, but I couldn't make out what she meant.
The skipper did, though; for he turned round in a fury, and stamped
on the cabin deck as he lifted up the black patch, and a stream of
light for all the world like the glow of a furnace through a chink in a
dark night fell upon her. He had his back to me, so I couldn't make
out where the light came from; but the poor young lady gave a
skreek and fell backard on the sofa. Now, messmates, I'd obsarved
that when he stamped with his foot that it warn't at all like a nat'ral
human stamp, for it came down more like the hoof of a horse or a
box; and thinks I to myself, 'I'm d&mdash;, Bob, but you're in for it now;
the skipper must be a devil of a fellow to use such a lovely creatur
arter that fashion.'&mdash;'You're right, my man,' says he, grinning like
one o' them faces on the cat-head, 'he <i>is</i> a <i>devil</i> of a fellow.'&mdash;'I
never spoke not never a word, your honour,' says I, thrown all aback
by the concussion. 'No, but you thought it,' says he; 'don't trouble
yourself to deny it: tell lies to everybody else, if you pleases, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>
it's no use selling 'em to me.'&mdash;'God forbid, your&mdash;' I was going to
say 'honour,' but he stopped me with another stamp, and 'Never
speak that name in my presence again,' says he; 'if you do, it ull
be the worse for you. Come and sign the articles.' My eyes! shipmates,
but I was in a pretty conflobergasticationment; there stood
the skipper, with a bright steel pen in his hand as looked like a doctor's
lanchet, and there close by his side, upon her beam-ends, laid
that lovely young creatur, the sparkling jewels in her dress mocking
the wretchedness of her countenance. 'Are you ready?' says he;
and his onkivered eye rolled round and round, and seemed to send
out sparks through the friction. 'Not exactly, your honour,' says I,
'for I carn't write, in regard o' my having sprained both ankles, and
got a twist in my knee-joint when I warn't much higher than a quart
pot.'&mdash;'That's a lie, Bob,' says he; and so it was, messmates, for I
thought I must make some excuse to save time. 'Howsomever,'
says he, 'you can make your mark.'&mdash;Thinks I so myself, 'I would
pretty soon, my tight un, if I had you ashore.'&mdash;'I know it,' says
he; 'but you're aboard now, and so you may either sign or not, just
as it suits your fancy, my man; ounly understand this&mdash;if you don't
sign, you shall be clapped in irons, and fed upon iron hoops and
scupper-nails for the next six months, and I wish you a good
disgestion.'&mdash;'Thanky, your honour,' says I; 'and what if I do
sign?'&mdash;'Why then,' says he, 'you shall live like a fighting-cock,
and have as much suction as the Prince of Whales.' Well, shipmates,
I was just like the Yankee's schooner when she got jammed atwixt two
winds, and so I thought there could be no very great damage in
making a scratch or two upon a bit o' parchment; and 'All right,
your honour,' says I; 'hand us over the pen: but your honour hasn't
got not never an inkstand.'&mdash;'That's none o' your business,' says he;
'if you are resolved to sign, I'll find materials.'&mdash;'Very good,' says
I; 'I'll just make my mark.'&mdash;'Hould up!' says he to the young lady;
and she scringed all together in a heap, and shut her large blue
eyes as she held up a beautiful white round arm, bare up to the shoulder:
it looked as solid and as firm as a piece of marble stationery."</p>

<p class="indent">"Statuary, you mean," said Sam Slick, interrupting the
narrative. "But I say, Bob, do you expect us to believe all this?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I believes every word on it," asserted Jemmy Ducks,
who had been attentively listening, with his mouth wide open to catch all
that was uttered: "what can you find onnat'ral or dubersome about it?
The skipper was no doubt a black-hearted nigger."</p>

<p class="indent">"Nigger yousef, Massa Jemmy Ducks," exclaimed Mungo
Pearl; "d&mdash;you black heart for twist 'em poultry neck."</p>

<p class="indent">"Silence there in amidships," said Mr. Parallel: "you
make so much noise that I can't keep my glass steady. Spin your yarns, Mr.
Pearl, with your mouth shut, like an oyster;" and then, addressing
the captain, "We rise her fast, my lord, and the breeze freshens: the
ould beauty knows she's got some work cut out for her; she begins
to smell garlic, and walks along like an ostrich on the stretch&mdash;legs
and wings, and all in full play."</p>

<p class="indent">"What distance are we from Toulon?" inquired Lord Eustace,
as he carefully and anxiously scanned the stranger through his glass.</p>

<p class="indent">"About nine leagues," promptly answered Mr. Parallel; "and
if the breeze houlds on, or comes stronger, another three hours will
carry us alongside of the enemy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"We shall soon have her within reach of the bow-guns," said the
first lieutenant, "and a shot well thrown may take in some of her canvass."</p>

<p class="indent">"That's a good deal of it chance-work," responded the master;
"it mought and it moughtn't; but firing is sure to frighten the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Spirits of the wind," added Nugent, who stood close beside him;
"they become alarmed and take to flight,
and so we lose the flapping of their airy wings."</p>

<p class="indent">"Hairy grandmother," grumbled old Parallel, "hairy wings
indeed; why, who ever seed such a thing? Spirits of wind, too,&mdash;rum
spirits, mayhap, to cure flatulency. Stick to natur, Mr. Nugent,
or she'll be giving us another squall, just out o' revenge for being ridiculed."</p>

<p class="indent">"Get on with your yarn, Bobbo," said Joe Nighthead in an under
tone; "and just you take a reef in your bellows,
Mister Mungo, and don't speak so loud again."</p>

<p class="indent">"Where was I?" inquired Bob thoughtfully: "oh, now I
recollect;&mdash;down in the cabin, going to sign the articles. 'Are you
quite ready?' says the skipper to me as he raised the pen. 'All ready,'
says I.&mdash;'Then hould up,' says he to the young lady, and she raised
her fair arm. 'Come here, my man,' says he again to me, and I
clapped him close alongside at the table; 'be ready to grab hould o'
the pen in a moment, and make your mark <i>there</i>,' and he pointed to a
spot on the parchment, with a brimstone seal stamped again it&mdash;you
might have smelt it, messmates, for half a league&mdash;and, I'm blessed
if I didn't have a fit o' the doldrums; but, nevertheless, I put a bould
face upon it, and, 'Happy go lucky,' says I, 'all's one to Bob!' and
then there was another rustling noise down the leg of his trousers,
and his eye&mdash;that's his onkivered one&mdash;flashed again, and took to
rolling out sparks like a flint-mill; 'Listen, my man,' says he, 'to what
I'm going to say, and pay strict attention to it'&mdash;'I wool, your honour,'
says I; 'but hadn't the lady better put down her arm?' says I; 'it
ull make it ache, keeping it up so long.'&mdash;'Mind your own business,
Bob Martingal,' says he, quite cantankerously; 'she's houlding the
inkstand.'&mdash;'Who's cracking now, your honour?' says I laughing;
'the lady arn't got not nothing whatsomever in her hand. I'm blowed
if I don't think you all carries out the name o' the craft In-fun-oh.'&mdash;'Right,'
says he; 'and now attend. If after I have dipt this here
pen in the ink, you refuse to sign the articles&mdash;you have heard o'
this?' and he touched the black patch. I gave a devil-may-care sort
of a nod. 'Well, then, if you refuses to sign, I'll nillyate you.'&mdash;'Never
fear,' says I, making out to be as bould as a lion, for there
was ounly he and I men-folk in the cabin; and, thinks I to myself,
'I'm a match for him singly at any rate.'&mdash;'You're mistaken,' says
he, 'and you'll find it out to your cost, if you don't mind your behaviour,
Bob Martingal.'&mdash;'I never opened my lips, your honour,'
says I.&mdash;'Take care you don't,' says he, 'and be sure to obey orders.'
He turned to the lady. 'Are you prepared, Marian?' axes he; but
she never spoke. 'She's faint, your honour,' says I, 'God bless her!'
The spiteful wretch give me a red-hot look, and his d&mdash;&mdash; oncivil
cloven foot&mdash;for I'd swear to the mark it made&mdash;came crushing on
my toes, and made me sing out blue blazes. 'Is that obeying orders?'
says he: 'didn't I command you never to use that name afore me?'&mdash;'You
did, your honour,' says I; 'but you might have kept your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>
hoof off my toes, seeing as I haven't yet signed articles.'&mdash;'It was an
accident,' says he, 'and here's something to buy a plaster;' and he
throws down a couple of doubloons, which I claps into my pocket.
'You enter woluntarily into my service, then?' says he.&mdash;'To be sure
I do,' says I, though I'm blessed if I wouldn't have given a treble
pork-piece to have been on shore again.&mdash;'And you'll make your
mark to that?' says he, 'and ax no further questions?'&mdash;'To be sure
I will,' says I; and I'll just tell you what it is, messmates, I'm blowed
if ever I was more harder up in my life than when I seed him raise
the pen, as looked like a sharp lanchet, in his infernal thieving-hooks,
and job it right into that beautiful arm, and the blood spun out, and
the lady gave a skreek; and 'Sign&mdash;sign!' says he; 'quick, my man&mdash;your
mark!'&mdash;'No, I'm d&mdash;if I do,' says I; 'let blood be on them
as sheds it.'&mdash;'You won't?' says he.&mdash;'Never, you spawn o' Bellzebub!'
says I; for I'd found him out, shipmates.&mdash;'Then take the consequences,'
says he; and up went the black patch, and, by the Lord
Harry! he sported an eye that nobody never seed the like on in their
lives; it looked as big and as glaring as one o' them red glass bottles
of a night-time as stands in the potecarry's windows with a lamp behind
'em; but it was ten thousand times more brilliant than the
fiercest furnace that ever blazed,&mdash;you couldn't look upon it for a
moment; and I felt a burning heat in my heart and in my stomach,
as if I'd swallowed a pint of vitriol; and my strength was going away
and I was withering to a hatomy, when all at once I recollects a
charm as my ould mother hung round my neck when I was a babby,
and I snatches it off and houlds it out at arm's length right in his
very face. My precious eyes and limbs! how he did but caper about
the cabin, till his hat fell off, and there was his two fore-tack bumkins
reg'larly shipped over his bows and standing up with a bit of a twist
outwards just like the head-gear of a billy-goat. 'Keep off, you bitch's
babby!' says I, for he tried onknown schemes and man&oelig;uvres to get
at me; till suddenly I hears a loud ripping of stitches, and away went
the casings of his lower stancheons, and out came a tail as long&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Almost as long as your'n, I suppose," said old Jack
Sheavehole; "a precious yarn you've been spinning us, Mister Bob!"</p>

<p class="indent">"But what became of the lady?" inquired Sam Slick; "and what a
lubber of a tailor he must have been to have performed his work so badly!"</p>

<p class="indent">"The lady?" repeated Bob; "why, I gets her in tow under
my arm, and shins away up the companion-ladder, the ould fellow chasing
me along the deck with a boarding-pike, his tail sticking straight out
abaft, just like a spanker-boom over his starn; but the charm kept
him off, and away I runs to the gangway, where the shore-boat and
the nigger were waiting, and you may guess, shipmates, I warn't long
afore we were hard at work at the paddles; for I laid the lady down
in the bottom o' the punt, and 'Give way, you bit of ebony,' says I,
'or Jumbee 'ull have you stock and fluke.' Well, if there warn't a
bobbery aboard the In-fun-oh, there never was a bobbery kicked up in
the world; and 'Get ready that gun there!' shouted the skipper."</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment the heavy booming of a piece of ordinance
was heard sounding across the water. Up jumped Jemmy Ducks, and
roared out, "Oh Lord! oh dear!&mdash;there's the devil again!&mdash;what
shall I do!" and a general laugh followed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"The chase is trying his range, my lord," exclaimed Mr. Seymour;
"but the shot must have fallen very short, as we couldn't hear it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Keep less noise on the fokesel," said old Parallel.
"What ails that lubberly wet-nurse to all the geese in the ship? Ay, ay, he'll
have hould on you by-and-by! Get a pull of that topmast-stud'nsel tack."</p>

<p class="indent">The men immediately obeyed; and, as they were coming
up fast with the enemy, excitement and impatience put an end to long yarns.
But Bob just squeezed out time to tell them that he got safe ashore
with the lady; and the "In-fun-oh" tripped her anchor that same
tide, dropped down the river, and put to sea, nor was she ever heard
of again afterwards. The lady was the daughter of a rich merchant
in Baltimore, who had been decoyed away from her family, but by
the worthy tar's instrumentality was happily restored again. Bob got
a glorious tuck-out aboard, the two doubloons were safe in his pocket,
and the father of Marian treated him like a prince.</p>

<p class="indent">Half an hour elapsed from the first discharge of the enemy's
sternchaser, when he again tried his range; and, to prove how rapidly they
were nearing each other, the shot this time passed over the British
frigate. There was something exhilarating to the ears of the seamen
in the whiz of its flight. Two or three taps on the drum aroused
every man to his quarters; the guns were cast loose, and the bowchasers
cleared away for the officers to practise. Heavy bets were
made relative to hitting the target, the iron was well thrown, and
every moment increased the eagerness of the tars to get fairly alongside.
The land was rising higher and higher out of the water,&mdash;the
French port was in view,&mdash;the enemy began to exult in the prospect
of escape, when an eighteen-pounder, pointed by the hands of the old
master, brought down her maintop-gallant-mast; and the Frenchman,
finding it was utterly impossible to get away without fighting, shortened
sail, and cleared for action. Three cheers hailed this man&oelig;uvre.
The British tars now made certain of their prize; and, when within
half pistol-shot, in came the Spankaway's flying-kites, and in five
minutes he was not only under snug commanding canvass, but the moment
they returned to their quarters they passed close under the
French frigate's stern, and steadily poured in a raking broadside,
every shot doing its own proper duty, and crashing and tearing the
enemy's stern-frame to pieces, ploughing up the decks as they ranged
fore and aft, and diminishing the strength of their opponents by no
less than twenty-seven killed and wounded. Still the Frenchman
fought bravely, and handled his vessel in admirable style. Six of the
Spankaway's lay dead, and thirteen wounded. Amongst the latter
was our worthy old friend Will Parallel, the master; a splinter had
struck him on the breast, and he was carried below insensible. Sea-fights
have so often been described, that they have now but little novelty;
let it therefore suffice, that, in fifty-six minutes from the first
broadside, the tricoloured flag came down, and the national frigate
<i>Hippolito</i>, mounting forty-four guns, struck to his Britannic Majesty's
ship the Spankaway, whose first lieutenant, Mr. Seymour, was sent
aboard to take possession, as a prelude to that step which he was now
certain of obtaining. Thus two nights of labour passed away, and the
triumph of the second made ample amendment for the misfortunes of
the first; besides enabling the warrant-officers to expend their stores,
and not a word about the white squall.

Thomas Wharton, Earl of Wharton, appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,
April 21, 1709. How Addison became the secretary of this Verres, as delineated
by Swift,&mdash;or how Wharton, who professed to think virtue to be only a
name, and would not have given a guinea as the purchase-price of the best reputation,
obtained the appointment of the Queen's vicegerent in Ireland,&mdash;would
be matters of perfect astoundment, were it not known that Wharton forced himself
upon Lord Godolphin, by showing him a treasonable letter of that lord's to the
abdicated family, of which he had contrived to become the possessor. Wharton's
vice-regal power was but of short duration; he was recalled: Lords Justices
were appointed in the September of the same year, and Wharton returned
to England to make a bad use of the letter. Godolphin had, however, been too
cunning for him, and procured an act of grace in his absence, which enabled
him to set the vengeance of the Lord Lieutenant at defiance. As an apology
for Addison's serving under such a man, it may be urged, that the acceptance of
the office so proffered implied no approbation of his crimes; and that a subordinate
officer is under no obligation to examine the opinions or conduct of those
under whom he acts, excepting that he may not be made the actual tool of his
atrocities or crimes.

Addison's habitual taciturnity and fondness for the bottle are well known.
There is a story, not yet forgotten, that the profligate Duke of Wharton, who was,
perhaps, only the reputed or imputed son of this earl, afterwards Marquis of
Wharton, once at table plied Addison so briskly with wine, in order to make
him talk, that he could not retain it in his stomach. His grace is said to have
observed, that "he could get wine, but not wit out of him."

Lord Godolphin conferred on Addison, as a reward for his poem entitled
<i>The Campaign</i>, commemorative of the battle of Blenheim, the place of Commissioner
of Appeals, in the room of the celebrated Locke, who had been appointed
a Lord of Trade. The year following, he attended Lord Halifax to Hanover;
and, in the next, was appointed secretary to Sir Charles Hedges, and was continued
in that office by his successor, Charles Spencer, Earl of Sunderland.

Addison was a sound Whig. Bolingbroke records, that, after the peace
which followed the ever memorable battle of Blenheim, he engaged with Addison
in a two hours' conversation, and their politics differed <i>toto c&aelig;lo</i>
from each other.

Budgell has recorded that he attended Lord Halifax and Addison in a
barge to Greenwich to meet George the First from Hanover. Halifax said he
expected to have the Treasurer's staff, and to have great influence; that he would
endeavour to avoid some of the errors of late reigns, and make his master a
great king, and would recommend Addison to be a secretary of state. Addison,
as Budgell says, blushed, and thanked him for such honourable friendship,
but declared that his merits and ambition did not carry him to so high a place.
Halifax was, however, circumvented in all his speculations: Walpole acquired
more influence, or succeeded by intrigue; and the effects mortified Lord Halifax
so acutely, that a pulmonary fever was the consequence, and death soon put a
quietus upon his lordship's unsuccessful struggle for power.

Congreve first introduced Addison to the notice of lord Halifax while
being educated at Oxford for the church, when his lordship is said to have
dedicated Addison to the state, and avowed he would never do the church any
other harm than in keeping him out of it. The post which Addison here alludes
to, was that of secretary to Lord Sunderland, who was then appointed
to the Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland, but never went to Dublin to assume the
vice-regal dignity. Addison evidently deemed that appointment a degradation,
and much inferior to that of being secretary to the Lords Regent of the kingdom
till the arrival of the new King. As to his having been in Lord Sunderland's
employ formerly, it has reference to his being his lordship's secretary upon the
earl's succeeding Sir Charles Hedges, as Secretary of State, in 1706.

This assertion seems strange, when it is known that in 1711, long prior to
his marriage with the Countess of Warwick, Addison had expended ten thousand
pounds upon the purchase of the Bilton estate, near Rugby, in Warwickshire:
and Oldmixon, in his History, says, Addison left by his will, in 1719, to
his daughter and to Lady Warwick, his fortune, which was about twelve thousand
pounds. His daughter, who resided at Bilton till her death, in 1797, enjoyed
an income of more than twelve hundred pounds per annum.</p></div>

Journals record that on a petition against his election for Lestwithiel, in 1708,
he was found not duly elected; but by Lord Wharton's interest at the general
election, he was chosen member for Malmesbury: indeed, as Swift wrote to
Stella, so popular had Addison then become, that "if he had stood for the
kingship, he would have been chosen."

Ambrose Phillips, "one of the wits at Button's," and Addison's constant
associate at that resort of the literati. In the latter part of Queen Anne's reign,
being a Whig, he was secretary to the Hanover Club, and was, soon after the
accession of George the First, put into the commission of the peace; and, in
1717, appointed one of the Commissioners of the Lottery. Paul Whitehead
relates that when Addison became Secretary of State, Phillips applied to him
for some preferment, but was coolly answered, that it was thought he was already
provided for, by being made a justice for Westminster. To this observation
Phillips with some indignation replied, "Though poetry was a trade
he could not live by, yet he scorned to owe subsistence to another which he
ought not to live by." Phillips will be long remembered by his translation from
Racine of the tragedy of the "Distressed Mother." He died, struck with
palsy, in Hanover-street, Hanover-square, June 18, 1749.

Young Craggs was the son of a <i>barber</i>, who, by his merit, became
Postmaster-general, and home-agent to the Duke of Marlborough; he was one of
the first characters of the age, and had distinguished himself in the House of
Commons. The classical names of Damon and Pythias, of Pylades and Orestes,
of Nisus and Euryalus, are not oftener found conjoined in ancient story than those
of Addison and Craggs in the real life of modern times. Addison, notwithstanding
the discomfiture evinced in these letters, succeeded in procuring the appointment
of a Lord Commissioner at the Board of Trade, which post he held till he
was made Secretary of State, April 16, 1717. But Addison was then fast sinking
into a bad habit of body: his great care was how to live, and, as Tacitus
Gordon, his great admirer, used to relate, was then killing himself in drinking
the widow Trueby's water, spoken of in the "Spectator." Unfit for the drudgery
of a political life,&mdash;the pack-horse of the state,&mdash;he pleaded the being incapable
of supporting the fatigues of his office, and resigned the seals in March
1718, upon a pension from the King of seventeen hundred pounds per annum.
Craggs, who was his successor, died prematurely and unmarried, in his twenty-eighth year, in 1721.

Addison, it is said, was first introduced into the Warwick family as tutor of
the young lord here mentioned. The earl died soon after the date of this letter;
and Addison, at forty-five, took great pains to woo the countess, who is described
as being personally fraught with half the pride of the nation. They were married
in August 1716, though not happily; for tradition reports they were seldom
in each other's company. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, in a letter to Pope,
written from the East, after this period, says, "I received the news of Addison's
being declared Secretary of State with the less surprise, in that I knew that post
was almost offered to him before. At that time he declined it; and I really
believe he would have done well to have declined it now. Such a post as that,
and such a wife as the countess, do not seem to be in prudence eligible for a
man that is asthmatic; and we may see the day when he will be heartily glad to
resign them both."

and a sister of Addison's, who is married to Mons. Sartre, a Frenchman, prebendary
of Westminster. Addison's sister is a sort of wit, very like him: I am
not fond of her." She married, secondly, Daniel Combes, Esq. Addison bequeathed
her in his will five hundred pounds, which she lived to enjoy till
March 2, 1750. The "other namesake" was possibly Addison's other brother,
Lancelot, who, Chalmers states, was fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and
an able classical scholar.

<span class="label">[86]</span></a> The original of this letter having been forwarded in
an envelope, and wanting the notation, at foot of the first page, of the name of the
person to whom addressed, leaves it a conjecture who his grace was, whether Ormond or
Grafton. Charles Spencer, Earl of Sunderland, is the Lord Lieutenant whose
illness Addison describes. The earl never went to Ireland to assume the vice-regal
dignity; and, though this has never been satisfactorily accounted for, the
real causes were, in all probability, his lordship's continued indisposition, and
the death of Anne, Countess-dowager of Sunderland, his mother. Charles
Duke of Grafton, and Henry Earl of Galway, were appointed Lords Justices of Ireland, Nov. 1, 1715.

Henry IV. Part 1. Act iii. Sc. 3.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Fal.</i> Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery, lad?</span>
<span class="i5">How is that answered?</span>
<span class="i0"><i>P. Hen.</i>             My sweet beef, I must</span>
<span class="i7">Still be good angel to thee.</span>
<span class="i7">The money is paid back.</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fal.</i>                  I do not like</span>
<span class="i4">That paying back; it is a double labour.</span>
<span class="i0"><i>P. Hen.</i> I am good friends with my father, and may do anything.</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fal.</i> Rob me the exchequer, the first thing thou dost;</span>
<span class="i4">And do't with unwashed hands too.</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Bard.</i>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Do, my lord."</span>
</div></div>

<p>The quiet and business-like manner in which Bardolph enforces on the heir-apparent
his master's reasonable proposition of robbing the exchequer, is worthy
of that plain and straightforward character. I have always considered it a
greater hardship that Bardolph should be hanged "for pix of little price" by an
old companion at Gadshill, than that Falstaff should have been banished. But
Shakspeare wanted to get rid of the party; and as, in fact, a soldier was
hanged in the army of Henry V. for such a theft, the opportunity was
afforded. The king is not concerned in the order for his execution however,
which is left with the Duke of Exeter.</p>

<p>I have omitted a word or two from the ordinary editions in the above quotation,
which are useless to the sense and spoil the metre. A careful consideration
of Falstaff's speeches will show that, though they are sometimes printed as
prose, they are in almost all cases metrical. Indeed, I do not think that
there is much prose in any of Shakspeare's plays.

These passages also are printed as prose: I have not
altered a single letter, and the reader will see not only that they are dramatical blank-verse,
but dramatical blank-verse of a very excellent kind. After all the editions of Shakspeare,
another is sadly wanted. The text throughout requires a searching critical revision.

This is printed as prose, but assuredly it is blank verse. The alteration of
a syllable or two, which in the corrupt state of the text of these plays is the
slightest of all possible critical licenses, would make it run perfectly smooth. At
all events, in the second line, "emulation" should be "emulative," to make it
agree with the other clauses of the sentence. The courtier's melancholy is not
<i>pride</i>, nor the soldier's <i>ambition</i>, &amp;c. The adjective is used
throughout,&mdash;<i>fantastical, proud, ambitious, politic, nice</i>.

Formerly, that is to say, previous to the peace of 1815, a journey between
Quebec and Sandwich was an undertaking considerably more tedious and troublesome
than the voyage from London to Quebec. In the first place, the commissariat
of the expedition had to be cared for; and to that end every gentleman
who was liable to travel had, as a part of his appointments, a provision basket,
which held generally a cold round of beef, tin plates and drinking-cups, tea,
sugar, biscuits, and about a gallon of brandy. These, with your wardrobe and
a camp-bed, were stowed away in a batteau, or flat-bottomed boat; and off you
set with a crew of seven stout, light-hearted, jolly, lively Canadians, who sung
their boat-songs all the time they could spare from smoking their pipe. You
were accompanied by a fleet of similar boats, called a brigade, the crews of
which assisted each other up the rapids, and at night put into some creek, bay,
or uninhabited island, where fires were lighted, tents made of the sails, and the
song, the laugh, and the shout were heard, with little intermission, all the night
through; and if you had the felicity to have among the party a fifer or a fiddler,
the dance was sometimes kept up all night,&mdash;for, if a Frenchman has a fiddle,
sleep ceases to be a necessary of life with him. This mode of travelling was far
from being unpleasant, for there was something of romance and adventure in it;
and the scenes you witnessed, both by night and day, were picturesque in the
highest degree. But it was tedious; for you were in great luck if you arrived
at your journey's end in a month; and if the weather were boisterous, or the
wind a-head, you might be an indefinite time longer.</p>

<p>"But your march of improvement is a sore destroyer of the romantic and
picturesque. A gentleman about to take such a journey now-a-days, orders his
servant to pack his portmanteau, and put it on board the John Molson, or any
of his family; and at the stated hour he marches on board, the bell rings, the
engine is put in motion, and away you go smoking, and splashing, and walloping
along, at the rate of ten knots an hour, in the ugliest species of craft that
ever disfigured a marine landscape."

objected that a lady like Miss Juliana Smashaway, born in
Crutched Friars, and educated in a select seminary at Kennington
Cross, should use the well-known <i>Hibernicism</i>, "This beats Banaher."
But let it be remembered that she was devotedly attached to Captain Connor;
consequently, often in his company; and hence naturally would adopt the language
of one whom she "loved not wisely, but too well." The same remark is
applicable to the term "<i>Too-roo</i>," used by Netty in the beautiful

Eusebius, in his "<i>Histoire Ecclesiastique</i>," (liv. ii. chap. 7,) relates that,
about forty years after the birth of Christ, and under the reign of Caligula, Pontius
Pilate was recalled from the government of Judea to Rome, and, fearing the
consequences with which his conduct was threatened, he committed suicide; but
he does not say where this fact occurred. Naucler tells us that Pilate, having
been banished to Lyons by the emperor, there died by his own sword; and
other authors, among whom is Otho of Frisinguen, assert that, being exiled by
Caligula, he threw himself into the Rhone at Vienne in Dauphiny, and was
drowned. He adds, that, according to the statement of the inhabitants of that
neighbourhood, the river has ever since that period, at certain intervals, been extremely
difficult and dangerous to navigate.&mdash;(Vide <i>Pa Chronique</i>, liv. iii. chap. 13.)

This mountain lake is situated in the centre of a small forest of dark and
time-worn pines, and is surrounded by bogs and marshes. In form it is nearly
elliptical, being one hundred and fifty-four feet long, and seventy-eight broad,
and it is in no part more than four feet deep. In the year 1560 it was measured
by Cisat, and, according to his account of its dimensions, was at that time just
one-third less than it is know known to be now; but whether his admeasurement was
defective, or whether the body of water has actually increased since that period,
may be matter of doubt.
